22 December 2000,Amazing performance shines through,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",9
23 June 2017,Not a film to cast away...,"Quite the opposite. Admire both Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks, and honestly feel that 'Cast Away' is among the best work of both. It is long and the opposite of feel good, but utterly riveting, thanks to the bold risk-taking and Hanks giving a performance for the ages.

'Cast Away' has been criticised by some for having an unsatisfying ending. It is understandable as to why it is polarising, and why it is seen as inconclusive and depressing to some wanting something happy. Count me in as somebody who found the ending incredibly powerful and who cannot fail to tear up. Have been picky about endings recently and the inconclusive nature didn't bother me that much and actually appreciated that it was more downbeat rather than happy, who to me would have felt a little too on the pat side.

There are so many great things about 'Cast Away' that help make it quite a superb film. Zemeckis' direction is some of his boldest, there are some courageous risks taken like his use of camera work and done in an ingenious way and not overdone. Even better is Hanks' one for the ages almost one-man show performance, sometimes not saying much but expressing a lot in a nuanced way. He is instrumental in making the island and his resilience in struggling to survive riveting viewing and he does so phenomenally.

It is a very well made film too, beautifully and cleverly photographed, atmospherically lit and with a lovingly created island setting. They blend so well with the film's tone and with its boldness. The score avoids from being overwrought, while there is a beautifully constructed script that provokes a lot of thought and wide range of emotions. While deliberately paced, the story is an engrossing one, with a excellently harrowing plane crash and the very telling section on the island that to me didn't drag at all even with events being a little on the slight side. Plus there aren't many times when you feel so much for a volleyball, you do here.

While the other characters aren't as well written or as interesting as Hanks', it is not in a way to bring down the film in any way. Helen Hunt makes a moving impression even with limited screen time, her meeting with Hanks one of the film's most powerful moments.

In conclusion, a powerful, bold and superbly acted, directed and made film that is moving without the audience being forced or manipulated into feeling so. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10
28 May 2020,Excellent film gave me goosebumps,"Crazy that Tom Hanks didn't win the nominations that year! A captivating stranding of wonderfulness, gloriously directed by Robert Zemeckis! I like how there's a bit of comedy despite the circumstances. I love stories about unfortunate things happening where characters are stuck somewhere that deal with many things. Cast Away is legendary even many years later.

14 October 2002,Definitely worth a couple viewings.,"I'll be honest, the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too sure if I liked it. I mean, I certainly enjoyed it, but I just wasn't too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole. I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around. And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan, so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first. But, all in all, I've watched the film enough times now that I can say ""I love this film!!!""

When I really stop and think about it, the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, ""Forrest Gump""). The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor. Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual. You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island. Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work. As much as I liked Russell Crow in ""Gladiator"", I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar). Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance. There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.

This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch. There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island. So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook. So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it. Thanks for reading,

8 March 2002,Outstanding,"I think this is an excellent movie..I've noticed many felt it ""too long, boring, etc..."" which is to be expected in today's ""gimme non-stop action; I haven't been doing anything for 5 minutes, I'm bored"" mentality. This was a true man vs nature movie that really made me think about what I take for granted and I found myself wondering how I would react in such a situation. Would I talk to a volleyball? you betcha...anyone who has spent any significant time alone can relate. Bought the DVD and will watch it for years too come.

14 March 2002,well-crafted and intriguing,"From director Robert Zemeckis comes this powerful character study of a man and his quest for survival. Hanks is a time-obsessed postal worker on a routine cargo transport. His life is forever changed after the plane crashes and he finds himself stranded all alone on an uncharted island. We're drawn into his long, arduous journey as he struggles not only to keep his sanity, but to stay alive so he can make it back to the love of his life (Hunt). A fascinating, believable, and thought-provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live, with a remarkably ideal performance from Tom Hanks, and steady, effectively leisure direction that allows viewers to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey. A small idea expanded into a one of a kind movie. ***½

12 October 2007,A wonderfully silent drama with Hanks and Wilson spiritually sensational,"At the turn of the millennium technology started to get bigger and better. Films were starting to develop in a way that was never predicted, but so did the actors. After watching Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump 1994, I thought I had seen a true drama, but that was clearly only the beginning.

Tom Hanks (Big, Forrest Gump) stars in his Oscar nominated performance as Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex executive who is stranded on an isolated island after a thunderous plane crash.

When doing background research on this film, I was surprised to see that Russell Crowe had beaten Hanks to the Oscar in 2001. As good as Crowe was in Gladiator, I personally thought Hanks made the most sensational performance of his career here. Hanks' character Noland is truly remarkable. From being a comfortable and hard working executive at home with his long time girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt), to being an isolated figure in different circumstances. The change in character allows Hanks to express his full acting potential and dive deep within the soul of the character. It is a true battle of human intelligence and human power that Hanks does so well to give and some scenes really got to me, it is such a powerful role and does well to rival his other Oscar wins.

The text's semiotics are remarkably significant. Having left the wreckage of the plane with only a few supplies, Noland builds himself around what he can salvage and none is more recognizable, than Wilson. A silent volleyball, which was encoded into Cast Away so Hank's could use dialogue to express his traumatic emotions.

The plot is made exciting through various scenes. The plane crash is very dramatic and beautifully directed by Zemeckis and scenes shot on the island, when Hanks is alone and wandering what to do are silent and chilling, justifying the drama genre.

The beautiful island is contradicted by the drastic situation, a truly magnificent incentive.

The ending too is wonderful as it paves the way for many possibilities

18 August 2012,The most deserving film not in the top 250,"This movie is the most deserving of all movies out there that is not in the IMDb Top 250. In fact, this movie should be in the Top 100. Everything about it works, the cinematography, the locations, the acting, the story and this is Robert Zemeckis' greatest showpiece. Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing. The story is so well written in its simplicity, and Helen Hunt and Hanks have an amazing chemistry. It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together. I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile!

28 July 2007,What a fantastic film!!!,"I have never seen a more meaningful and thought-provoking film. Right from the start, I knew this was going to be a classic film, and my opinion was not changed throughout the course of the movie one bit. It delivers such a strong message of fear, survival and hope, that leaves your mind devoted to thinking about it for a long while after. It made me think about all my creature comforts, and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic! I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film, maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV, but anyway, it sort of made you guess how he was feeling, in a clever way. This is one of my all time favourite films, and I could watch it again and again without getting bored... so go and watch it...NOW!!

3 January 2015,Great one-man performance,"It's 1995. Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a FedEx systems analyst troubleshooting around the world. He is meticulous about time in his work. He comes home to spend the Christmas holidays with his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) in Memphis but he's called away. Before he leaves, he gives Kelly a box with a ring and declares ""I'll be right back."" His plane goes off course in the storm and crashes in the Pacific Ocean. He gets marooned on a deserted island with some of the packages washing on shore. His only companion is a volleyball he names Wilson.

This is one of the best one-man performance ever. The story itself isn't as compelling as one assumes. It is a lot of wave sounds while Tom Hanks discovers survival techniques through trial and error. Wilson is a fascinating invention. It's interesting that Robert Zemeckis doesn't insert a voice for him. It actually works very well. The movie can drag at certain places but Hanks is always a fascinating watch.

8 April 2002,Misunderstood,"I simply loved this film but was shocked by the bad reviews that people gave it. To this I say to them: You seriously misunderstood the meaning of it. Although I won't reveal any real details about the meaning because I think that you should try and understand it yourself. The movie was terrific and simply breathless the whole time. I felt awestruck about how the life of one man could be so changed after an experience that Hanks went through. I say that every element of the film was perfect. And for those of you who hate Wilson, you have to understand about how human he really was to Chuck. I was amazed on how well this movie was made and think that everybody should have an experience that should cause you to take stock of your life. I was so adamant to get this movie; I got it at 8:00 the day it was released. I give it an 8/10. Well done Robert

19 September 2021,Loved it,"I saw this in the cinema and loved it. Essentially a one-man-band show from Hanks who proves himself up to the challenge with an intense physical performance. Great scenery and the addition of 'Wilson' is the icing on the cake.

6 November 2019,The ultimate survivor,"Literally from the moment when humans began traveling the seas and oceans out of the sight of land, there have been tales of people being shipwrecked and marooned. Sometimes it is small groups of people on an uninhabited island, other times there are natives on the island and in a few cases, it is one person all alone. Different and more expanded versions of this story arose in science fiction after interplanetary travel became plausible. The recent hit movie ""The Martian"" is the best-known example of the lone person marooned. This movie is one where a single person somehow manages to survive a destructive plane crash and wash up on the beach of an uninhabited tropical island. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Nolan, an engineer with FedEx that is a hard driving, yet somewhat personable individual. He is flying as a passenger in a company cargo jet when they encounter a violent storm and there is an onboard explosion of some kind. Once on the island, Nolan needs to immediately satisfy his basic needs of food, water and shelter. He struggles to get a fire going, open a coconut and other basic tasks with no modern tools. Fortunately, a few packages from the plane wash up on the beach and he finds some useful items in them. After four years, he realizes that if he does not leave the island, he will die there alone and largely forgotten. This movie is nearly all Tom Hanks and he does a superb job of playing the increasingly eccentric exile in an odd form of solitary confinement. In order to keep himself sane, he must go a little insane, inventing a semi-imaginary companion to talk to. It is a worthy addition to the story of how humans can adapt in the most strenuous of circumstances and with no hope of any assistance.",10
10 October 2022,Tom Hanks or Daniel Day-Lewis,"They both have their place and there's room for both. These two actors, and I'll throw Sean Penn in there, are touched by God. It's hard to explain but when you see an actor you just know it. Feel it. My husband and I tend to gravitate toward actors rather than movies and then watch all of their work.

Tom and Daniel are truly transformational but their acting is always believable and authentic. My husband and I don't tend to get emotional at movies but Tom Hanks in Forest Gump, Philadelphia, this, etc. Seems to pull those emotional chords for us. Sean Penn did the same in Dead Man Walking. Day-Lewis did that for us in Lincoln. Touched by God.

22 April 2007,I was deeply touched,"******This may contain spoilers******

It's a superb,well directed and well acted movie!Well done,Hanks!!!

I'm a Hanks fan!!!I really appreciate his outstanding performance.I consider him a genius in acting.He never just acts.However,he gives life to his characters ,and makes himself exactly what they are.Forrest Gump,Saving Private Ryan,The Terminal,The Da Vinci Code,including this movie are all my favorites.I'm always deeply touched by his movies.And they often make me cry,make me think,and make me understand more about life and love.Cast Away is without exception.

I was moved by Chuck's spirits. His imagination(he names a volleyball Wilson and talks with him as a friend),his perseverance toward love,and his courage to face problems,all these enable him to survive and finally return to his homeland.

When Chuck and Kelly embraced each other in the rain, I burst out crying.They are true lovers.But,fate is cruel.His beloved fiancée,his only belief during those terrible days and nights is forever gone.His hope is disillusioned.He is standing at a life crossroads,thinking and hesitating.He has to choose a way to begin his new life.

I greatly recommend this movie.Don't feel boring,just be patient.I think movies are not only seen by eyes,but also by heart.Use your heart to feel what the characters feel.Then the more you see it,the more you'll be inspired and the more you'll find.Finally,hope you enjoy other Hanks movies!!!",10
27 February 2018,"Cast Away shows that we yearn to survive, not for ourselves, but for love.","A classic shipwreck tale that is flipped into a love story. This isn't just about surviving a deserted island with limited resources. No! It's about testing our limitations and capabilities, proving that even the faintest of glimpses of humanity still resides within us when all hope is lost. A FedEx employee travels on a plane, it crashes, he is washed ashore on a remote uncivilised island, he must survive. It sounds formulaic, uninteresting and all too familiar. Yet, the most overlooked director for the past few decades, manages to turn the simplest of plots into something much grander in scale. Time seems to be stationary for Chuck, who is marooned on this island for four years, however the rest of civilisation keeps on ticking. It doesn't hit you until the last thirty minutes where you suddenly become overwhelmed with emotion. You feel for him. You've witnessed him struggle for survival and even contemplate death. Only for the rest of the world to forget about him. It's a sad truth, but a poignant one. Chuck befriends a volleyball with a bloody hand print for a face, symbolising the need for social interaction. But more importantly, so that Chuck can shout ""WILSON!"" which, to me, is extremely satisfying. There is a really profound scene towards the end where Chuck walks around a buffet table looking at prepared crab and a lighter, things that we take for granted. Utterly resonating. So simple yet so powerful. Tom Hanks had a physically transformative role, although at times was slightly bland. Zemeckis' direction is the star. Easily one of his best directorial efforts. Love the camera angles at the beginning where it's conjoined with the FedEx post. I did find that the second act starts to lose steam, especially when we fast forward four years. I feel like some vital and pivotal moments were missed out. I wanted more Helen Hunt, just because I love her. However, Cast Away is another strong entry in Zemeckis' filmography and a decent acting performance from Hanks.",8
18 May 2003,Man VS. nature,"This is the only movie were you actually get emotional attached to a volleyball!

The movie starts of real good. We see Hanks as a guy that is always hasted and always have to beat the clock. When he strands on the Island (after an amazingly shot plane crash) he all of the sudden has all the time of the world and the movie turns into a man VS. nature battle were both challenge each other.

The are lot's of scene's were nothing really happens and are really slow but it never gets boring! And that's the power of this film.

Hanks once again shows his talent and he definitely is my favorite actor of this moment. Zemeckis directing, Burgess cinematography and some nice special effect and make up also do good to this movie.

My only points of critic: The time on the Island is to short, it last only about 1/3 of the movie and I really wanted to see more of Hanks on the Island because those are definitely the best scene's. Another thing, the movie is maybe a bit over dramatized at some moments. But oh well...

In a way a must see.

3 March 2014,"Incredible Performance from Tom Hanks,and That's All This Movie Needed to be Great,","Cast Away is a fantastic movie with an extremely well written and well developed storyline and a very talented cast (mainly just one cast member).I was very impressed with atom Hanks in this film,he proved that he can be a good actor even without have other actors around him,for the majority of this film he is the only person on screen,as we watch him stranded on an island as he loses his mind,Hanks stays dramatic and convincing all the way through.I was so impressed that the films script actually got me to feel for a football,Tom Hanks character starts communicating with a ball he calls Wilson because of it's brand,and after a while this character becomes ""his friend "" and it is only this man really has,and because of that I actually felt emotion for this lifeless ball,I was so impressed with the writers,Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for managing to do this.Cast Away is an outstanding drama that I would recommend to all moviegoers.

An obsessive executive for a delivery company finds himself stranded on a desert island after his flight ends in disaster.",9
11 March 2017,Utilizes Multiple Genres And Nails Them All,"In 1985, director Rob Zemeckis created perhaps the most genre-diverse film of all-time with Back To The Future. Fifteen years later, he came close to duplicating that extraordinary feat with Cast Away, an incredibly diverse movie in its own right.

For a basic plot summary, Cast Away tells the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx worker who goes down over the Pacific in an airplane, washes ashore a deserted island, and must fend for himself in the harsh terrain and conditions.

The key to this film is its ability to combine such genres as action, adventure, disaster, comedy, and drama and, most importantly, make them all mesh together and work on the big screen. All the pieces come together nicely to form a moving, exciting, always-moving (I never quite understand why some people consider it ""slow) plot & character development.

What really makes this movie a classic, however, is that it is a human interest flick at heart. The mental & physical struggle of Chuck is at center stage here, and the acting from Hanks is impeccable as usual (he can play anything!). It speaks volumes that, within 90 minutes, you may be expressing emotion towards a man's relationship with a volleyball.

Overall, I wish more movies would be produced like Cast Away. It has a little something for everyone. Though many film fans consider Forrest Gump to be Hanks' crowning achievement, I personally enjoy this effort tenfold, as here the multiple themes actually converge to form a coherent, dramatic narrative in the end. All in all, a great film that can be watched multiple times to catch the subtle nuances and character growth.",10
9 April 2019,ANOTHER AMAZING PERFORMANCE BY TOM HANKS.,"7.5 actually. Tom Hanks offers another amazing performance. (Probably his 2nd best after Forrest Gump) He can carry a full movie on his own by just using body language and emotion. And also the Wilson part is ridiculous. Haha. Well done. P.s. I love the symbolic ending. Its about destiny and future and having the choice to take your life in any direction of your preference. Nice.

I watched this movie like 15 years ago and I barely remember anything from it anyway I started watching the movie in the worst mental state I've ever been. Throughout the movie I settled down a bit felt comfortable, some cries then and there some laughs as well and that monologue at the last quarter of the movie truly saved my life when he said ""I've got to keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?"" What a brilliant movie absolutely wonderful, I hope things get better for anyone in a rough spot, take care all.

16 December 2006,"A Tom Hanks vehicle with Hanksisms, Hanky writing, Hanky melodrama","Tom Hanks stars as time-obsessed FedEx executive Chuck Noland who literally lives by the clock, even when spending time with his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) during the holidays. On Christmas Eve his beeper calls him to catch a last-minute FedEx flight to Malasya for official business and he waves ""I'll be right back"" before he boards. Then his plane crashes in the Pacific and Chuck is indefinitely marooned on a desert island, with only a volleyball as his company.

I have huge affection for 'desert island' premises and subscribe to the thinking that whatever you do with the execution, it will still be a wonderful experience. It simply cannot go wrong. It does not go wrong in 'Cast Away' either  although I would have loved to see more exploration of the lush island jungle  in fact, its island sequences are all golden. The only problem this film has is the lachrymose final act in which Hanks fades and director Zemeckis pulls up the directing chair and starts pouring in relations-melodrama to sew things together.

Everything up until this rote lukewarm point is well-crafted with patient strokes, courtesy of the film's protagonist. Tom Hanks, who put forward the idea for the film to Forrest Gump-pal Zemeckis, is in nearly every scene and carries so much dramatic weight, effortless leading man appeal and sympathy-laden charisma that he sucks you in entirely. Initially I applied some skepticism to judging his businessman character and it was not until the vivid, epileptic plane crash sequence that he started to absorb me. As the airplane was sinking into the deep blue with Chuck trapped inside (I can't imagine anything more frightening), you knew, judging by how much you were pulling for him, that he was our hero. This is man vs. nature at its best.

Upon waking up on the beach of the stormy desert island, Chuck is faced with some of the weapons mother nature has in her arsenal: you can feel the energy being slowly drained out of him during the first couple of days as he struggles to crack coconuts, find water, build shelter, make fire, catch fish and tend to his wounds. Insanity sweeps across the shore and Hanks aptly embodies the hard-edged, blood-spilled, sweat-dripping, tear-shedding transformation of a time-driven businessman to a primitive instinct-driven maroon. It is eerily crafted with an harmonic silence and sans your dutiful MacGyveresque inventions, scaffolds or nifty tools. Here is a mere man, seen through epic aerial shots and with underlying subtitles that spell out ""desperation"" and ""loneliness"", both of which Hanks assuredly and crisply exemplifies.

So then, what is really wrong with 'Cast Away'? Nothing  aside from marginal missteps  is wrong with the cast away part, it's the ending that that is not in-tune once Zemeckis wields his clear-cut, spelled-out and moralist trademarks. I refuse to spoil anything (mostly because I remember the film having been spoiled to me long before I sat down to watch it), just rest assured you will be begging to be taken back to the exciting island.

10 March 2010,"Underrated, excellent movie","Its such a shame that this movie would receive such bad press. The idea of just a man by himself on an island may seem boring and long-winded yet this movie isn't. It touches so many emotions, laughter, sadness, fear, tension. When released it was said to be one long advertisement for FedEx however this movie proves to be so much more than this. With a fantastic soundtrack, great storyline, great acting from Tom Hanks, this movie truly is something fantastic. Maybe a bit of a cliché, other than that the movie appears to be faultless and to find that it didn't make it onto the top 250 saddened me as the movie truly is something to be perhaps even considered a masterpiece.

13 July 2010,Hanks Pulls Off What Not Just Any Actor Could,"I remember being fairly dismissive about ""Cast Away"" upon its initial release before I'd seen it. I wasn't thrilled with the direction Robert Zemeckis had gone as a director (""Forrest Gump"" anyone?) and I was just about Tom Hanks-ed out by the time he made this. But then I saw it, and found myself impressed by both the direction and more notably by Hanks' performance.

The difficulty of that performance should not be underestimated. Hanks plays a man stranded on a desert island and spends the vast majority of time alone on screen. Even if there are better actors than Hanks out there, it takes a certain kind of screen presence to pull that off, and Hanks has it. His Academy Award nomination was richly deserved.

Grade: A-

16 January 2015,Counteracting Loneliness,"So much has been written about the performance of Tom Hanks. He is so convincing that for a while I actually thought this had happened to him. This is a story of loneliness. The Robinson Crusoe aspect is slowly developed as Hanks employs what knowledge he has to do the rudimentary things that are required to survive. Crusoe has Friday; Hanks has Wilson. The despair that develops as one begins to realize that he may die, never seeing another human being or experiencing some tenderness, is so disturbing. When Hanks walks around, arms in the air, announcing to the world that he has made fire, it's a primitive conquest that seems so grand yet so minuscule. The final scene in the film is so gut wrenching. No man is an island but a part of a greater universe. I'm not speaking from a religious foundation but that which is within us.

14 December 2008,a very strong performance in a very strong film,"The idea of a drama about a lone person being stranded on an island has always fascinated me as a moviegoer. In real life, there have been many castaways such as the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who spent half a decade alone on a tiny island off the coast of South America when he was confident that his ship, under deplorable conditions, would not make it back to port. Selkirk was probably the basis for this movie Cast Away. No, it's not a true story, but it's manufactured so well that if somebody was to tell you that it was based on an autobiography, you would probably believe it.

Cast Away stars Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a busybody FedEx executive who's ""all about time"", who soon discovers he has all the time in the world when his plane crashes into the ocean and he, alone, finds himself on a deserted island where he ekes on the barest living possible. He improvises his own shelter, tools, companions, and accepts the fact that help may never arrive and if it ever does, it may be too late for him.

This is an exceedingly wonderful movie. Not only is Tom Hanks the quintessential choice to play a castaway, but he does his performance so well that you quickly forget that you're spending most of your time looking at a superstar instead of a character. And you have to admire Hanks for his nerve to play such a character. When he first arrives on the island, Hanks is a tad bit obese, cleanly-shave, and perhaps a bit unsightly. When we effectively cut to a scene that takes place four years after his marooning on the island, he's a gaunt, scrawny survivalist with shrunken muscles, exposed ribs, and a hardly recognizable face through all of the beard and overgrown hair. In order to achieve this, production was shut down on the film for a whole year so that Hanks could lose a tremendous amount of weight and fit the description mentioned in the script. Now you have to admire an actor for such an undertaking.

Cast Away was nominated for two Academy Awards after its release at the dawn of the century. One was for Hanks himself, the other was for the sound design and the sound, next to Hanks, is the most important element in the movie. The film clocks at two and a half hours in length and it's not until about seventy-five percent of the way through that we even so much as hear a click of music. The soundtrack is taken up by amplified sounds that heighten the feeling of a lonely place. The crashing of the waves, the howl of the wind, the grinding of wood against wood as Tom Hanks vainly tries to build a fire, the list goes on. Without such incredible sound design, I don't think the island scenes of Cast Away would have been half as effective. And it's because of these two important elements that the movie stays interesting rather than bogging down as one might expect. I mean, after all, you're spending a long time just watching a lone man struggle to survive on an island. And it's not like he's doing anything incredible like wrestling with savage beasts or running from cannibals or anything like that. Just an average, everyday man just worrying about whether or not he's going to live long enough to see home again.

Before I conclude my review, I want to give just one warning. It has nothing to do with the film itself, it has to do with the advertisements. I saw the movie before I saw the trailers or the ads. And good thing I did, because I soon found out that the ads spoiled the movie from beginning to end in just a few minutes, ruining any feeling of question or the height of our expectations and thus, spoiling the integrity of the film. In short, see the movie, then watch the trailers if you want. As for the film itself, it gets an enormous amount of recommendation from me.",10

15 July 2010,Hanks shines,"For some, cast away will be boring and tedious. For the majority of the film , we watch Hanks as Chuck, fighting the odds to live another day and to one day, hopefully make it back home. It all takes part on a inhabited, isolated island. There not a lot to do except catch fish and smash open coconuts. But the film is not about surviving the harsh surrounding but instead about being mentally strong , fighting self physically problems and living for hope.

I can't see anyone else but Tom hanks playing Chuck. He has the likability factor and most importantly he can act. he puts in all his effort for this performance. He has to carry the whole film as he the only living talking thing on that island. He has to pull the audience in, make us care enough to wish and hope that he makes it off the island and thankfully, Hanks didn't let us down. There no over the top obstacles he has to overcome physically. The biggest one is sorting out his infected tooth. Hanks biggest challenge was acting next to a volleyball named Wilson. The scenes in which he speaks to him could of came off as silly but Hanks is so brilliant that he makes us end up caring for Wilson us much as he does.

Overall, I suggest everyone to watch this film",8
26 April 2006,"Okay, But Nowhere Near The Hype","I remember all the hype this film got prior to its release. Myself, I was disappointed in it but on a second look with lower expectations it was much better. The DVD picture was outstanding: razor sharp and was much more enjoyable to view than at the theater.

I remember a comment or two at church when this film came out, about how it was disappointing that God was never mentioned by Tom Hanks' character in this movie, that anyone in his predicament - stranded on a island for years by himself - would be talking (or even yelling) at God, or praying at one point.

Nonethelesss, Hanks and Hollywood are rarely shown needing or asking help from The Almighty, so they show long scenes of him in his Robinson Crusoe mode, talking to a painted volleyball ""friend"" instead.

That story, however, of Hanks and his island adventures, is much better than the beginning and endings with Helen Hunt, who almost does the wrong thing but, thankfully, does not. I found that last 20-minute scene uncomfortable but maybe we were supposed to feel that way. I just thought they could have come up with a better conclusion post-rescue.

Anyway, most movies in which Hanks stars pretty good, and this is no exception. It's certainly worth a look on DVD.",6

24 September 2013,Remarkable and a story that everyone would want to hear about,"Castaway is one of those classic movies that everyone must see. The plot is uncommon and it was very interesting. Tom Hanks played a great role as Chuck Noland. The fact that he had to face and understand the difference between life in the real world and living in an island with nobody else but a ball named Wilson, made the movie remarkable. Every second is mesmerizing and really made me wonder how scary and difficult it is if I were in Noland's position. This movie also contained love that played a main role to Noland's survival, which makes the audience to feel not as desperate to watch Noland getting lost with the power of love that brought him hope. Also the transition of time as Noland lived his different life being an outcast was really interesting. Not only by appearance, but also mental and behavior. It's a classic the everyone must watch. Tom Hanks played it really well. It also made me question his future fate as the movie goes on, telling about his journey and survival day by day. A very well done movie, it's definitely a story that everyone wants to hear about.

5 June 2002,A kind of modern Robinson Crusoe,"Tom Hanks once again performed very well his acting in this film. He certainly showed how difficult is the life for humans in areas where the so-called civilization did not yet arrive. At this point one should recall all what was taught at primary school to get fire, to feed himself, to sleep and to protect from rain and wind. He could not find any black Friday man as Crusoe did, instead he prepared a ball called Wilson as his only companion. Very strange that in that tropical island there were no mosquitoes or any other insects, at least he was not bothered by this problem, and the whale he found in the sea, was really very ""nice"", funny to see this sequence. What happened to his wife, who thought he died, may also happen to many other wives of soldiers going to war. In fact, she is still in love of his first man, and she married just to forget about him, but not because she was really completely in love of the new husband.

30 April 2009,All You Need is Hanks.,"I once stated that due to Tom Hanks being such a great actor that a film could be made with him being the only character and it would still be great. This film prooves that theory.

Hanks stars as a fedex worker named Chuck. He gets stranded on an island and must survive there, the only possessions he has with him are a few fed ex boxes.

This is a great survival film. Stranded on an island with no help makes for a great conflict that someone can relate to as it could happen to anybody.

Tom Hanks is phenomenal in this film. He really plays a man stranded on an island well. Shows all of the emotions needed; fear, panic, excitement, anger, and determination. I never thought that anyone could make a volleyball seem like a person but this film did that thanks to Hanks great acting. THis really could be his best performance, but he has so many and I think it is safe to say that he is one of the greatest actors who ever lived.

Zemeckis deserves a lot of credit too. THis film obviously had great directing and Zemeckis is a really under rated director in my opinion. Everything seemed perfectly right in this film.

Great conflict and legendary acting. Highly recommended and easily one of Tom Hanks's best films and that says a lot.",10
23 February 2001,One Tediously Super Long FedEx Commercial!,"If you must see this.....rent it....better yet, wait until it comes to HBO or Showtime and save yourself the money. It goes on and on and on for no apparent reason. If I saw the FedEx logo one more time during this ridiculous exploitation, I felt I was going to scream, or at least run from the theatre. Why should I have to pay the same price to see a tediously super long commercial as I do a quality piece of work? It just doesn't seem right. FedEx obviously subsidized the film, they should have subsidized my ticket! And P.S. - Helen Hunt Stunk in this film!

1 May 2011,"In my opinion, the best movie ever made.","This is the movie that defines perfect. Every way I look at it, it's amazing. Now, if you don't think this movie is perfect, erase all of the thoughts you had about this movie before reading this, or else you'll probably disagree with many of the things I say.

This is my favourite film of all time. I love Tom Hanks, I love the location, I love the story, I love the camera-work, I love every aspect. I'll start off with Tom Hanks himself. Well, he sure says a lot without saying much. The emotions on his face are unbelievable realistic. Every breakdown Hank's character has seems real. He can also make the audience emotionally invested in a volleyball, now THAT'S good acting.

The camera-work is astounding. There are many shots that last much longer than the average take in a movie. At first they annoyed me, but now I love them. The pans that can take a minute long really add to the realism, and just lets you take in the situation the main character is in. The effects are pretty good too, sometimes the porta-potty sail looks kinda iffy, but for the most part it's solid. Zemeckis nailed it with how this film was put together, and the camera crew did amazing too.

The story comes off outlandish, but in the end seems realistic. I found that the chances of Noland actually surviving a plane crash and then stumbling upon an unoccupied island slim to none. But hey, at least it's not like Lost, where not only to they crash onto an island, but like 20 or so people survive. I absolutely adore the ending. It shows that the movie will take risks, and that it's willing to vary from the crowd. Some people might say this movie is depressing, but for me, it's a perfect balance. We see a whole bunch of sad and dramatic stuff, so when the happy, funny moments come around it makes them all the more enjoyable.

Finally, I will put all the stupid complaints to rest. A feature length FedEx commercial. Ya, right. Regardless if Zemeckis made a deal with FedEx or not, it makes the movie even more realistic. A real company makes it seem like it really happened or really could happen. Not to mention, why does it bug everyone so much? I didn't even notice how many times the name appears until I read someone complaining about it online. The next thing is the runtime. I'll admit, this movie is a bit long, and is not very convenient. When i saw this for the first time, it bugged me how long the events went on after Chuck is rescued, but now it makes sense to me. More story needed to be told. This wasn't just a survival movie. It's supposed to be more than that. A character study, as we look at the lengths someone will go to stay alive, and the effects that being taken away from civilization for a long time can have on a person and the people around him. And for everything else, you don't like Tom Hanks or the story, that's really just personal preference and I probably won't change your mind on that.

Well, I think Cast Away will always be my favourite movie, and for me, It's a dream come true. My favourite director and my favourite actor come together to make a masterpiece. It's Zemeckis' best movie (Forrest Gump is a close second) and Zemeckis has mastered the art of telling a good story. But, can you please stop with all those CGI movies? It was cool at first, but now it's getting old. Oh well, we've still got his early work, one of the best films ever made, and my favourite film of all time.

14 January 2002,Cure for Insomnia,"'Way too long' is the first thing that comes to mind..

If you're going to have a one-person movie, no matter what else you do, don't let that person be annoying, and boy oh boy, does Tom Hanks annoy me!

From a logistic point of view, I find it incredible he could live that long. It seems impossible, but then again if he died there wouldn't be much of an ending, and what's shocking about that ... Even when he gets back home, HE'S STILL BORING! He's just not a fun guy.

I felt sorry for the volleyball and was glad when he escaped. I would have done a lot to get away from Gilligan..sorry, I mean Tom.

Seriously, there was good cinematography. The island probably would have been paradise if the population were more agreeable.

Now I can see why Russell Crowe won Best Actor for 'Gladiator'. Having seen all the nominees (except Geoffrey Rush) I can honestly say the Academy made a right choice for a change.",3
11 October 2013,One-of-a-kind type of film,"I went to see ""Cast Away"" in the theater during Christmas 2000 because I have a taste for stranded-on-deserted-island movies like ""Mysterious Island"" (1961), but was somewhat disappointed. Why? Possibly because of the fact that Tom Hanks' character in the film, Chuck Noland, is stuck on an island all by his lonesome and the island is very small. As such, there's zero social interaction, except with a soccer ball that chuck names Wilson, and there's very little exploration of the island because it's so small. On top of this, the ending is odd and somewhat ambiguous. Despite this, ""Cast Away"" was a surprise hit at the box office.

Viewing it a second time, I was braced for its uniqueness and got more out of it, but there's still a lot of downtime or empty stretches as Chuck tries to survive for over four years on the island and then faces a completely new life and perspective in the closing act. So don't expect a lot of action or high adventure; this is a drama about the mundaneness of being stuck on a deserted island and how it positively or negatively affects you. There are only a couple of thrilling scenes, like the excellent plane crash.

As noted above, the film respects the intelligence of the viewer by not spelling everything out, but the answers are there for anyone who takes the time to reflect on the events and clues. Some questions the film might provoke: How exactly does a certain Fed-Ex package save Chuck's life? Where's God in all of this? The Texas ranch at the beginning belongs to ""Dick and Bettina"", but at the end to just Bettina, what does this mean? Why the angel symbol of all things? Where does Chuck decide to go at the end?

Like I said, ""Cast Away"" is a one-of-a-kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it. But, when you are, it's very satisfying and even... enlightening.

The film runs 143 minutes.

GRADE: B-/C+",6
25 December 2000,one man show that delivers,"Cast Away is a movie that captures the spirit of one character facing the challenges of nature better than any Jack London story. The enormous risk in making this movie was that it relies, more than any other film I have ever seen, completely on the talent of its star, and realistically I don't see how anyone other than Tom Hanks could have made this work. And work it does; Hanks did a lot more than lose 50 pounds to make this a convincing performance - he reached the very core of the transformation from a human surviving in the information age to one that must survive on primal, animal instinct. He is so convincing that when he loses a completely inanimate object (a volleyball - his only companion throughout the mid-section of the movie), he moves the audience almost to tears. There are a few other characters in the movie, and the supporting performances are well done for what they are worth, but this is Hanks's show from start to finish. 8 out of 10 stars.

15 March 2003,Too manipulative for it's own good.,"`Cast Away' is a less than average film overall and it certainly is nowhere near as good as it set out to be. There are only two stars in the film that are noticed, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.

Tom Hanks does fairly well and you can see that he has prepared for the role, but you can also see that he's not very happy with the material he's been given. Helen Hunt doesn't get enough screen-time, given the plot of the film. She is convincing as usual as a loving housewife but only has one scene in the movie in which she `jumps off' the screen.

`Cast Away' blatantly shouts out `Give me an Oscar'. The material sets out to be gripping and humane but I found it to be hollow on the inside and some of the scenes were unintentionally hilarious. Come on, one man's friendship with his football?????? At 145 minutes `Castaway' is overlong and surprisingly little is covered in that space of time.

The film ends on a question mark and suddenly stops without any satisfying conclusion. Most people, including myself would probably feel cheated out of our money instead of engaged and satisfied. Only the most sentimentally minded audiences wouldn't fall for such blatant manipulation.",
10 July 2007,Hanks can't go wrong,"Before there was ""Lost"" and before there was ""Survivor"", there was ""Cast Away"". ""Cast Away"" is Giligan's Island if Giligan were the only one on it, and if he were Tom Hanks.

There was a t.v. show in the late 80's to early 90's called ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"". They should have called it ""Tom Hanks Can't Lose"" because he is doing everything right. If Tom Hanks' popularity wasn't already astronomical enough, he just served to increase it with his role in this movie. How good of an actor must you be to have nearly an entire movie in which you are the sole focus. He was not the focus of several other characters, he was the focus because he was the only character. This movie, as simple as it was, was brilliant. Hanks did a great job as did the writers and director. Very few movies have mirrored the feat that ""Cast Away"" accomplished.

21 June 2010,Life on a deserted island most certainly not a good time.,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",7
4 April 2009,Interesting Film!,"Cast Away is not a bad movie as some of the negative reviews say. This is certainly not an ad for Fed-Ex. What this movie is is a serious piece of art by acclaimed film maker Robert Zemeckis that stars Tom Hanks.

This film is about Fed-Ex worker, Chuck who gets stranded on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. That happens because his airplane crashed. Now, Chuck has to outwit nature in order to survive and come back home.

The acting is great. The only two well-known actors are Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Hanks did a phenomenal job.

I will admit that some things are incredulous and boring at the least. Some parts are slow especially during the island scenes. The scenes with the volleyball made me think, ""What the heck?"" The thing that gets this movie to work is the odds of surviving on a remote island no one have ever heard of. Overall, this is a basic survival film. I rate this film 8/10.",8
4 August 2018,Awe Inspiring!!!,"I watched this film years ago and the imagery is seared into my memory. The movie is pretty long but worth every minute. Hanks transforms his body in this film to match the situation of his role. It is very challenging for a single person to keep an audience engaged over the duration of the majority of a film, especially a long one. Hanks pulled it off and he makes it seem so effortless.

Hanks carried this film on his back, up a mountain, through a blizzard while being struck by lightening. That is just how awesome he is in this film. The writing is flawless. The location is perfect.

You gotta love the other star in this film, Wilson. Wilson had attitude and played his role well. Wilson took no guff and gave as good as he got. Bravo!

Hanks acting was so on the mark throughout this film, even if you didn't speak English and subtitles were not available, you'd still get the gist of every scene because Hanks was just that good.",9

16 June 2013,Must see survival film,"A film that would be nothing without a powerhouse actor like Tom Hanks. Let's see, this is a film where a single man gets stranded on a deserted island and most of the film's running time is nothing but him talking with himself. No big emotional speeches, barely no action, no real climax - the movie kind of just ends on a mystery, but in a good way - and very little dialogue compared to other recent movies. And it pulls it off, if only barely in certain parts.

Tom Hanks is the saving grace of this film. He is charismatic enough to fill the screen with his presence and is able to convey a lot of themes and emotions without talking, which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. Still, the deserted island part of this film is its weakest. I enjoyed both the beginning and the end a lot more than I did the part where he's just going through the known motions of surviving on a deserted island. Yes, some of that stuff is creative, like the reuse of skates for various tasks, and the ""character"" of Wilson adds a touch of both humour and drama into the scenes. Still, Hanks' character Chuck Noland is an interesting guy and he's opening speech at the beginning of the film easily both sets the character, arouses our interest and gives a lot of room for growth, not all of which gets explored. The island was an important lesson for him, but it was more of a necessary evil, if you ask me.

That being said, it's a strong movie. The film makers went the extra mile to give it nice little finishing touches that lift it above its peers and make it film worth watching. Definitely recommended.",7

26 June 2006,South x South-West Pacific,"I just had the unexpectedly strange and very moving experience of seeing CAST AWAY for the first time with a 39 year old male friend who is deeply traumatized because he is estranged from his pretty blonde wife and gorgeous young children. He lives in a coastal holiday resort; palm trees, hibiscus and mountain cliffs. His complete inability to previously express his agonizing emotional solitude whilst living here (in Australia) in paradise had him descend into sobbing heartbreak throughout in a way I have never previously witnessed. He kept exclaiming to the screen (and Hank's emotive performance and situation) ""This is ME, This is how I am feeling"" and for the first time in many years was able to melt, awash with emotional relief at being able to translate his feelings whilst watching the ordeal in play. It was an astonishing paralyzing experience for me to share with him and it has as of today (today!) allowed him to seek the help and professional guidance with a degree of confidence and heartfelt understanding previously unavailable to him. So I had a double feature! A real life human drama in the room with me, and the film itself! It all added to the experience of having someone alongside who was living CAST AWAY for real in his own heart and head. Maybe if you have a distressed friend unable to break into or out of the emotional knot caused by bereaved family loss, this film will allow a way forward. It worked for us.

any way.....

One has to hand it to Hanks though for a front and center performance that allows every man watching to see his everyman persona on show and apt in every movement and emotion. CAST AWAY is a magnificent looking film, in c/s and on a huge screen it must be astonishing; great plane disaster set pieces and tropical traps, hilarious and heartbreaking Robinson Crusoe level drama and photography and sound design worthy of Oscars. I was queasy about all the FedEx ""ads"" throughout but agreed in the end it was a great device. I especially liked the North By Northwest farm locale seen early and late in the film... and even the positive denouement allowing a realistic life pointer to be an acceptable ending. For a few moments there in the final act, I gripped the seat in apprehension hoping the schmaltz possible wasn't about to really happen. I would watch CAST AWAY again, in fact I want to and will start from the terrifying and spectacular plane crash through the excellent compelling Island sequences and exit with the ocean tanker in the background. CAST AWAY is a uniquely American film success, too long in the last act, and perfectly realized in all the island scenes by the irreplaceable Tom Hanks. I thank you and my pal is today able to move on as well.

Other similar theme movies worth seeing are: ""Man Friday"" (1975) with Peter O'Toole as Crusoe and Richard Roundtree as Man Friday, and the excellent LOST style telemovie made by Universal in 1969 called LOST FLIGHT which stars Anne Francis. (see my comments for that elsewhere).... and of course the best of the lot, the original version of LORD OF THE FLIES (1963).",7
28 May 2011,One of the Greats,"I have a philosophy about people who view a movie in it's own time: Many have great difficulty in appreciating the scope of a truly great movie; for some reason true greatness is only recognized in previous generations, because of how they stand out against their peers.

In my opinion, this movie is truly one of the greatest movies of all time. The story, script, performances, cinematography, and overall production are second to none in every way. Anyone who doesn't appreciate every aspect of this movie is frankly inventing reasons not to like it, just because most people do.

If you are one of the 10 people on earth who haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and download it now. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll ask yourself 'which way does he turn?'.

11 February 2001,Much Ado About Nothing...,"Before seeing the result of a new cooperation between Hanks and Zemeckis I read lots of reviews and praises about this film. My opinion is: It is the ordinary Hollywood mainstream movie targeted at the average America's audience (by the way, in Europe this movie did not score at all).

The first ""let's meet our hero"" part is just terrible. The worst part is about the FedEx guy's visit to Moscow. Hey, Mr. Zemeckis..it is year 2001 now, and you show Russia as it is 20 or 30 years ago. The most ridiculous thing is a lorry stuck in the middle of the Red Square (as far as know, there's no traffic there!) and Tom Hanks ""the savior of under-developed Russians"" paying his employees with bars of Mars and cans of Coke. Hey...this is nominee number 1 for the worst movie of the year!

Then we see Helen Hunt with another non-convincing performance this year (I think her popularity this year is a big mistake of the studios' casting). She tries (without success) to show at least some emotions towards her husband played by Hanks. But it seems like Ms. Hunt read her script just before shooting somewhere in between her other numerous movies, because her acting is not convincing at all.

Then we are supposed to be stunned by crash-scene, after which the ""one-actor"" show begins. I do not think that Tom Hanks is a bad actor, but his level is not high enough to carry the weight if mega-million dollars' movie alone. For sure, this part of the film contains lots of stereotypes about ""a-la Robinson"" situations. For almost one hour we see how Mr.Hanks learns to make a fire, to open the coconut shells, etc, etc. In fact, Discovery Channel would do this part of the movie in a better way.

Then our hero fights with the ocean, loosing his companion, Willson-ball, which was supposed to be a very touching scene. Then our hero is happily home, being saved in the middle of the ocean. His wife is already married, and here it's better to stop the movie, but the director uses the audience's patience for another half-hour, posing some moral questions (finally!) if it is good to ruin new family of his ex-wife.

Overall, the movie is boring with exception of some moments (10% of the movie or so). After leaving the theater I just felt like I left an American-style fast-food, feeling lots of food in my stomach but being unable to recall the taste of food. Same here: expensive movie longer than 2 hours with nothing to recall in couple weeks. Indeed, this year was not good for Hollywood.",6

tom hanks best suit for it...and he carried movie on his shoulders.very well.. his boredom-loneliness-anger-disgust makes us laugh in some scenes...his conversation with football...!!

some shots are shot very well.. climax makes us almost cry... he not only wins against natural calamity odds but also personal life's too...

18 January 2007,"An emotional, uplifting, and positive story of hope, faith, survival and perhaps Divine Intervention.","""Cast Away"" tells the tale of a successful and much revered Federal Express Executive who's dynamic life takes a surreal turn after he is the sole survivor of a horrific plane crash into the ocean. The storyline pits a business savvy workhorse against the wrath of nature in a desperate attempt at survival.

At the core of the movie is a story of hope, survival, love, and faith. The movie explores the personal successes and failures of a white collar, high-powered Executive who's career and many aspects of his personal life are ruled by the clock. An unexpected and traumatic life-altering event removes Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks)from his regimented lifestyle bound by self-erected parameters, and deposits him smack-dab-in-the middle of a new life where he realizes that, ironically, he now has an abundance of his most treasured and precious resource-the resource of time.

""Cast Away"" is an excellent cinematic experience for viewers who have a strong sense of faith, spirituality, and perhaps even divine intervention. Throughout the film, Chuck faces obstacles and scenarios that make ""Survivor"" look like a walk in the park. Everywhere he turns he is seemingly subjected to tests of his mettle and intestinal fortitude. Watching Chuck navigate each experience, the viewer cannot help but explore his/her own circumstances and wonder if they have what it truly takes to survive if they were left to their own devices. Notwithstanding the physical challenges, one must ask themselves if he/she could overcome the emotional and psychological challenges.

Perhaps most importantly, I believe the premise of the movie is that you are only bound by your own parameters. You can survive just about any situation if you look deep down inside your core and pull out reserves you never knew you had. It also seems to teach you that you should never give up. However, if the situation is too much to handle and you have done your absolute best to survive, you may just get a little help from a divine source.

Powerful, emotional, gripping, exciting! Highly recommended!",9
6 March 2019,Speechless,"What an amazing performance, by Tom Hanks, who takes the viewer to a remote island. Hanks is able to portray a character that gets broken down, and rebuilds himself.

With hardly a set, hardly a supporting cast, a minimum of dialogue and expressions, but with a hurricane of emotions, a credible and breathtaking Hanks keeps the audience at the edge of their seats from the beginning till the end, in this masterpiece of a movie.

13 March 2020,Just a wonderful movie,"If you don't tear up by the end you may check to see if you have a working heart. This is just an amazing journey. So many emotions. It's about survival, love had, love lost.

I don't want to go over what most others already pointed out. You just need to watch it and patiently wait until the end as it carefully wraps up the amazing journey. My only criticism, which is small, is that they didn't need the very last scene, as it had already wrapped up. It would have been more powerful without him finding ""new love.""

Robert Zemeckis is a gem of a director.

7 April 2021,Robinson Tom Hanks(o),"I have to admit my summary line would have worked even better if it wasn't Tom Hanks but Tom Cruise in the main role here ... that funny anecdote aside, the movie is quite the tour de force. But as every good story you'll have to wait until the island story begins. When it begins though, there is quite the hard story to go through.

You may start thinking: What would I do in a situation like that? Apart from maybe not working for Fed Ex (or any other postal service company, which I reckon you can make as much fun of as you want - for good reasons), you probably would have quite a few issues. Or maybe not - I know that while survival instincts would kick in ... I'd have quite the trouble. And Hanks character does too ... we see how he has to learn so many things ... or to live without so many things. Most of us are used to a safe place, electricity and so many more things that make our lifes easier ... nowadays even more so than back then ... cell phones have made us ... quite dependent on them.

And with no possibility to charge them ... we probably would have major issues to determine or find out how to do things that should be common sense ... The movie does a good job and Hanks has quite the powerhouse performance ... and that almost without anyone by his side (yes Friday will not make an appearance in this ... native inhabitants have been made expandable one might say) ... not everyones cup of tea, but really well made.",8
31 July 2014,Tom Hanks is Incredible,"At the time of its release, this was Tom Hanks best effort yet. As he appears in nearly every frame, the film relies heavily on his screen presence and acting. Amazingly he pulls it off with considerable ease. I loved the narration and the way it was filmed, especially on the island. When it comes to realism, the plane crash was one of the best I've ever seen in any movie.

In western society we come to expect so many everyday comforts as the norm and living without them is both disconcerting and frustrating. The central character's daily frustrations and loneliness are well presented and we all felt great empathy with him throughout. Plus, having audience members nearly in tears over a basketball is no mean feat, but that's what happened. Everything worked well and the story was rewarding in so many ways, especially towards the end. I found this film difficult to fault, incredibly enjoyable and would recommend it to all without reservation.

15 November 2003,one...,"After he tackled (with panache) the fantastic cinema with ""What lies Beneath"" (2000), Robert Zemeckis decided to shot an adventure movie. The result was ""Cast Away"", a simple and bald movie. This film is also the occasion for reunion between Zemeckis and Tom Hanks.

After ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), Hanks puts himself in Chuck Noland's shoes who is all the contrary of Forrest Gump. He's a man who lives an unrestrained life a bit all over the world. But one day, his life's tumbling down. Indeed, following a plane crash, he finds himself on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific ocean. Now, he must get organized...

Robert Zemeckis' movie is in itself a respectable achievement. It's especially worth for Hanks' awesome performance. He's all alone in front of the camera for a very important part of the movie but he got out very well of this difficulty. Then, dialogs are rare, music is nearly absent but Zemeckis managed in holding the spectator's attention for all the movie. Moreover, he knows what he's doing and in spite of the length of the movie, you don't get bored.

""Cast away"" is a movie that even exudes a certain humor. You have to see Tom Hanks's face and behavior in front of his new (and embarrassing) situation on the island.

This movie is a little masterstroke and ranks among Zemeckis' best movies.",

13 September 2010,Master-Class!,"'Cast Away' is not an easy film to watch. A man stuck in an abandoned Island and his loneliness can be very off-putting. But when a subject like this is handled by Hollywood Legends like Robert Zemeckis & Tom Hanks, you know that something great is in store.

'Cast Away' is not the greatest film of all-time nor is it the best film of the year it released. But it's an extra-ordinary film, that is hopeful by nature. About 142 minutes long, 'Cast Away' is not about an isolated man, it's not about his sadness, but about love & hope. 'Cast Away' is film that has it's heart, mind and soul in the right place.

Robert Zemeckis has gone down as one of Hollywood's most talented filmmakers ever. His body of work is impeccable and a true legend. 'Cast Away' is amongst his strongest and fittest efforts to date. William Broyles Jr.'s Screenplay is wonderful, with memorable dialogue. Cinematography by Don Burgess's captures each moment effortlessly.

In the acting department, Tom Hanks is outstanding. He is the most successful actor, box office wise, and as an actor, he easily ranks amongst the best in his dictionary. Helen Hunt is excellent, as well. Chris Noth also, is very effective.

On the whole, Such Films Come Very, Very Rarely! A awe-struck, Two Thumbs Up!",10

25 February 2006,"Slow beginning, then pretty good","The first 45 minutes of the show establishes the Chuck Noland character played by Tom Hanks as a high-strung Fedex foreman. It could have been done in 5 minutes. Then Chuck is on a plane and it crashes at sea and he washes ashore on an island all to himself. This part is great as we see the clever things he does to get by. Then comes the very weak last half hour of the film. I won't say what happened but it was a snore.

I'm not a big Hanks fan but he's OK here. Interesting also that he really got in shape for this film. For the first month or so on the island he's your typical flabby American. Then after a while he truly slims down and looks like a flat-belly teenager.

As others have commented, this movie almost plays as a Fedex commercial. Really tacky.

30 December 2003,Slow but engaging drama that is driven by Hanks' brave performance,"Chuck Noland is a driven employee of Fed-Ex. He has a loving girlfriend and a lifestyle that sees him travelling the world. When he takes an overnight flight across the Pacific, his plane crashes killing the crew but he escapes on an inflatable dingy. Washing up on an island Chuck finds himself shipwrecked and must survive until he is found.

I wasn't won over by the idea of this film when it came out at the cinema and gave it a miss. However on TV I'm graceful enough to give anything a chance for free! In this case I had no hype or bad reviews about the film to colour what I thought of it, coming to it fresh enough to have an open mind. Fortunately I was in a patient mood and looking forward to seeing it, so it didn't bother me that the film was very slow, although I can understand why some audiences were straining at the leash for more pace. For me the story itself was interesting enough as a human story to defy `things happening' - it was Chuck I was watching the film for, not a fight scene or a dramatic rescue.

For this reason the film succeeds - to me it was dramatic and engaging on a character level and, because things were always happening to Chuck, I didn't need some constant bit of plot to be happening. The film is quite brave in that way and, while other reviewers have criticised the ending, I thought it displayed good taste and control - imagine trying to get that ending through a pitch or a preview audience! Most films would have looked for a more positive and conclusive ending - but this one was very good.

Hanks does great work to hold the attention for the whole film - he is barely off screen for a minute of the whole 120+ minutes. His performance is good; whether he is acting normal or talking to a volley ball he is convincing and never dull, he makes it very easy for us to get into his character and his situation - which was vital to keep the audience interested.

Overall I really enjoyed this film but I do feel you need to be ready for what you're sitting down to. It is slow paced and, if you're impatient, then you may feel like `nothing's happening'. Hanks does great to hold the audience otherwise and the film is grown up and lacking in the sort of syrupy smaltz that could have killed the film. Not perfect but an great story well told if you're in a patient mood.",
7 September 2022,A volleyball made me cry,"""I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly. But I'm so grateful that she wasn't with me on that island. And I know what I have to do now. I gotta keep breathing. Because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?""

Let me ask you a simple question, what makes a survival story click? A deserted place with no signs of civilization in the vicinity? Exhibition of some of the most drastic weather conditions? An effective central protagonist? To whom we could relate? For whom we could show some empathy? With 'Cast Away', Zemeckis seemed to have ticked all the requisites! A beautiful, beautiful movie with a wonderful message that propagates the true value of everything around us, including our very existence.

To be honest, It's quite difficult to put my exact thoughts into words right at this moment, since I am pretty overwhelmed by emotions. I cannot stress enough how much of an impact it had on my mind and my conscience! Even though I have always had the utmost respect for such survival tales and the people involved in them, who against all odds, have never given up on their hopes and their will to live another day.

Still, never would have I imagined that I would be moved to tears, that I would lose control over my feelings, that a darn volleyball would make me feel devastated; this was something else! I have yet to witness a lot from Zemeckis (including Forrest Gump), but following my time with Back to the Future Trilogy and now this movie; one thing I can bet on is that this guy knows his craft, he knows how to create lasting characters, and make people fall in love with them! Filmmakers of this day and age should take a lesson or two I reckon.",9
25 October 2018,"A movie classic called Cast Away, not Castaway","Cast Away is about a Fed Ex executive who is involved in a plane crash and has to survive on a deserted island. From that description you might think this is a rather mundane movie with no plot and no story. It could not be further from the truth.

This, simply put, is a movie about time. It is a movie about the emotions that time evokes on any ordinary human being. You feel like you are in the movie and can relate to the characters and the story. Whether is it the deserted island, the romance, or the job you feel like Tom Hanks character, Chuck Noland.

The one aspect of director Robert Zemeckis films that I think are perfect are how he uses metaphor to tell the story. In this film, there is a beginning and an end. And they are both perfect and complement one another. It is hard to believe that a film can make the viewer relate to such a long period of time in 2 and a half hours. But Zemeckis does it with this movie just like he did it with an earlier classic called Forrest Gump.

There was one other aspect of this film that I realized myself and I wonder if others did too? If you type into a search for this film the word, Castaway, you will not find it. That is because the name of this film is actually Cast Away with a space. And to myself the meaning between the two titles is totally different. I think the hidden meaning is this: This is NOT a film about a castaway on a deserted island(like so many people think). It is a film about a guy, through some unavoidable event in his life, who is cast away by time and has to find himself all over again. The beginning and the end of this film made this point beautifully. This is a movie classic.",10

29 September 2014,Hanks is Revelatory in His Beach-Stranded One Man Show,"There's really a whole lot more to this than just Tom Hanks alone on an island. It works on a visceral level as a straightforward tale of survival amidst the harshest conditions imaginable, but underneath the surface there's all manner of allegorical goodness also at play. It's intense and powerful no matter how you choose to take it, though, and that's the sign of a real masterwork. That whole stack of cards teeters on Hanks's work in the central role, of course, and he flat-out crushes it. In a way, his whole career up to this point has been preparing him for this kind of an effort; I can see shreds of many of his earlier roles, alive in his gamut of expressions, as he slowly, grimly comes to terms with the fact that there's no form of rescue on the horizon. He's familiar but lost, a modern-day everyman denied his tool belt, stripped bare to the very core of his being. It's an all-world performance, easily among the best of his career, though it didn't quite draw the accolades that his turns in Philadelphia or Forrest Gump enjoyed. Behind the lens, Robert Zemeckis also hands in some of his best work. Experimenting with before-their-time camera angles and quick, effective snapshots of daily life on the island, he's able to evolve his craft without losing touch with his typically warm, lush brand of storytelling. And, needless to say, Cast Away's famous crash scene remains one of film's most historically intense, white-knuckle rides. I didn't realize I'd been holding my breath until it was all over. A fantastic picture that only stumbles in the payoff, lingering in the moment for longer than it really should, then momentarily giving in to its indulgent, romantic side.",9

He finally escapes when Forrest falls asleep on the raft they use to get off the island. He would rather take his chances drifting alone at sea than spend another second with Mr. Gump. Can't really blame him. I'd do the same. Just kidding. Pretty good good movie. Little slow though. Could have used a car chase or maybe couple of gun battles to liven things up. Just saying....

5 January 2021,Tom Hanks Never Disappoints,"I loved every bit of the film. The movie brings to life the thought of ""What would I do if I was stranded on an island?"" Tom Hanks acting was amazing as he brought life to his character Chuck who is trying to survive with what little he has on an island alone. The dedication he gave to his role with the drastic change in his physical weight was crazy and the emotional change he brought to his character as he goes from a sane man to almost losing it, then humbled was four stars. The filming was amazing with the beach and water scenes, the CGI with the plane was a little lower budget, as it would have been better with real props. It's entertaining to watch Chuck survive on the island as it's real and down to earth, nothing he does has you saying, ""there's no way, that's impossible."" Instead the movie is extremely practical, which makes it enjoyable. The only downfall is how the end drags out a little, mixed with bitter sweet feelings. But still a great film.

8 January 2001,The last act makes this a disappointment,"I remember the day I was going to see this film what I was thinking to myself. I was driving to wherever, and I began to wonder how Hanks was going to get rescued. It would probably be by a plane going overhead or he was going to make an attempt to sail off the island in some crude contraption of a boat and then be rescued by some ocean tanker that transports cars from Tokyo to Nova Scotia. I then began to think of what expression I would have if I was the extra in the film that had the thankless non speaking role of the guy that sees Hanks first. Would my eyes bulge from their forehead? Would I look like I had just seen a ghost? Would I just stare in awe as the tiny boat floated by and was dwarfed by the tanker that I was on? Would I be smoking a cigarette and it would just stick to my bottom lip as my mouth became agape? These are all tough choices to make for an extra with such a vital role in the film. Which one of these reactions actually happened in the film? Well if you have seen the film, you know exactly what happened and if you haven't then you'll just have to read a little further to find out. But just saffice it to say that it is issues like this one that made the film a 7 for me and not the 9.5 that it should have been. And that is a shame.

Cast Away is a very good film, it's just that it could have been one of the best if only they would have put a little more care into it. Even though the film is a good 2 and half hours, it deserved to be three. When you go to great pains to have a story of this magnitude then why can you not close the deal and make the last act just as good as the middle one?

What is good about the film is the first act and what is even better is the second one. We are introduced to Hanks as a guy that lives and dies by his watch. He is always timing everything and he is so busy that he has to schedule in his girlfriend for New Year's. It is a promise, he guarantees her that he will be home for this festive time of year. So far Hanks's character, while a little intricate and obsessive, seems like many of us. We all live by the clock in one way or another. It's just that he is a little more serious about it. But in these times that we live in, we are all bound by deadlines, we are all aware of the time and we are all a little obsessive about our jobs at one time or another. So again, we can relate to his character quite well. Of course that all changes when the plane that he is on crashes in the middle of the ocean somewhere. Hanks uses a raft to drift for days and he comes up on a deserted, almost uncharted island in the middle of nowhere. It is here that the strength of the film is presented. And this is the most amazing thing about the film. We are not only entertained with Hanks on an island by himself, but we want more. We are captivated. At least I was. The film moves slowly at times when he is here but it also captures the feeling of isolation, loneliness, despair, hope and a plethora of other feelings in between. Hanks does an incredible job of conveying these emotions inspite of the fact that he is the only thing on screen. He has no one to talk to so he finds an inanimate object and gives it life. It's name is Wilson, a volleyball that has washed up on shore that Hanks breathes life into. Wilson becomes a great character and when it is in danger at times, it frightened me and saddened me that it was. I have not experienced an array of emotions the way I did when he was on the island. And as much as I wanted to see Hanks get off the island, I was completely engulfed in his time there. When he eventually did get off, I craved for him to be back on that tiny island, with Wilson, his coconuts, his caves, his fire and all else that was there. Up until his rescue ( and you knew that was inevitable, from the trailers ), this was easily one of the five best films of the year. But what it did once he got rescued was very weak and very poor. There was so much more that they could have done. There never was that reaction shot of the guy on the ocean liner that first sees him. There was never really any reaction to him getting rescued. It just happened. I wanted to see everyone's faces and expressions when this man that has been lost for 4 years come home. But not once did we get that. And that is what I meant when I said that this films should have been 3 hours long, hell it could have been 3 and a half, that would have given us closure and maybe a little more honesty. As it stands, it is a good film, but with the combined talents of Zemekis and Hanks, it could have been so much more. And that makes it disappointing.

7 out of 10- Still a good film and a fantastic journey, but it lacked once he got off the island. However, Hanks should be nominated for best actor and if he wins, there should be no complaints. It is an incredible performance. This film is worth seeing but it also worth noting that there are quite a few better films out there so far this year.",7
25 January 2009,Excellent movie,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",10
2 July 2001,"""WILSON????!!!!????""","This movie is so ridiculous, I am going to have a really hard time making fun of it. All I have to say is that five minutes in, my friends and I were taking a sip anytime the (enter name of delivery company that rhymes with ""Red Rex"") logo is onscreen. That was the prologue.

This movie *NEVER ENDS*. The prologue alone is about five hours long. But finally the plot kicks in and things pick up for a while.

Tom Hanks washes up on the island. He wanders around for days and days. When he isn't wandering around, he yells at the animals in the forest to be quiet. They don't listen to him.

And then, when things couldn't get more crazy, when I couldn't be laughing my rear end off any harder, we meet Wilson.

Wilson is the most interesting character in the movie. All told, he has more screen time than Helen Hunt's character but not as much as the ""Red Rex"" logo.

You want to see Tom Hanks looking like a Neanderthal and getting into heated arguments with a volleyball? Here's your movie.

You want to roll around on the floor laughing at Tom Hanks looking like a Neanderthal and getting into heated arguments with a volleyball? Let me just say (since that was the same spirit I saw it in) that it is going to take one heck of a movie to beat this one.",4

A Mr everybody gets into a situation no one would ever want to endure. Not much dialogue, not a lot of action, but a story of human spirit and survival. Tom Hanks, I praise you as the Jimmy Stewart of our time. C No land.

Just wanted to say the ending never leaves me dry eyed. And a line from the film has always got me through difficult times. ""I know what I've got to do. I've got to keep breathing. Because tomorrow the sun will come up and you never know what the tide might bring in."" This is a fantastic film about never giving up.

24 April 2021,One of greatest movie I have ever watched,"First time I watched Cast Away, I'm loo little. But I can memories ""I'm sorry Wilson, I'm sorry"" moment. I'm Tom Hanks fan since watch this movie. Cast Away is a great story. This is the best cinematic example of what it feels like to be truly alone.

Finally I have a big question, what was in the box with the angel wings, and why didn't he open it?

7 January 2004,"""See our cast away, here on Gilligan's Isle...""","CAST AWAY has an interesting start. Tom Hanks can carry a romantic drama. But this movie is not a romantic drama.

Soon there is a jumbo jet plane crash in the Pacific Ocean. The crash as depicted would truly splinter the aircraft and kill all, but anyway Tom survives. Not only is he fully conscious and makes it to the surface of the water, but a lone jet engine remains high above water during the crash and begins to chase after Tom. Tom escapes.

There is a special effects problem here. When Tom first makes it to the surface and while he is being chased by the jet engine, the ocean has small white caps. But then after Tom escapes from the jet engine, the ocean instantly has giant swells. First the ocean waves are too small to reach the bottom of the jet engine, then next they are three times bigger than the engine. There is no continuity.

Tom washes up on the shore of a small tropical island. On the wide screen it might be fine, but on TV there is never a single shot showing the whole island. The movie is spent on a beach always facing in the same direction. There is a strong sense that the ""island"" is only 180 degrees, and not 360 degrees around.

To be honest, if I were lost on a small tropical island, I know I would starve to death within a couple of weeks. Still, any person would do their best to try to survive. There are some obvious things any person would do.

A person would make a home base at a dry shaded location high enough to be far from big storm waves. A person would take stock of everything they had. All man made items would be saved as being rare and precious.

In CAST AWAY, Tom Hanks digs a hole and puts the dead pilot inside with all of his cloths on, and then covers him.

In real life, most anyone would take the cloths off of the pilot and keep them because the clothing has high value. Also, most men I think would use pieces of the dead pilot's body as bait for fishing.

In CAST AWAY, Tom completely wastes the batteries to his only flashlight, and in general he acts like his ""frantic guy"" character from his MONEY PIT movie. Too often, Tom is in ""frantic guy"" mode but it is not funny enough to be a comedy.

The island portion of CAST AWAY does not ring true to life. The unrealistic aspects make this movie very difficult to enjoy.",2
2 March 2007,Cast Away glows in retrospective as a chilling drama that foreshadowed things to come,"With little words and many emotions, Tom Hanks prevails in Cast Away as the sole survivor of a plane crash who is forced to learn to live alone on a deserted island, with a football he calls Wilson being his only companion. Four years before Lost saw the light of day and one year before 9-11, Cast Away glows in retrospective as a chilling drama that foreshadowed things to come. However, the fact the film is followed with an optimistic note and has some truly moving sequences, gives us all hope there might still be a light at the end of the tunnel. Kudos also goes to director Robert Zemeckis who managed to turn this one-man-mission into a moving journey of faith and hope.

6 October 2012,Wiiillllssssonnnn!!!!...,"I found this a totally absorbing film; one of those that make the time pass much more quickly than you expect. You very quickly get involved in the story and you find that you actually care about this man stranded on this island. You really want him to survive and get back to the woman he loves; and you feel his pain when things don't go quite right. It's quite emotional and can be quite harrowing in places. Some people don't like the ending but I really did; it leaves the audience to decide just what he'll do next Loved this one.

SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

My score: 9.2/10

1 January 2001,Great human drama!,"Tom Hanks plays a FedEx executive that survives a plane crash in the ocean and drifts upon an uninhabited island. He is finally given up for dead as he spends more than four years on the island. There are some moments of humor mixed with the sullen sadness of solitude. The human spirit is fortified by positive attitude and determination.

Hanks, being the skilled actor he is, makes you feel his pain and sense of fulfillment. Mother nature fills the bill as special effects. This is a wonderful movie to watch. Another masterpiece for director Robert Zemeckis.

Also starring are Helen Hunt, Lari White, Nick Searcy and Christopher Noth.

7 January 2001,"The Decline and Fall of ""Cast Away""","""Cast Away"" has a brilliant performance from Tom Hanks, solid direction from Robert Zemeckis, and an intriguing plot from writer William Broyles. The film quickly grows out of slow beginning to build to the fantastic island sequence, which leaves the audience hungry for the final climax. Yet ""Cast Away"" squanders all these advantages and crashes in the last act. Why did a movie with such potential self-destruct? Some points:

1) Turning the film into a two hour FedEx commercial was disgraceful and unnecessary. The family is eating Christmas dinner, and what do they talk about: FedEx! Hanks and a friend are flying in a plane, and what do they talk about: FedEx! Who greets Hanks upon his return to civilization: the president of FedEx! The story would have been much better served with a fictional shipping company, which would have preserved key aspects of Hanks character but not insulted the intelligence of the audience. People paid to see a movie, not a FedEx commercial.

2) The studio ad campaign, which made a super human effort to give away the ending of the film. I don't know who was responsible for the second trailer, but I would advise studios not to hire them.

3) A poor screenplay from Broyles, who came up with a good idea but lacked the talent too properly execute it. Top on the list is the failure of Tom Hanks' character to undergo any kind of change or growth: after suffering through a life altering adventure, he emerges as the exact same man as when he started. He remains optimistic and cheerful, never displaying any anger or bitterness. You would think that a man who was stranded on an island for four years and lost the love of his life would be at least a little upset or depressed. And after spending these four years alone, living in the most primitive conditions, he needs no time to adjust to modern civilization, except that he doesn't like sleeping in his bed. He also feels a need to apologize to everyone he meets for being marooned the island, something akin to apologizing for being hit by a drunk driver. And the final scene with Helen Hunt looks more like it was written for a romantic comedy; in fact, that argument could be made for the entire final act, which is filled with site gags.

4) Casting Helen Hunt. What a waste of talent. She receives no billing (justifiably, see this is Tom Hanks' movie from beginning to end) and has a relatively small role. Better for Hunt to devote her considerable abilities to a worthier project, and for Zemeckis to cast a less well known, up and coming actress that might surprise the audience.

""Cast Away"" is a movie in three parts: a decent (but slow moving) opener, a fantastic middle, and a disastrous end. It's a movie that could have (and should have) been better. On a scale of 1-10, with 5 being average and 10 being a masterpiece, I am forced to give ""Cast Away"" a 5, making ""Cast Away"" a discount theater or rental movie.",5
11 March 2001,A waste of film,"At the end of this film and found myself just saying 'why', why would anyone bother to make this film. It didn't appear to cover any new ground; it wasn't a true story, so seemed rather pointless.

The acting was fine, and some of the cinematography was good, but there were some basic errors. The whale scene was poor; the scene in Moscow was a joke. If anyone has visited Red Square, it's behind a number of pedestrian areas and although, in special circumstance, can be access via road, why would you. Oh, because, to show you're in Russia you have to have the backdrop of Red square. The scene in question was impossible, so I assume it was computer generated. The cliché scene with Helen Hunt was so Hollywood' it was a bit sad. Not to mention that she didn't waste too much time getting married and having kids, he was only gone just over 4 years.

Overall, I didn't hate the film, it was a bit boring, but I just could see why anyone would be interested in such a poor, uninteresting story.",3
12 September 2001,Life is full of the choices we make...,"Although this movie is one of those ""love it or hate it"" movies, it still proves to be captivating and breathtaking. First and foremost, Tom Hanks is once again brilliant, and should have won Best Actor. Second, he and Zemeckis once again pair up for a brilliant director-actor tandem. I love the way Zemeckis pays attention to particular details (i.e. the ocean, the night sky, like in ""Contact""). I also think the end of this movie is unbelievable. I'm kind of gullible and I usually don't get hidden messages, but this one was loud and clear: he reaches a crossroads in his life, and can do whatever he wants. The two best parts of this movie are the ending and the music, majestically conducted by Alan Silvestri, who typically works with Zemeckis. The music is beautiful and accentuates the action of the movie. This may be the ""Tom Hanks Show"" for a good solid 2 hours, but it still conveys a powerful message: people may love, and lose, but they are still free to make independent choices.

13 March 2001,"Good performance by Tom Hanks, good sequences on the deserted island, but the movie really only succeeds by a margin. *** (out of four)","CAST AWAY / (2000) *** (out of four)

By Blake French:

(this comment on ""Cast Away"" does contain material of a spoiling nature).

""Cast Away"" starts on a fairly entertaining note, but devolves into a contrived love story and becomes buried in tedious sequences in which its characters have nothing to do. The main character spends most of the movie's dreadfully long running time alone on a desolate island-but we determined from trailers and TV ads that the character is retrieved after four years, which kind of eliminates the tension of whether or not he will get off the island alive.

Tom Hanks plays Nick Noland, a systems engineer for Federal Express who intends to wed his long time girlfriend, Kelley (Helen Hunt), after he returns from a business trip over the south Pacific. We are not surprised when his plane encounters a horrible storm. During one of the most intensely convincing crash sequences ever made, the aircraft plummets into the ocean below, miles off course. Nick is the sole survivor, finding a resting place on a deserted tropical island. Time passes, he builds shelter, losses hope, but nonetheless survives. If you are not aware of his eventual rescue after four years, then you are not among the movies target audience. The story really focuses on Nick starting his life over and overcoming extreme odds. He finds out that Kelley became married and the rest of society has assumed his death. Nick's determination is encouraging, but the movie needs more detailing survival on the island. The scenes on the island are the movies best. The film is very careful not to become idle. There are constantly new situations and conflicts being introduced, even though their scenes are often slow moving and tedious.

Tom Hanks does an exceptional job as the only real character in the film, all other's are plot devices. There are a few attempts to introduce side characters, but in a movie like this that is nearly impossible, although the actors do a reasonable job with what little screen time they behold.

Director Robert Zemekis stays focused on a consistent narrative instead of going back and forth between characters, like the mediocre ""Six Days, Seven Nights."" This is a thought-provoking situation, but most of us already know how the plot concludes. The actual conclusion itself is actually dissatisfying and inconclusive. ""Cast Away"" is still a good production, well made, and beautifully crafted. I liked the directors consistent style and focused narrative, the plane crash sequence, and I give the film a marginal recommendation.",7
29 October 2011,Worthwhile for Hanks's performance,"Filmmaker Robert Zemeckis has stylishly and artistically made an impact on pop culture with his unique movies. Cast Away is one of those films that made an impact of cultural substance. Tom Hanks gives a great performance as the central character and only Hanks could make him so likable. Hanks's strong, moving performance keeps us from losing attention in the story, however preposterous it may be. The movie is overlong and flawed, but it has great moments of seriocomedy and melodrama. Zemeckis does manage to give us insights into isolation and half-insanity with masterful results. Hanks fans should love it, despite all the flaws in realism that Zemeckis does mange to redeem through his solid storytelling.

13 June 2007,DIY: Survive,"Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a top Fed-Ex manager, is a workaholic whose life is controlled by the clock. When Chuck accepts a last-minute job that interrupts his Christmas, he parts from his love, Kelly (Helen Hunt), to board a plane which ultimately crashes into the Pacific. Chuck is the only survivor of this crash and is washed onto a deserted island. With only intuition and a few recovered packages, Chuck must learn to survive. His love for Kelly is the only thing which pulls him through this time, but when he is rescued four years later, he returns to civilization only to find that Kelly has moved on. With the love of his life taken away, he must now overcome his most difficult challenge: life without love.

In the film ""Cast Away"" (2000) director Robert Zemeckis depicts a great adventure of the hardships and tragedies that one man must face for survival. Zemeckis accomplishes a great feat through this movie. For over half of the 143-minute film, Tom Hanks performs with only a volleyball, ""Wilson,"" and somehow the film never ceases to entertain the audience. Aside from this achievement, Zemeckis successfully portrays his central idea of loss and return and the tragedies that accompany this. His idea is effectively depicted through Chuck's mood changes from desperation to optimism, from passive despair to aggressive hopefulness. In the end, his return is accompanied by the painful realization that he has been gone too long. The central message delivered to the audience is to appreciate life because it can change at any moment.

Zemeckis's intentions are also illustrated through sophisticated techniques. The most appealing technique of this film is its ability to attract both genders: females are attracted to Noland's motive for survival, and males are attracted to his techniques for survival. Camera techniques are also very important in this movie's appeal. The camera does not conceal imperfections; it actually strives to capture the unattractive moments to portray true ruggedness. To show Noland's frantic mentality, the camera moves quickly and restlessly. Another compelling technique is Hank's physical transformation. The production of ""Cast Away"" was halted for a year while Tom Hanks dieted to achieve his starved appearance. This along with the other techniques utilized make this film both compelling and entertaining to a wide variety of viewers.",9
17 May 2009,What a Magnificent Adventure!,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away.

1 April 2009,This movie couldn't be more dramatic..!!,"Cast Away is a 2000 film starring Tom Hanks. Hanks portrays a FedEx employee who is stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes on a flight over the South Pacific. The film depicts his attempts to survive on the island using remnants of his plane's cargo, as well as his eventual escape and return to society. A very well executed story. This is a silent movie obviously A guy won't speak to himself in a lost island. Its about his survival and his battle with nature. This movie couldn't be more dramatic. A very calm and incredible movie, which will take you to a completely different journey to an island. The authenticity and Outstanding plot was enough to made me attract towards such a movie. In terms of acting Tom hanks did an awesome job. No wonder he got nominated as the best actor. This volleyball part was very innovative. Wilson is the name given to the volleyball which plays the role of a mute, infinitely patient, non-living listener in the movie, providing Chuck with a companion for the 1,500 days he spends on the island. Overall a must see flick which is a hell of a ride. I will give it 8 ratings out of 10

During Christmas dinner with his family, he gets a call to catch a plane for work. Something goes wrong with the plane on his way and it crashes into the ocean. The rest of the film shows how he tries to survive on the island he ends up on and him living without the love of his life, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt).

One of the major themes of the movie is survival. Chuck makes the most out of what he has to fend for himself and keep himself alive for the amount of time he is on the island. He makes a bow and arrow type of thing out of sticks to catch fish and crabs to eat, he made a fire with sticks to keep himself warm and to cook his food, and he used the blow up boat from the plane as shelter.

The camera crew did an amazing job showing Chuck's will to survive through the camera work. They used aerial shots to show how alone he was, close up shots to show the emotions he felt, and cut to shots during his conversations with Wilson to show that the volleyball was the only ""friend"" he had on the island.

Tom Hanks' portrayal of Chuck Noland is one of the best on- screen performances, in my opinion. He did an amazing job showing the desperation Chuck felt while he was alone on this island struggling to survive.",10
17 January 2001,"This movie,...SUCKS.","Okay,...let me start with the POSITIVES--

I liked the plane crash. I mean,...that was good,...but the second he got on dry land, I found myself wishing that he'd drowned along with the plane. Tom Hanks is a BEAST. It's not JUST the pathetic acting that made me hate this movie,...it's the script. This movie had the potential to be really interesting and profound...but then just as Hanks' character starts to settle in on the island, there's a blackout and suddenly the screen says: ""4 Years Later"".

Um,...FOUR YEARS LATER??? Then,...why the hell did I come to see this movie??? So that I could see him reunite with rat-face Helen Hunt. Um,...okkaaayyy. Except that the reunion between the two is PATHETIC. The scriptwriters tried to pack the ENTIRE process of shock, grieving, reignited love, and realization that each of them had ""moved on"" into TEN MINUTES.

What a load.

The ending is so cheesy it hurt. And the imagery throughout the film is so blatant that it's insulting.

They just skipped over EVERY SINGLE SCENE that I was interested in seeing.

This movie's a STEAMER.",1
26 September 2001,The Ultimate Survivor,"Although ""Cast Away"" is effectively a 143 minute commercial for Fed Ex, it is nonetheless a good movie. In the midst of the many ""reality based"" TV shows, Director Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks give us a feeling of what it would really be like to have to survive in the wilderness.

Hanks plays Chuck Noland a troubleshooter for Fed Ex whose plane goes down somewhere over the Pacific Ocean during a raging storm. He somehow survives and washes up on the beach of a deserted island. He is forced to learn how to survive by using the materials and resources that are available to him in this wilderness.

Zemeckis and Hanks through his stunning performance, are able to convey the loneliness and isolation of an everyman in a seemingly hopeless situation. We see the Hanks character grow his hair and beard, lose weight (which he actually did for the film) and form a touching ""friendship"" with a volleyball onto which he has drawn a face and calls ""Wilson"", to keep from going mad. He also longs for the girl he left behind (Helen Hunt) by constantly looking at a picture of her in the watch that she had given him.

Hanks is outstanding in the lead role and Hunt does what she can in a limited role. Watch for Chris Noth in small part.

I thought the producers went a little too far though in their Fed-Ex tie-in. I mean, we see Fed-Ex trucks and packages all through the picture and yes, even on the desert island. Oh my god, I think they got me too. How many times have I mentioned ""Fed-Ex"" in MY comments?",8

Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs.

26 April 2011,Cast Away,"CAST AWAY – 9.3/10

Director: Robert Zemeckis

Writer: William Broyles Jr.

The greatness of a film is normally traced to the director; there are no two ways about that. We seldom know who the writer is and are even less curious as to who it might be. Cast Away is a case-in-point; it made me shout half way through the film – ""who the hell wrote this"" ? One of the finest stories of the 21st century, there is much more this film talks about than what it was given credit for. The director, Robert Zemeckis (Forest Gump fame) needless to say has done a brilliant job, but what needs serious mention is the writer – William Broyles Jr.

The writer marooned himself for a week on an island to understand what people do in survival situations and consulted several survival experts. Cast Away deals with the very basics of human life; it pokes the viewer with questions we never ask ourselves. Or maybe the need to ask these questions never arise - Why are we here? The film has a strong existential undertone and Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee marooned on an island after a plane crash, has given one of the finest performances of his career. The film deals with the struggle of a man who must survive, for the sake of surviving. Chuck, after repeated attempts, has given up hope of returning to the civilized world, and after realizing he has no control even over the way he wishes to die, he simply lives on with the memory of his would-be-wife – Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt).

During the period when Broyles had marooned himself on an island, a ball came in with the tide and pop came the idea of the inanimate character – Wilson. Broyles highlights how a man is so helpless and no better than a rock, if his existence is not recognized by another. The character of Wilson has given the writer some creative liberty to make the film something not close to a silent film, and this stroke of genius mixed with some luck has been craftily used. The cinematography is commendable and the almost one sided conversations throughout the film are interwoven with hidden philosophies and memorable humor.

An emotional poetry of love, fate and belonging, Cast Away is a milestone in Hollywood cinema. To breathe so much life, meaning and humor into a subject so dark and tragic, needs pure genius. Chuck's longing for Kelly and his ultimate acceptance of his fate in the final scene between them is a timeless poem that will outlive the film's critics and lovers. Man needs to belong; that is the very crux of him. Don't forget this. This film won't let you.",10
25 October 2014,A heart breaking and compelling masterpiece,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

19 December 2008,A fine effort that falls a bit short due to a couple of poor choices,"""Cast Away"" centres on Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx employee stranded on a deserted island after his plane crashes. Entrenched in a desperate struggle for survival, he faces constant physical and emotional hardships. It's a high concept movie that harks back to the classic novel ""Robinson Crusoe"".

This was a demanding role for Tom Hanks and he ably carries the picture. The middle portion of the film is basically all Tom Hanks with his only interaction carried on with a volleyball that he transforms into a makeshift companion. Unfortunately, the film's other big name, Helen Hunt, delivers a performance that really makes you wonder how she ever won an Oscar. She and Hanks have absolutely no chemistry together and her poor acting makes the role even more unappealing.

The surprising thing about the film is how it turns a simple story of survival into an engaging film. Obviously, life on a deserted island is bound to be somewhat uneventful but Hanks & Zemeckis nevertheless retain our interest. The concluding portion of the film, however, leaves much to be desired and nearly ruins the film. Part of this is due to Hunt's performance but the storyline is hokey to begin with.

Director Robert Zemeckis delivers an attractive looking film with a wealth of fine outdoor cinematography. Also worth noting is the sound design, which really enforces the sense of realism on the island. Alan Silvestri's score is wisely dormant during this time, which gives it greater impact when featured at other times. All in all, the entire film is marked by high production values.

The film's glaring flaws do not outweigh the more polished elements but it is disappointing to see the film nearly derailed by a couple of poor choices. Nevertheless, the film is certainly worth watching for the good parts.",7
3 October 2010,Because tomorrow the sun will rise and who knows what the tide could bring?,"If you haven't seen this film, you are missing out on something extraordinary.

The direction of this film could've been any, but the precise way it was directed strung some chords for me, watching it was sensational. Rather than messages it could've given, the message it gave was like none other, this is one unique piece of art.

Everything in this film is well done, especially the acting, Tom Hanks scores again. Wilson was a great actor as well (hah), I've never felt so emotional over something like Wilson.

Cast Away isn't only about survival, it's about so much more, and it's truly inspirational.

If you haven't seen this film because of whatever reason (especially because it's a bit long) then you need to rethink your decision. Every minute of this film is enjoyable and patience is a virtue that really pays off.

Enjoy this film because Tom Hanks put his sweat and blood into this one, and it clearly paid off.",10
28 October 2012,No Q&A here,"If you are looking for a life-lesson, this movie stubbornly refuses to teach you anything.

It modestly shows what you already know: You will give up almost anything just to live, because you're human and humans are survivalists.

It carefully hides what you normally look for in a life-lesson story: what makes life worthwhile? What reward is there for all the pain and toil you may have suffered in the name of survival? That's exactly why this movie could be most uplifting to watch AND AT SAME TIME brutally honest about the human situation.

There would always be some book, some authority, some self-appointed life coach along to show you: this is how life works, this is the meaning of life, this is the big answer; and it's almost inevitable you fall for those at some point. What normally happens is you try to live the way they tell you, fulfilling some goals failing most, finally become disappointed in their ""big answer"". Confused and cynical, you move on to the next stage of your life.

Yet you still struggle, you still try, for something you know absolutely nothing about, with no logical reasons to ever achieve anything. All the while, life beacons you on with mystery and you cannot help but to walk on.

This move is a commentary on life, on humans. Those who thought this movie is ""ambiguous"" are perhaps looking for a life ""Q&A"". I can assure you, you would find no answers here.",10
19 March 2006,A quiet tour-de-force for Hanks,"Federal Express delivery manager Tom Hanks ends up stranded alone on an uninhabited island after a hellacious plane crash. Gorgeous-looking picture does have heavy-handed moments (Hanks looking and acting like a savage after a few years, presumably to make a point about man's raw beginnings), but they don't detract from the extremely well-made, well-paced proceedings. It doesn't delve deeply into its characters, but then it doesn't really have the time. It is a movie about personal survival, a litmus-test, and it's shrewdly written so that we in the audience find ourselves asking, ""Would I have thought of that?"" or ""What would I do in that situation?"" ""Cast Away"" is engrossing and satisfying; it didn't make the kind of big impression on me wherein I'm still haunted by it the following day, but Hanks gives a very sturdy performance (although his weight fluctuation is a little erratic) and, in support, Helen Hunt is natural and inoffensive. *** from ****

2 June 2013,"Admirable, but couldn't get into it","I had trouble getting into Cast Away right from the start. A lot of that has to do with Hanks, who I'm just not a big fan of. And that long FedEx speech, while somewhat interesting, was just not anything that would really happen.

I was feeling bored and restless, but I knew the real movie was to come, and the plane scene was pretty stunning and very intense, so that gave me hope.

Once he made it to the castaway section, well, I really respect the movie for it's gritty, almost wordless portrayal of a man with no camping skills grimly pushing himself to survive. It's very brave to offer so little dialog. But I just didn't feel it. I saw what the film was doing, I appreciated what it was doing, but I did not connect viscerally with the story. I'm not sure if this is because of my feelings about Hanks or because of the direction, which to me seems a little too Hollywood to really capture the pain and struggle.

People love this movie, and I can see appealing things about it, but I gave up after an hour of just not caring.",5
20 September 2001,"Hanks says a lot with so little, but what is in the box?","I was so upset when I saw commercials for Cast Away. I mean, how much of the movie do you have to let me know about before hand? I would have enjoyed the movie more if 80% of it wasn't shown to me in the commercials. That being said, Cast Away was a very enjoyable movie. Especially since Tom Hanks is such a brilliant actor. He says so much without saying much at all. He is a very expressive actor who lets his facial expressions and body language tell it all.

The movie was actually well paced. I have heard many complaints that this movie was slow and boring. As I have said before (in other reviews), if you can not enjoy anything more thought provoking than the latest N'Synch album or the latest episode of Dawson's Creek than this movie is not for you.

I do have one question though? What is in the box? I guess I'll have to scour the DVD for an easter egg with that information. (Hey, maybe I've watched too many episodes of Gilligan's Island. Yeah, that's it... I'm all screwed up like these N'Synch fans... just in a different way.",7
19 February 2014,Still entertaining after 14 years,"This is the kind of Hollywood movie I really like. I've seen it three times now, and after 14 years it is still hugely entertaining.

Hanks is fantastic here. This role was perfect for him, and he really gives it his all.

I suppose it's because I enjoy all castaway films; however, this is a particularly good one. Who hasn't dreamed of giving it all up and spending a long period on an island like this? To me, this movie is pure escapism. Unlike Chuck Noland, I'm sure I wouldn't need a Wilson.

The main star in this movie is not Hanks, but the island of Monuriki, Fiji. I really wonder whether there is any island like this left in the world anymore.

Has anyone been truly lost on a deserted island in recent years? Most castaways seem to be voluntary nowadays. Is something like this even possible in modern times? And aren't most beaches in the Pacific covered in garbage? We've already ruined it all, haven't we?

I suppose I could have done without the FedEx promotion. However, this didn't ruin the film for me.

I suppose it's all a metaphor for a harsh, uncaring universe. Sh*t happens, and when it does you have to get off your a*s, stop blaming the world, and make the best of it.

This movie could not have gone wrong with Zemeckis at the helm, Broyles as the writer, and Hanks in the main role. Kudos to them all for this great movie. It's worth about 8.5. I can't decide whether to give an 8 or 9, but for now I'll round it up. I think of this as one of my favourite movies.",9
30 September 2006,Engrossing,"Robert Zemeckis will probably never again reach the heights of ""Forrest Gump"", but I'm glad he continued making quality movies such as this one. Like ""Forrest Gump,"" this movie is one of a kind; it's unlikely we'll ever see another movie that takes the risks that this one did. To make a movie where over three-quarters of it is just Tom Hanks, half-naked and not talking, takes a lot of guts and a lot of skill. So did ""Forrest Gump,"" and Robert Zemeckis pulls it off again, though not quite with the same knack for weaving sentimentality into genuine drama that he displayed with ""Forrest Gump.""

The first two hours or so of the movie is brilliant. Zemeckis and Hanks present us with Chuck Noland, a by-the-clock-or-die FedEx supervisor, who is obviously in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), who, just as obviously, loves him back. He boards a plane to Malaysia to deliver some packages and tells her he'll ""be right back."" The plane crashes in the Pacific. Chuck is the only survivor and is washed up on a deserted island. And there is where the real movie begins. We see Chuck learn how to survive and fend for himself in sequences that could have been slow and tedious but, with the realism in which they are presented, become fascinating.

Tom Hanks's performance is just plain great. He takes up most of the screen time and Zemeckis lets us see into his passion and despair. Hanks, in fact, never takes a wrong step. It is the screenplay that trips up in the last 20 minutes of the production. Some people say the ending feels tacked on. I disagree; most of the ending is just fine, and fits right into this examination of what a real person would do in a situation like this. However, a few of Chuck's lines near the end strike a forced note- not because of Hanks delivery, but because one feels that no one could say something that cheesy well.

Even so, this is quite an experience. Not as creative as ""Forrest Gump,"" to be sure, but who cares? I don't think Zemeckis will ever try to beat his masterpiece and if he keeps making movies like this one he won't need to. This is good enough for me.",9
30 December 2000,Two-plus-hour long commercial for FedEx,"I liked the movie, although I was just overtaken with how this exemplifies product placement gone wild...this movie doesn't only feature soft drinks, coffee, sporting goods brands, but it is, in itself, one huge commercial for Federal Express...The U.S. Post Office should sue for restraint of trade or something. Yeah, Tom Hanks was pretty good, but the movie was overly long...could've used a commercial break.

20 January 2014,Makes you think,"This is not film for everyone, let's make this clear. Very slow in some parts, some people would say boring. But the fact is that this film is filled with emotions. Excellent acting by Tom Hanks, he carries the movie by himself. Story about not giving up. Most of us live in a nice environment and take normal every day stuff for granted. But when you see this film, you realize something, life is not about nice car, beautiful clothes and stuff like that, there is more to happiness. We don't appreciate all the things we have in life, ant this film is a reminder to enjoy life and be grateful for all we have. Ending is for some people lousy but for me is one of the best ending scenes ever(you will know what I am talking about when you see it). And of course, in my opinion, best soundtrack ever, such a lovely melody. Thank you cast away, you changed the way I look on (my) life.

9 August 2005,Greatly Enjoyed!,"I was not a Tom Hanks fan when I approached this movie. Probably my favorite of his projects up to this point was 'Bosom Buddies,' and, yes, that includes 'Saving Private Ryan.' I swore and threw stuff at my TV when he won his Oscars. What in hell were people thinking, giving this guy awards for his saccharine, watery-eyed everyman schtick? This kind of acting belonged in ibuprofen commercials.

Then I saw 'Cast Away.' I was nervous at first--although the prologue contained nothing overtly vomitous, it was still way too cute for my sensitive palate. Cute, boring guy's cute, boring girlfriend thinks he works too much; he very cutely, very boringly tricks her into thinking he's not going to propose, etc. Again, to the filmmakers' credit, the cute stuff was approached with a pretty subtle hand--but it doesn't take much to make me gag.

Then the plane goes down, and the movie turns into something else: part silent film, part philosophical indie, part horror movie. The direction is really quite amazing, especially coming from Robert Zemeckis. Who knew he had it in him, to combine such beautiful cinematography with such powerful imagery (the spear-fishing transition is an incredible movie moment), all in the context of what can only be thought of as an introspective non-story? Who knew that he was so tuned in to the power of silence? Who knew that he, or anyone, could milk honest-to-God tears from a man keeping himself sane through his 'friendship' with a volleyball? There were times when I couldn't believe this thing had played in mainstream theaters, it was so quiet and strange and sad. It had almost none of the usual crowd-pleasing crap, and that was beautiful.

And yes, Tom Hanks is good, very good. And I was ready for him to bomb, believe me. I may have even smiled at the idea of him marooned on an island with no food. (Where's your watering eyes now, Buffy?) But he surprised me--his performance was completely subtle, and completely believable, and completely sad. He probably should have gotten the Oscar this time.

But of course it couldn't really last, and in the final act the cuteness does creep in again. But it doesn't really matter. You can't take that middle section away from me, and in this case that's enough.

Much has been made out of the endless parade of FedEx logos, and you don't have to be a film-school graduate to notice (and laugh at) the over-the-top mise-en-scene. But who really cares about that? All in all, the beginning and ending make my grade something of a compromise, but I definitely recommend checking this one out. 8 out of 10.",8
21 February 2013,Cast Away — A lone survivor on a deserted island in the middle of the Pacific,"Cast Away shows you what life would be for a lucky shipwreck or plane crash survivor on a deserted island in the Pacific. It's tough, and very lonely.

The movie does an excellent job of showing us that, and also of setting up the character's life, and what would happen after he returns home. It is a drama, but it's not something designed to upset the viewer. Everything is done right: the editing, the soundtrack, the camera shots, the sets, the costumes, the accessories, the scenario, the dialogs, and the story.

Tom Hanks is perfect, a high note in his career, without a doubt. He brings excellent dramatic emotions to the screen, as well as incredible poise in the loneliness of his character and his defeated look, not to mention going to incredible dietary length to get really emaciated.

The only negative things I've found, are not that noticeable. First, the Christmas family dinner is a bit over done in true Hollywood fashion. Second, the ""sea"" during the crash is obviously set in a large artificial basin and the huge waves are CG. Third, the night time scenes on the island don't look real.

That being said, it's a must see.",9
21 March 2022,More Than Just A Soccer Ball,"A man obsessed with work, time, and materialism finds himself in a predicament where none of that matters other than surviving after his plane crashes. The movie is about more than just a man losing it on an island, and it is about more than a man who becomes separated from his wife, but it is about a person who re-contextualizes modern life from the perspective of having literally nothing and building a brand new life for himself, all the while holding on to just a glimmer of hope that he will be able to return and live his life in a way that truly matters to him.

16 May 2008,Zemeciks & Hanks: They bring the Gump magic back,"This is one of the finest movies ever made. I've lost count of how many times I have seen it. It was only about the Director and the Actor.. both of them have done an excellent job. Four years in an island... all by yourself... no one could have thought of anything like that. The best 'silent' actor in the movie was Wilson and his attachment to Chuck (Hanks). Kudos to the writer and director for introducing this character in the movie. Many viewers would feel that after Chuck returns from the deserted island, the movie starts getting boring; and that the director should have deleted a few scenes. However, every single take in this film was related to each other.

I would definitely give Cast Away a 10 out of 10 star rating **********

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball).

The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance.

8 March 2021,"A modern version of ""Enoch Arden"" focused on the man's lonely survival","There's a good story behind the making of ""Cast Away,"" that took six years from its initial idea, to locations, to a full year of filming with specific breaks, and then final production. Tom Hanks, who stars as Chuck Noland, had the initial idea for the film. He then collaborated with Bill Boyles and Bob Zemeckis for parts of the story. Boyles did the screenplay and Zemeckis directed the movie. For all of that, this is a unique film in how it came about - something quite out of the ordinary way of books, plays, tales or published stories making it onto film.

The core of this movie is one man's survival on an island for four years. The filming of that, Hanks' portrayal, and all aspects of this part are superb. But, the last part, after Noland's rescue at sea, is melodrama. To some extent, it can't help but be that. And this is the part that clearly marks this film as a modern adaptation of ""Enoch Arden."" There's no information readily available that makes the connection. But one has to think that Tom Hanks or any one of the other moviemakers had known about the early films based on Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem of that title. Surely, they at least must have seen one or more of the 1940 films that starred Cary Grant, Fred MacMurray, Melvyn Douglas, Irene Dunne, and Jean Arthur; or the 1963 movie that starred Doris Day, James Garner and Polly Bergen.

I think the last portion of the film - after Noland's rescue, takes the punch out of the film - of the one man's struggle for survival. In ""Enoch Arden,"" there wasn't great publicity about a lost person being found and rescued. So, he could return to home anonymously after 10 years and see how his wife and family had moved on. Then, out of love for them and their well-being, he chose to go away and remain the man lost at sea and presumed dead. That was a great ending for that poem and film. But it wasn't possible for this film with the extensive news industry that looks for spectacular stories of any kind. So, everyone learns about Noland's survival and rescue. When he returns home, he meets his former lover and her husband, and sees her at home with her child. Initially he was outraged that she was married, but after realizing he can't break up her family, he moves on and the film presents an ending that is passable.

What might have lifted this movie to the realm of great and memorable films would have been a different, original idea for the opening and ending in which to box the survival story. The FedEx aspect is fine, but the personal life of the lead needed to be changed. Then, the ending could be diverted from melodrama to something either uplifting or tied right back to the heroe's survival of the island.

Hanks is very good in his role, and the filming and production qualities are all very good. Perhaps Fox didn't want to make the connection to ""Enoch Arden"" because the film can't deliver on that film's impact, and it can't be another comedy version.",9
25 January 2014,Difference between living and surviving - exemplified,"The commitment to create a marvel does not stop with the director, it sure goes a long way than that. This movie sure proves the point and when you look at Tom Hanks in the start of the movie and then on after the mishap, the physical transformation and the commitment to make this movie work from the actor is commendable.

Creating a story out of delicate issues such a plane crash with a legit company name (FedEx), we are aware there will not be any heroism or any racy sequences which is a selling point for a commercial potboiler. But if the creators can compromise on the fact the movie can be rated ""Documentary"" then a real-life event can be adapted. But this movie is neither a documentary nor it has stupid goose chases. Still wins in every aspect of movie making and the credit goes to the director's mammoth effort and enacting it on the screen by Hero.

Many movies had limited characters with which the movie churns its story, here it has been limited to ONE. All over the movie you see Tom Hanks, except for the start and the end. Being a authoritative FedEx employee Tom hanks has sure got the grit to survive the ordeal and head back home from a deserted island

In such movies the end is always predictable, the hero lives to tell the tale, else how could we even recreate his suffering. Despite this fact the creators gives a gripping experience of his daily survival. Effective utilization of the resource, logic for his actions and the pain, agony that the character goes through everyday are the selling point of this epic.

There has been very little use for special effects team, but for the limited usage they have done a exceptional job. The wreck is sure looks real and whole incident is eye catching. If you look at it from point of a critic, i am sure they would come up with flaws, but from a common man point of view, this movie is success in every way and shouldn't be missed!!",8
9 February 2022,begins to be almost fun,"It is rather longer than it might be at the start and then at the end but during for the plane crash and the whole island time is splendid. Tom Hanks is excellent for the first part and no dialogue and then really good as he chats away. It appears at the beginning that he simply has a stupid number of parcels that had washed up as the FedEx from the crashed plane but gradually he finds them useful and it all begins to be almost fun.

12 December 2013,Marooned,"Robert Zemeckis directed this compelling drama that stars Tom Hanks as FedEx executive Chuck Noland, whose plane crashes into the ocean for an undetermined reason, and he manages to swim ashore to a deserted island, where he must learn to survive, as he will be marooned there for several years... Thoughts of his girlfriend Kelly(played by Helen Hunt) and a friend named Wilson(a volleyball he discovers among the damaged packages) keep him sane, though his eventual rescue at sea will in some ways be just as difficult... Superbly acted and directed film seems quite authentic and believable, even if the later scenes back home seem like a bit of a letdown, that may be part of the point!

26 April 2018,Flashes of brilliance are held back by a slow opening and a thematic shift in the third act.,"There are flashes of brilliance throughout 'Cast Away (2000)', mostly during the daringly dialogue-free mid-portion when Hanks is stranded on the island. It's when the story is told visually that it's at its most compelling, with the central performance remaining captivating throughout and the sense of isolation feeling palpable. It does have some pacing issues, though, including a slow opening that struggles to make you care about the character and an off-pace third act that takes the focus away from survival - placing it on living instead, which works thematically but does seem a little dull compared to what came before it. A film that can create a compelling relationship between a man and a volleyball has to be admired, though. 7/10

18 May 2023,Cast Away,"Tom Hanks excels in this well put together depiction of the archetypal, rather fastidious, business executive who finds himself stranded - after his plane crashes - on a remote tropical island. Completely ill-suited for life without any modern conveniences, but not without a brain cell or two, he has to adapt à la ""Robinson Crusoe"" to his new life of coconuts and whatever fish he can catch. The story takes it's time but that all contributes well to the effectiveness of his performance as he must deal with the physical, logistical and increasingly psychological challenges his predicament throws at him. Loneliness and despair fight against his human nature to thrive and to survive - and cause his creation of ""Wilson"", a sort of hybrid between a volleyball and a pineapple, for company! It was a Fed-Ex plane, which allows Robert Zemeckis to introduce some brief flashes of humour to lighten the mood - it's astonishing what people think to send to each other - and there is even a role for some ice skates to serve as a dentistry aid! As it progresses, we know that rescue is unlikely so are not surprised when his thoughts turn to venturing into the great, and turbulent, unknown - on a raft held together by plant threads and video tape. There isn't a great deal of jeopardy so the ending isn't really in doubt, but the effort here by Hanks and some solid writing and directing create quite a compelling and at times un-nerving film to watch. I've never really been one for the tropical island experience - I'm certainly not now!",7
13 January 2022,Good Cinema,"This maybe my favorite Tom Hanks film - something about it intrigues me. I believe the film fascinates be because it's a fairly realistic look a what might happen if it were a true story - that includes talking to a volley ball with a face for company.

It's worth watching if you've never seen this movie.

9/10.

25 February 2004,GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE OCEAN!,"Recently viewed this film and was amazed at the great photography and how beautiful the Island was, Monuriki, Fiji; the beautiful waves and terrifying heights in which the waves towered over poor Tom Hanks (Chuck Nolan),""Catch Me If You Can"",'02, who played an outstanding role as a man stranded on a lonely island except for a ball with a face painted on it with his own blood! This film started out in a nowhere place and kept your interest to the very end with travels to Russia and remote areas unknown. Helen Hunt(Kelly Frears),""What Women Want"",2000, played a very brief role but important and her acting with Chuck Nolan was very dramatic and drew lots of tears. Kelly gave Chuck her grandfather's watch from his days working for the Southern Pacific Railroad with her picture and it appeared quite often in the film. In other words, 'Pictures Speak Louder Than WORDS'!! Tom Hanks is definitely a SUPER STAR and this film is worth the time to VIEW!

25 July 2020,"A fantastic film, steeped in realism, with an emotional core","There is a lot of praise given to Tom Hanks for his performance in Cast Away, and that is absolutely earned. However, you've also got to give credit to the director, Robert Zemeckis, and the writer, William Broyles, for creating a story with a single actor, an isolated setting, and very little dialogue that is so compelling. This is a fantastic film, steeped in realism, with an emotional core. Watch this film, it could save your life one day (if you're ever trapped on a deserted island).

19 October 2002,Stripped down Robinson Crusoe with an all white cast,"A Fed-Ex employee gets stranded on a dessert island.

One of these two o' clock in the morning movies: It sounds like a good idea when you come up with it, but you laugh about it the next morning. Here they have made it.

Tom Hanks on an island. How many gags can you come up with? Learning to make fire? Finding shelter? Painting a volleyball and talking to it? Yes they have played all the cards that are available, but the hand is, sadly, threadbare.

The world's biggest Hank/Zemeckis fan is going to need a spare cushion to be able to stand three hours of this. Even when Hanks was doing exploitation it was entertaining exploitation. Given his slightly chubby appearance Hanks looks like he misses his gym as much as the other luxuries of life.

Sure, the movie has its moments of mild drama and interest, but even the word thin is an understatement. I cannot find a single reason to watch this movie, other than if you are a CCTV operator and need to give your pulse a rest...",4
19 May 2021,Tom Hanks in his prime.,"Tom Hanks best performance 100%.

Yes I love all his 80's movies, and Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies. However, his other great movies are only great because of the movie itself ... In this film the only reason it's great is because of Tom Hanks... and tbh I don't really respect him as a person... but this is an amazing performance by Tom Hanks.

Edit: I take that back, Turner and Hooch is another movie that is only great because of Tom Hanks.... a lot of crappy dog movies out there... This is the best dog movie ever.

So if you're new to watching Tom Hanks movies heres my take...

1) Cast Away 2) Turner and Hooch 3) Forrest Gump 4) The Lady Killers 5) Big.

25 July 2021,Beautiful,"This film is generally very beautiful and never loses its insensitivity at any point. The plot, though quite obvious, is full of twists and unexpected moments. The film also developed very well the psyche in continuous degradation of the protagonist but this aspect is a little pulled away in the final. On the other hand, it's a well-crafted film that keeps you glued to the screen from the beginning to almost the end.

SIDE NOTE: The chemistry between Hanks and Hunt is so perfect, I wish we could get a true-blue rom-com starring them.

Barely a single shot does not contain the logo.

I don't go to the movies to watch adverts, it irritates me that the level of product placement has got to this level.

Info-mercials are for cheap late night telly, not for prime-time cinema.

Give this film what is deserves, a miss!

23 November 2020,A Remarkable Adventure,"This is the ultimate Robert Zemeckis film. A man, alone with a problem that he needs to solve, a handful of tools at his disposal, all of which he uses, and long takes. This is the movie that he was born to make, and it's the movie he had been building up to with decades of experience. Young Zemeckis could not have pulled off the quiet of Tom Hanks' life on a deserted island like this.

Chuck is a FedEx employee who helps set up and fix foreign branches of the company. He starts in Moscow, establishing an office and talking endlessly about how Time is the ultimate enemy. He lives his life by the clock. The clock on the wall in the Moscow office is what that office is to operate by. He's constantly referencing the time and how long it will take to do things. He has a fiancée, Kelly, in Memphis, Tennessee that he loves and tries to see as much as possible, but his work just keeps pulling him away. On Christmas Eve, Chuck gets a message that something needs fixing in Asia, so he jumps on a plane after a nice goodbye with Kelly that includes a potential engagement ring in a wrapped package, and the cast away begins.

Robert Zemeckis is an incredibly talented and technical minded director, so the idea that the crash sequence would be good is kind of baked into the cake of Cast Away. However, this crash sequence is amazing and might be the single best sequence Zemeckis ever put together. The build up around the jostle that wakes Chuck up, the storm outside, the quick look at a screen showing them off course, the increased turbulence, the sudden explosion, the loss of cabin pressure, the crash, the sinking fuselage, the raft finding its way to the surface with Chuck desperately clinging on, and then the camera pulling back slowly as Chuck, a small figure on the big ocean only lit by lightning strikes, gets steadily smaller and smaller. It's a bravura sequence that uses image and sound perfectly, planting the audience at the center of the chaos without ever losing sight of Chuck or the overall movement around him, keeping the evolving action clear while providing us our emotional groundwork in Chuck.

Once on that island, the movie markedly changes on purpose. The first section of the film was loud and busy with Chuck dominating conversations constantly as he lived by a clock. Suddenly, there's no one to talk to and time doesn't matter. That change is what makes the life on the island so stark. Opening the movie with this would be one thing, dropping us into it after thirty minutes of completely different modes of storytelling is something else. The audience can feel as isolated and alone as Chuck as he calls out impotently to no one while quietly picking up a handful of floating packages on the shore (and sorting them by destination, of course) and figures out how to survive. The grounded nature of Chuck's search for a way to survive is compelling even as it covers small ground. Fire, of course, is something that we can completely take for granted, but when the only food Chuck can manage to eat is the meat of coconuts because crab legs are goop without being cooked we can understand the quiet determination and loud outbursts of frustration that grip Chuck as he tries to make fire for the first time.

This is the introduction of the other main character in the film, Wilson the volleyball. There's a basic narrative need to give Chuck someone to talk to without him just talking to himself, and the creation of Wilson is a good place to direct that energy. Born from his own blood after an accident with the fire sticks, Wilson provides a face that Chuck can speak to, sort out his thoughts, and let the audience know what Chuck ends up planning to do. That there is an emotional connection to Wilson at all is really derived from Chuck's very understandable need to simply have someone else in his life other than the sand and trees around him. His sole companion for four years means something to him, and because we can understand the depth of Chuck's plight we can understand that emotional connection to a smear of blood on a white volleyball. Maybe we can or cannot share in it, but we can certainly understand it.

There's a time jump of four years, and the physical transformation of Hanks from one side of that jump to the other is rather stark. The production famously shut down for an entire year (when Zemeckis made What Lies Beneath with the same crew) so that the pudgy Tom Hanks could slim down to his far thinner frame for the second half of the film, but that's only part of the transformation. Hanks was nominated for an Oscar in this role, and he deserved that nomination. The boisterous and gregarious fixer becomes incredibly different through those four years. He's quieter and more manic on the island, and when he gets off the island, suddenly surrounded by the world he had so easily fit into before, he's so quiet and small in comparison to who he was. The man who was so comfortable in the middle of a crowded conversation now looks like he would rather sink through the floor than bear another minute of it, but he's just too meek to do anything about it. That personal transformation is far more impressive than the physical transformation.

The effort to get off the island is the sort of goal based narrative that Zemeckis was so familiar with. This is really the core of the idea that this is the ultimate Zemeckis film, the goal is the only thing for such a long stretch. Chuck decides that he can use the half of a port-a-potty that washes up on his shore as a sail, but he only has a few months to form the necessary rope, build the raft, stock it, and launch it before the weather turns against him until the next year. The effort to make all of that happens is surprisingly compelling because we have a clear goal, clear stakes, and a likeable protagonist that we can root for all wrapped up together and focused on with clear-eyed purpose. It helps that the combination of on location filming and special effects are so seamless that everything about the production feels completely real.

The advertising famously gave away the ending of the film in the trailer and made it clear that it was giving away the ending. Occasionally trailers will show you shots from late in the film, but in the context of the trailer you don't realize it (the trailer for Eastern Promises has the final shot of the entire film in the trailer, for example), but it was obvious that the trailer was giving everything away. Zemeckis called it a marketing decision based on research that showed that people liked to know exactly what they were getting before they walked in, using McDonald's food as an example (he could have potentially used popular police procedurals like CSI as another). This really irritated some reviewers like Roger Ebert who couldn't get past the film's marketing to judge the movie and its ending on their own.

So, let me talk about the ending and why it's great.

Chuck gets off the island and he's a different man. He no longer cares about time, but he does still love Kelly. And yet, it's been more than four years since he left. She may have been a constant for him in a place without time, but time continued on without him. Kelly grieved and moved on, marrying and having a daughter. At the beginning of the movie, Chuck was so concerned with the time around his job that he never made the time for Kelly, the two needing to negotiate schedule books to discover when they would next see each other when Chuck gets called away for his fateful flight to Asia. Now, returned to Memphis, he understands how to appreciate time, and he can no longer have the one thing he wants most in the world. He could have had her had he prioritized her, staying home on Christmas instead of going to Asia, but after he made that decision there's no turning back. He has to move on, just like she did. It's a wonderful embrace of the central idea that runs through the whole film.

Cast Away is a great technical achievement, which is no surprise from Zemeckis, but it's also incredibly intelligent thematically and mature cinematically. Zemeckis has grown into an incredibly assured filmmaker. I hope he doesn't fall in love with weird computer animation, though. That would be weird.",10
17 September 2006,Life cannot be appeared.....,"His life, it was certain that he would get his wife, his house, and many thing.....That has destroyed by one storm. The only survivor was him. And small, tiny island. He tried to escaped sometimes, but he realized it can't help but fail because of high waves. He waited timing and after few years left, he finally escaped and came back to his life.

The one thing I've impressed when I saw this movie is life's sadness, and many of ways to go in his case. Where will people go? Where will people choose? As the best way to go is not easy to be figured out, people always suffer from their choices. This movie tells this point exactly. The man, who drifted to a island, confuses many times until he escaped the island; if it is right to be alive and it is all unworthful in front of me....It shows people's typical life. This movie shows one person's victory and sending-off his new journal.

24 July 2018,One of the best Tom Hanks films,"Castaway is a perfect Tom Hanks movie where he gets to showcase his skills as an actor. Robert Zemeckis has directed a new take on the Robinson Crusoe saga with a man marooned on an island with nothing more than his perseverance and patience. This may be an adventure film on the surface but there are underlying themes of loneliness, loss and isolation. Of course, there are some stupendous scenes, this being CGI obsessed (in a good way) Zemeckis. The plane crash is a highlight and different from what we have seen in other films and the island scenes with the waves are amazing. As mentioned above Hanks is so good you cannot picture anyone else in his role and his collaboration with the director keeps on flourishing (they also made the critically lauded Forrest Gump). Do not miss Castaway for anything.

28 December 2000,No Tom is an island,"Watch the ads for Robert Zemeckis' new movie and you'd think that this is a movie about a man stranded on a deserted island, a la Robinson Crusoe. So did I, but Tom Hanks' character doesn't wind up on the island until a good 20 minutes of filler material have been used. Filler material, in most movies, is the kind of plot information that seems superfluous at first but is later tied into the plot itself. So we're 20 minutes into a movie and finally see Chuck Noland (Hanks) on the island. You can see where this review is headed, can't you?

First off, there's the title. Cast Away? Why not Castaway? Why make it into two words? A puzzlement, to be sure. I know, I know... nitpicking! No, it's not! If it's two words, it says to me someone has been cast away - but Chuck hasn't been cast away, he's been marooned. Maybe the makers didn't want anyone to confuse it with the Survivor TV show. I think they should have gone with the one-word title, but hey - that's just me.

The movie is a little over two hours long, and in the bulk of that time we follow Chuck's exploits on the island. We see his trials, his failures, his successes, and his thought processes. And it all really is mesmerizing, as long as you suspend some of your logic processes. This happens with a lot of action/adventure type movies, because the focus is on what's happening, not why it's happening. Sometimes you'll see an illogical chain of events in an action movie, and you'll dismiss it because you're there to see the action, not to be bothered with the plot. Well, friends, I am bothered by it! I wondered how Chuck survived the plane crash and why he got out what looked like everything in his pocket just before the plane hit turbulence but once the trouble started he only grabbed his precious pocket watch. I wondered if I was watching a long commercial for Federal Express (see how many logos you can spot).

I've seen some people say this is one of the top movies of the year. Sorry, I can't see that. It's fun to watch, but the compelling stuff in the middle is surrounded by a beginning and an end that slow down the pacing of the film immeasurably. Sure, I care about Chuck's beau Kelly (Helen Hunt), and I know that setting up their relationship at the outset is somewhat important. But it's more than a little contrived when his last words to her before jumping on the plane are ""I'll be right back."" Come on! All of the supporting plot surrounding his adventures on the island seems to be horribly contrived, as if someone said, ""Great, love the whole island thing, now throw in some more stuff so we can get over 2 hours out of it."" I mean it all seems almost tacked on, and it's all too pat. I will say this much, though: the ending is NOT cliched.

Hanks is better than I expected. He's not really the adventurer type, is he? In some scenes, with his scraggly beard and makeshift clothing, he looks like Lawrence of Arabia or maybe Moses from The Ten Commandments. He effectively shows emotion, determination, perseverence, wit, and ingenuity. I'd also say he ages well, too, but then you have to remember Robert Zemeckis filmed this movie in two installments so he could do What Lies Beneath; this layoff allowed Hanks to transform from girly man Fed Ex dude to strapping strongman (sort of). Everyone else is just extraneous. This is Tom's game.",6
3 January 2021,Hugely enjoyable,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",8
14 June 2016,Masterpiece,"Up until two days ago, I had never seen Cast Away. Not once in my life. I know, try not to have a heart attack. I knew the whole story, each and every beloved plot twist mapped out for me by eager friends, word of mouth, online fare and pop culture over the years. I just never sat down and actually watched the darned thing. Well I did two nights ago, and damn if I didn't wish I'd done that sooner. It's every bit as incredible as I've heard all this time, and more so. It's one thing to know everything about a film just because of its notoriety, and quite another to see it, obviously. I experienced every scene, every landmark event in the film for the first time ever, and my foreknowledge of it did not dampen one wondrous second of the experience. Few films bring you as close to their protagonist as this does, for two and a half patient, spellbinding hours in the life of a man whose path has taken a turn for the extraordinary. Tom Hanks is the right guy for the job, and then some. He's immediately likable and exudes currents of good nature and humility. Perfect casting choice. He plays Chuck Noland, a FedEx honcho with a busy life that scarcely makes room for his doting girlfriend (Helen Hunt). One Christmas eve, he's forced to run out on her for an overnight package flight. As we all know, his plane crashes somewhere in the South Pacific, and he's forced to survive on a deserted island for almost half a decade. We feel every empty minute, every momentous triumph right alongside Chuck, from the first dazed stroll along the wave speckled beach of his new home, to the final, raging ditch effort to find his way back to civilization. Director Robert Zemeckis let's this larger than life tale unfold with steady, earnest shots and a down to earth score, a very simplistic approach that let's Hanks do most of the heavy lifting. And lift he does, in a performance of sheer courage and transformative qualities. We see Chuck go from suburban joe and real world businessman to a near feral being, forged into something more than himself by the same forces that govern and mold the geography which he now inhabits, while never losing his humanity in the wild chaos. The time spent stranded is sandwiched between two segments that bookend the film, in which we see his life in civilization before, and eventually after his experience. The impeccable pacing tricks the audience into feeling like we've been watching this play out for as many years as he's been living it. I mean this as a profound compliment to the filmmakers and not to say the film ever drags, in fact, for a two plus hour running time it feels surprisinly slight. It all rests on Hank's shoulders, and he carries it beautifully, selling this man's plight with truth, humour and resilience. An experience for the ages, and one that you should see right out of the gate in your cinematic exploration, as opposed to waiting till your mid twenties like someone we know. Masterpiece.",10
20 December 2005,Enthralling Middle Section Marred by Opening and Closing,"""Cast Away"" opens with a relentless commercial for Fed Ex, even with the crash, ""When it absolutely, positively has to be there the next morning"" and how that claim creates a certain work ethic around the world.

Cut off the beginning and ending and it's an absolutely terrific modern Robinson Crusoe minus Friday movie.

The waves were far more effective and realistic (and terrifying) than the touted ones in ""Perfect Storm."" Too bad the special effects won't get noticed precisely because they are so believable rather than fantastical. The camera work on the water is excellent.

Tom Hanks is quite the Everyman as the whole audience wonders if they would be as inventive as he in surviving with an unusual set of resources. The silence and Hanks's performance on the island are completely involving.

The entire audience questioned a closing gimmick that is simply a concluding Fed Ex commercial.

5 August 2003,Dramatic Story,"I liked ""Cast Away"" because it takes you far away from our rush hour time. On the other side we assist a well developed dramatic story with full of adventures. There is not that usual big action but lot of many new things that the lost man on the nice isle has to do. The transformation from the FedEx employee to Robinson Crusoe was incredibly good and Tom Hanks you are great. Robert Zemeckis created another masterpiece. There is not a happy end but I don't tell you more...just watch and enjoy this trip. My wife and I give 8/10.

15 July 2022,"Superb Direction, Phenomenal Acting and an Excellent Story","Cast Away is a raw movie that offers an outstanding performance from Tom Hanks in a roll in which he is stranded on a deserted island. And it's not only his acting on the screen that makes him a star, it's the fact that he dedicated himself to this movie by starving himself to look suitable for the role. Other than the perfect acting from the entire cast, director Robert Zemeckis delivers a great cinema experience, with beautiful shooting of a well-selected location and some spectacular music.

The entire area of the movie that simply features Tom Hanks trying to survive on the deserted island is unquestionably perfect. There's graphic injuries he suffers that make it extremely tough to watch, and to the point where you literally wince. Every time he achieves anything big for survival like creating a fire, you feel his power, pride and strength. But you also feel his disappointments and sorrows, too.

Along with this man starving on this island and his physical appearance changing, there's also quite a strong emotional aspect to it. And it's worth saying that during the time he's stuck on the island, there's not a complete lack of dialogue; he creates a companion out of a ball in which he makes it a face out of his own blood and he talks and has a connection with it.

There's dumb movies like the Child's Play movie series in which Chucky is by himself and he talks to himself in a stupid way that makes sure that the audience knows what he's doing and thinking. This movie would be exactly like that, but with the fact that there's a companion, even if it doesn't walk, talk or breath, Hanks is talking to the ball like he's telling us what he's thinking, doing or how he's feeling, which is clever and original. The only real problems with Cast Away is how the first section, also called the introduction, is not really engaging and the film's ending isn't satisfying.

29 December 2006,A Damn Fine Achievement in movie making,"Hats off to Tom Hanks for one of the finest on-screen performances ever, he truly captures the loneliness, turmoil and slightly mad eccentricity that grows in the character of Chuck Noland.

Hats off to Robert Zemeckis for daring to attempt this story, and running the risk of serious criticism from the shallow movie viewer, and i applaud him for pulling it off, without cheapening the experience.

Cast Away uses no gimmicks, gadgets, special effects or dramatic music, in fact it uses no tricks at all to try and heighten the viewing pleasure for the casual viewer. It is simply the story of one's mans struggle against nature and a test of his will, and without question it works well.

15 October 2001,Forrest Gump goes sailing.,"I hated it.

The film from start to finish was product placement. Basically, it is an advert for Fed-Ex and Wilson.

I rate Tom Hanks but this was just so dire that it's soured him for me.

The only interesting scene was the plane crash and him consistently maiming himself, aside from that dullsville all the way. I wasn't expecting a rollercoaster of thrills and chills, I thought it would be really character based but I don't think that worked at all on any level.

Appalling movie and a wasted opportunity.

28 May 2022,A real life story of loneliness,"Robinson crusoe movie that I watched at a time that corresponds to many years ago. But it's weird that people go to the movie and squint and stare with the line ""Aaaa. It is obvious that such a theme will be encountered from its advertisement to its story. The only question mark would be how to tie the ending.

I went to the movie knowing all this. All I was wondering was if Tom Hanks gave an Oscar-winning performance. And I still remember a single scene with Tom Hanks acting that is etched in my memory:

Tom, who managed to light a fire on the deserted beach, showed the fire with joy as if he had erected a great monument around the fire and proudly as if thousands of people were watching and applauding him:",8
13 August 2021,Tom Hanks Classic,"A classic and iconic film which delivers exactly what you might expect. Hanks' performance is perfect over the longitudinal plot, varying in accordance with the circumstances. Having a solitary character interact with just his surroundings is a little limiting, but the context and backstory is enough to push everything along. It is a long film, and the tying up of all the loose ends towards the finish can drag a little, but really there is a reason why Cast Away is so famous. Not many films can get you to care for a volleyball.

20 October 2005,Mr. Wilson.... thumbs down,"Oh boy. Another Tom Hanks film.

'Cast Away'... it received a lot of positive feedback when it came out, but it's suddenly been forgotten now. Even Mr. Wilson, the star of the film, couldn't bring the audience back and keep them. Mr. Wislon even put on better acting than Tom Hanks - nothing personal against the man, but there for a while, he was cast away in similar roles of the unsung hero type.

'Cast Away' certainly isn't a great film. It was enjoyable to watch for a little while. It even did a decent job of observing a man stranded on a deserted island. It even had a fairly happy ending. If you're in for these types of romanticized films, you'll probably think this is a pretty decent movie. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it and say that anyone has to see this film.

Mr. Wilson was the star. He needs to come out in a film all of his own.",4
21 February 2001,"Good but not inspired ""star movie"". Too much FedEx","Tom Hanks successfully carries this movie, which centers on a single character like few others for a large part of its time. It is an unabashed vehicle for Hanks.

Still, I was less impressed with his performance (good, not great) than others on the Net. Helen Hunt is good as always, but finally does not really get a chance to display her skills fully. Like in Forrest Gump, I felt that serious moments were somewhat awkwardly acted - since I have seen better from both Hanks and Hunt in other movies, I'll blame the writing or director.

In contrast to others, I did not feel this movie was ""disjointed"", the very distinct parts make sense from the story-telling point of view and emphasize the experiences of the main character.

All in all I enjoyed this movie and it lingered on for while, even though the heavy, heavy Fed-Ex exposure almost managed to spoil it for me.",6
27 February 2022,Outstanding film gave me goosebumps,"If you feel touched emotionally by this movie, you are truly human. The movie ends with Tom Hanks standing at a dusty crossroad surround by dry open fields and there is nobody around. It can be interpreted by many as an empty feeling inside such as how they feel when a relationship ends or somebody close has died. Where do we go from here now that something has ended? When he met his wife again after a long absence, it was easy to see that something was missing. After all the hugs and kisses, there was something missing that once bonded them together. Too bad it has to be called acting but it was perfect acting throughout the whole movie.

14 May 2020,Cast Away is an emotional story 8/10,"The whole point of the film is man surviving Nature, which is a famous case in a lot of survival movies. Only in this particular film. It is man surviving an island with a volleyball. The whole movie focuses on one character, Chuck Nolan. Tom Hanks is doing a terrific job. Chuck is faced with the dangers of the island and the fact that he is all alone with no one to talk to. This is also the kind of movie that I love. The kind of movies where the hero needs to face a danger bigger than war or explosions... in one word - Nature. And that is what I want to see.

It's one of those film where in the 2min trailer you have seen the movie.

Acting is ok, but that doesn't make up for a lame plot. Gravity succeeds much better at this topic. Why still a 4, well it looks kinda ok.

26 April 2004,Story about survival,"Cast Away is a story about survival. Chuck Noland is a Federal Express systems engineer whose ruled-by-the-clock existence abruptly ends when a plane crash leaves him isolated on a remote island.

I was most impressed with the plane crash sequence which takes place about 20 minutes into the film, after Chucks character has been established and the equilibrium is understood.

Chuck, along with the crew of a Fed-Ex aircraft are travelling above the Pacific Ocean, 200 miles off course. At this point the audience realises there may be something wrong, as Chuck is told by a crew member to fasten his seat belt for a bumpy ride.

The camera is hand held and is no higher than Chuck's shoulder height throughout this entire sequence. This helps us feel closer to Chuck by being involved in what is happening to him. The audience is seeing what Chuck is seeing as the sequence is shot from his side of the story. We never know more about the situation than Chuck, and this adds to the fear.

The fact that the camera is quite jerky makes the viewer feel uneasy, as though in danger. These types of camera movements are necessary as there are no external points of reference to show the plane is moving.

Suddenly there is an explosion and within a split second Chuck is being sucked out of the bathroom. This is a very dramatic sequence as the entire mood of the film changes suddenly. The camera is positioned on Chuck, as he is clinging for life onto the bathroom door frame.

The sound becomes one of the most effective elements of this sequence in creating fear and panic. The noises of the plane as it descends are abstract and eerie. A mixture of engine noise and wind howling through the plane become the forefront of the sound, and almost block out any other noises, for example voices of the crew and the banging of objects flying round. This creates a very frightening yet surreal atmosphere, which you may expect if thrust into this situation.

The camera remains with Chuck, following his actions and watching his reactions. Although there are other people on board the plane, the viewer's main concern is Chuck's safety.

The camera techniques used during this sequence go a long way in creating a very intense and terrifying atmosphere. The camera movement allows the viewer to realise the danger the aircraft is in, whilst also creating a documentary style which gives the viewer the feeling of actually being there.

Also, the hard cuts and swift pans and tilts again give a factual feel, allowing the audience to be a part of the scene. This technique makes it seem as if there has been no creative image processing involved, and is a very clever example of how a camera can be used to create an atmosphere so intense.",

4 February 2020,Tom Hanks has a ball,"Hanks' performance in this movie is top-notch. His co-star (the ball) had no actual lines of dialogue in the movie, but you can just FEEL the emotions coming through from the ball's performance. Honestly, I was surprised that the ball didn't at least get nominated for best supporting actor.

Anyway, it's Hanks on an island dealing with what you'd expect... Sand in all the wrong places... Nothing but coconuts to eat... And not a single pretty lady to keep him company...

Great performance from Hanks and a great film overall

24 July 2020,Cast away,"I have never seen a more meaningful and thought-provoking film. Right from the start, I knew this was going to be a classic film, and my opinion was not changed throughout the course of the movie one bit. It delivers such a strong message of fear, survival and hope, that leaves your mind devoted to thinking about it for a long while after. It made me think about all my creature comforts, and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic! I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film, maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV, but anyway, it sort of made you guess how he was feeling, in a clever way. This is one of my all time favourite films, and I could watch it again and again without getting bored... so go and watch it...NOW!

10 June 2022,Survival movie,"Cast Away has a strong resemblance to Robert Zemeckis' previous film, Contact. Forrest Gump was part folky feel-good drama, part sly satire. Cast Away may not be as well-known, but it provides a richer, more satisfying experience. The third act of the film provides no easy solutions to difficult situations.

Screenwriter William Broyles Jr. And director Robert Zemeckis avoid melodramatic clichés. Because he is on screen by himself for more than half of the time, Tom Hanks is responsible for the film's success. Helen Hunt, who became a film fixture after ""Mad About You,"" is the only other significant player. This is unquestionably her best work in a long time.

14 March 2002,Tom Hanks' Performance Is the Calling Card Here.,"""Cast Away"" is an interesting concept that has been done before, but never quite like this. The film follows a FedEx man (Hanks, in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is stranded on a tropical island in the middle of the ocean after a terrifying plane crash. What follows is his journey to survive with minimal supplies (what he has on the island and a few packages he was to deliver) and no human interaction. Hanks gives a stunning performance and basically the film is little more than a way to show off his amazing versatility as an actor. However, Hanks lacks the material and of course the supporting performers he had in greater films like ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". Helen Hunt is only present in limited screen-time as Hanks' love interest. In all ""Cast Away"" is worth a look for Tom Hanks, but do not expect much more than Tom having conversations with a Wilson volleyball. 4 stars out of 5.

15 January 2021,It was intriguing eventhough there wasn't much dialogue,"The plot of the movie which is about a guy being stranded on an island is a pretty simple plot, but it still kept me intrigued throughout. Obviously there wasn't much dialogue during a certain part of the movie, but I was still intrigued as I was wondering how the character is going to get out of this situation. Some people might say certain parts or details of the movie are not realistic and I would probably agree with them, however this is a movie so it's not meant to be fully realistic.

10 April 2006,what Gilligan forgot to tell us,"Maybe we wonder how many movies and/or TV shows about people stranded on uncharted islands there can be. ""Cast Away"" of course portrays Fed Ex employee Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) getting stuck on a Pacific island after a plane crash and having to use his own ingenuity to survive, even after he ends up looking like a cross between a beggar and Moses. I personally think that they could have just left it at that and not had any of the stuff about his relationships with people. But Wilson made an interesting character. Of course, a particularly unpleasant scene portrays his dental work. Overall, I guess that there's not much here that we haven't seen, but Hanks's performance keeps everything afloat, especially in the fire scene.

And I guess that Gilligan did forget to tell us about the coconuts.

23 December 2008,A refreshing change of pace with a touching story,"'I'll be right back!' Such were the words shouted by Chuck Noland to his girlfriend Kelly Frears as he hurries off to catch his waiting plane. Little does he suspect how horribly ironic these words become once his tale is over.

In Robert Zemeckis' great 'Cast Away', Tom Hanks incarnates Chuck Noland, a highly-efficient FedEx executive whose life is mercilessly governed by the clock. He's in a relationship with Kelly Frears (the pretty Helen Hunt), yet their love is constantly postponed or halted by Chuck's unforgiving timetable. Soon he's called out on a business trip just before Christmas, and he and Kelly exchange some quick gifts: she gives him a pocket watch with her picture in the lid, and he gives her an engagement ring box, which she is to open on New Year's Day only  with him there with her. He then leaves and boards the plane.

Unfortunately, something goes terribly wrong during the flight (we never learn what, nor is it relevant) and the plane smashes somewhere into the Southern Pacific ocean. The crash scene, with all its technical and visual excitement, is the most terrifying and heart-pounding sequence of its kind I have ever seen. It's so sudden, so unexpected, and so realistic, that you can't help but feel nearly as shocked and horrified as Chuck himself as he sees clouds, and eventually waves, scream past the cockpit windows, coming ever closer  He is the only survivor, and soon he washes up on a large and eerily magnificent desert island, and a quick look-see confirms his worst fears: he's absolutely isolated in the middle of the ocean, and no-one knows where he is  or that he's even alive.

By then we're barely a quarter into the movie, and the pace, formerly so fast-paced and hurried, suddenly crashes to a halt. All time stands still on the island, itself unchanged for millions and millions of years; only the dull thuds and cracks of falling coconuts, or the occasional arriving flotsam, provide distraction to the new routine Chuck has to endure: survival without any electricity, food, water or equipment. Everything he uses, he improvises  sometimes with painful results, other times with triumph. A man who once lived by the pager and the timetable suddenly finds himself in a land where the very concept of 'time' is as alien as fish on Mars, and what he does to survive, both physically and mentally, is where the true storytelling power of the movie lies.

The movie is very slow-paced as we follow Chuck's attempts at staying alive, yet unlike most other times where I'd say this, for this movie, being slow is far from criticism; it's praise. The movie doesn't hurry through Chuck's exploits and actions just to 'get to the point'. The story takes its time to settle comfortably into its niche, and once it does, it's truly riveting, even though all we're really looking at is one man on an island, drinking coconut juice and suffering from a toothache without a dentist.

The acting is outstanding, especially for Tom Hanks as the castaway in person; he supports the entire movie, and the audience gets to feel both his triumphs and his pains. One scene where he finally is able to light a large signal fire is surprisingly jovial and heartwarming as we see the desperate man jumping, ecstatic, around the burning flames, chanting and avoiding sparks. Other scenes truly make us feel terribly sorry for the man, but rather in resigned, compassionate way. For example, to stay sane, Chuck begins to speak to a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball, on which a smeared bloody handprint inadvertently created a vague face. Naming the ball 'Wilson', Chuck speaks to 'him' as thought they were old friends, and by then we're so in-tune with Chuck's desperation and loneliness we barely even realize the oddity of a grown man merrily conversating with a volleyball.

I naturally can't divulge what happens at the end, or if Chuck ever makes it off the island or not, but I can nonetheless comment on the fact that personally, I found it slightly disappointing. It was a logical ending to the tale (one you may already have guessed if you haven't seen the movie yet), but some parts of it seemed forced, even somewhat clichéd and corny at times. I also didn't understand some of what happened at the very end; perhaps it was too subtle for me. (But then, 'too' subtle would also be ground for criticism.) This is not a movie for viewers who expect action and flash, or for sufferers of short attention spans. For those who are able to take a break from their lives, which so often mirror Chuck Noland's in their pacing, this story will be a soothing and refreshing change of pace while it lasts, and will make a very good addition to any movie-lover's collection.

* * * * * For giving us a story with a refreshing change of pace, a lot of sentiment and depth, and some formidable acting, I award 'Cast Away' 8.5 friendly volleyballs out of 10.",8

Odds are you'll be flipping through the channels and happen upon this en medias res, which means you'll have skipped at least part of the boring beginning and if your lucky jump right in during the incredible plane crash sequence. Trust me, this happens a lot. Also, you can just turn it off as soon as he makes his final attempt to leave the island. See? How many flicks are that custom made for the home viewer?

13 September 2008,A Journey To Think On,"I recently re-visited this film and watched it in detail to really watch this character's journey.

I found something new to enjoy each time. Hats off the William Broyles Jr. for doing the research that made a big difference in how the character of Chuck Nolan took shape, and the events in his life that changed it. Of course I love Robert Zemeckis directing. There are some moments not to miss in this film, so pay attention to what is being played out.

This is a journey that can take place in our lives without going where Chuck did for his.

I love this film. It is definitely a portrait of the human experience and a bottom line to take with you. What is the bottom line? Can you find one of your own?

30 December 2000,"Good, but not as amazing as Forrest Gump.","First of all, Tom Hanks is an incredible actor. He exemplifies every movie that he is in, and he has always been one of my favorite actors. Forrest Gump is one of mine & my sisters favorite movies. I expected this to be as good, but I was a little disappointed. Helen Hunt is completely useless in this movie, and her and Hanks have no chemistry at all, so you don't care about their relationship. But Hanks does great on his own. The island scenes are wonderful, and he develops a funny and touching friendship with Wilson, a volleyball. All in all, it is good, but I don't think it will take home a lot of Oscars. Zemeckis and Hanks are great, but before and after the island come up dry. 8/10.

31 March 2001,The real SURVIVOR!,"You know, it would be refreshing to see Tom Hanks take a

couple of years off from movies and do some stage work. He could undeniably

get away with it. He IS 'Cast Away'. There is no other performer in this

film who even holds a candle to him. To work for the better half of this

film stranded on a desert island, Hanks thoroughly convinced me that he WAS

stuck on this island and I had to remind myself from time to time that it

was only a movie. Director Robert Zemeckis stages one of the most realistic

plane crashes I have ever seen and the stillness which fills the last frame

of the movie with a crossroads as its focus is perfectly executed. My only

complaint is that, as much as I enjoyed Hanks alone on the island, I would

have enjoyed periodic flashbacks of his life while stuck alone to develop

his character better to show him more dimensionally and not just as a

survivor and this probably would have propelled the film into my top five.

Oh, well, at least there was Wilson. : - )",

27 January 2020,"Less harrowing than expected, and more whimsically adventerous.","Cast Away was the 6th film unlocked on my 100 movie bucket list gift I received. Its greatest strength is in its pacing. Whenever I was beginning to get bored of what I was seeing, the plot would jump into a whole new segment and recapture my attention. Hanks gives a great performance as usual.

30 September 2012,"good, but not as good as i remember","Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs.

22 January 2001,Cast Power is more like it,"Contrived, overly pompous, predictable, and uncompelling is the best way to describe this overrated film. If you saw the previews for this film, there was really no need to see the movie. In the previews they showed:

A) Tom Hanks as a Fed Ex delivery guy who's girlfriend is Helen Hunt. B) Tom Hanks getting on a plane. C) The plane crashing. D) Hanks stranded on an island, so long he eventually grows a beard. E) Hanks saying he'd ""rather take his chances out there than die here"", as he floats away on a raft. F) Hanks making it back home. G) Hunt running out after him in the rain.

There were no surprises! And it's just so unmoving. He gets off the island and inside you're saying to yourself ""ok, so what?"". The moment after i saw the previews i knew it was gonna suck, but everyone was gonna love it and get all these award nominations just cause it was Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, and Rob Zemeckis. Notice the commercials pitched it with ""Zemeckis and Hanks team up for the first time since Forrest Gump!"" I'd heard the initial concept was Tom Hanks' idea too. That doesn't surprise me. The last time Hanks had an idea for a movie it came out as That Thing You Do!. A word of advice for Tom Hanks: Stick to what you're good at. That's ACTING. Leave the writing to the writers. Not that they got a good one at that for this film. The scenes with the ball and where he starts a fire were just so pompous and overly dramatic. God, i can just see them in the developement process for this film: ""Hey! let's give him a bad tooth in the beginning, so that way we can have him knock it out with an ice skate later!"". How freakin' contrived! The whole time i felt like i was watching a Kevin Costner movie. Self-righteous and absorbed. Basically this was a crap movie that was successful due to star power. Do yourselves a favor and CAST this one AWAY.",1
30 April 2021,Tom Hanks at his Best,"This film is pretty great! I think, the settings, cinematography, costumes, acting and locations all come together perfectly creating an interesting and enjoyable viewing experience. Tom Hanks is an actor I love but this is definitely one of my favourite roles by him and I think the entire cast works well I love how much of the movie doesn't include much dialogue and overall I think this is a film anyone can sit down and enjoy, thoroughly recommend it.

1 February 2001,"Good, but not great","Tom Hanks is king. That's what I think after watching the movie. His transformation is totally amazing: from a very slightly overweight man to the a very skinny person, from a very hard-working employee to a survivor, Tom Hanks simply amazes me.

The crash scene is the most terrifying aircraft footage I've ever seen. The sound effects actually made me feel uncomfortable and nervous. A masterpiece.

Wilson was a great idea.

Sadly, the rest of the film left a lot of issues unexplored. It should have avoided the ""before"" and ""after"" story, instead concentrating on Hanks' loneliness at the island. The ""silent"" part of the movie was the best for me. I could've cared less about his soon to be wife, or his friends at work. It was pretty obvious how all that would finish. Very cliched.

Oh, and if you don't know by now who paid for the movie, watch it. You'll all agree it was FedEx. At one point, I even got to think I was watching an infommercial, where Hanks demonstrated that ""not even being a castaway will stop FedEx from delivering on time!"". Yuck!

Solid 8 stars because of Hanks, the crash scene, and Wilson.",4
15 April 2018,This was Tom Hanks best performance!,"What a wonderful story, and performance. I've watched this several times and it is just so good.

4 August 2021,Experience!!,"Outstanding !!

Tom Hanks and Wilson <3

It's all about love - about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success, about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it, about an ordeal that led one man to re-think what is meaningful in life, and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years.

18 April 2016,This movie holds such a special place in my heart,"Where do I start, I have lost count of the times I have watched this beautiful film. Tom Hanks performance is perfect, but there is more, the overwhelming feeling I am left with at the end of this movie, is that you can overcome anything and what you think you may have lost may not be as good as what you are about to receive. I believe that Helen Hunt's character, came into Chuck's life so that she would simply be his guardian angel through the hell that was the desert island and its isolation, she helped him survive! After his ordeal, he had changed and she had changed, he had become almost worldly and his experience allowed him to become aware of what was really important and what wasn't. She either appeared to have become or perhaps the pure genius of this film made me feel as if she was boring or staid compared to the person Chuck had become. The angel wings on the FedX package, was such a constant throughout the story and I choose to believe that he ends up with the woman at the center of the creation of those wings. The message: people come in and out of our lives for different reasons, we may not know the reason, or we may mourn when they leave or move on, but it is all part of our journey and with a little bit of faith and luck we can all end up where we were supposed to be at journey's end.

The story is well-constructed, and the pivotal performance of Tom Hanks is sterling as always (the man hasn't made a single real clinker in his entire career-even ""Bachelor Party"" and ""The 'Burbs"" were good of their type). But the cumulative impact of the finished product just doesn't attain the level of profundity the filmmakers were shooting for; that ""spark of synergy"" that teases the last 20 minutes or so of the film never catches fire, and one is left ever-so-slightly disappointed.

3 April 2001,"The hell with Robinson Crusoe, go Chuck Noland","This really is a great film, in which Tom Hanks succeeds again in starring in one of the best intro's to a film ever after Saving Private Ryan. The intro was so good, I almost got sick man and that means something. It really was heavy and much better than The Perfect Storm's disaster scenes. The Island part of the movie was also good and the return to home part was good too. Some people hated the ending though, but I liked it. It could have been longer, but it was still good, although I do not like having to make up my own ending. By the way, for people who think that after Chuck gets home, the movie stops, that ain't so and this can never be, bearing in mind the beginning and the fact that the director is Robert Zemeckis. Good fun, go see it.

4 April 2021,Straight 10/10 full house.,"Tom Hanks created this movie, took a year out half way through to lose weight, showed the ultimate in dedication, produced a masterpiece and the story was probably the best in modern day cinema. Pretty much exactly like my life except I haven't been lost at sea. He was free at the end of it to make a choice. He was cast away. No matter what life brings, you never no what the tide brings. Wait until the tide comes in and the sun comes up and just remember to stay breathing - COVID free. This film should be remade it was utterly the best story and quotes ever. Women should learn from this. So should men but. I guess you'll all miss the underlying meaning. I was at a cross roads exactly this way, felt the end of a relationship coming, even dreamt it. Then the reality hits. But, at at the end of the day it doesn't matter because it's always you.

14 July 2001,good movie,"I liked this movie. I thought it was really unique. And bravo to Tom Hanks! I think it takes quite a bit of talent to be able to be the only actor for basically the whole film and still make it work. It was very realistic also. For example, the plane crash was the most realistic ive seen in the movies. I think anyone should see this movie. Its long but its very well made and entertaining.

27 December 2000,Huh?,"I was bored on Christmas Day, so I went down the street to see this film. I had seen an interview between Hanks and Charlie Rose the day before, so my interest was up. While I can appreciate Hanks' talent as an actor, this film left a lot to be desired. First of all, the trailer gives way too much of the plot away, including the fact that Chuck is rescued, and he ends seeing Kelly again (the trailer has enough sense not to give away what Kelly did for the time he was gone). I got that Chuck, being a control freak about time, has to reevaluate when he realizes what little control he has over anything. I even picked up on the use of the Elvis Presley songs in the movie. What was the ultimate lesson he was supposed to get overall? The film is very unclear about that, leaving the audience with an ambiguous ending.

6 September 2008,Guaranteed to shed a tear,"A very good movie, Cast Away, brings to the screen the story of a Fed-Ex employee who is stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean following a plane crash. Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties. Cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength. Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good! In short, Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!

26 December 2000,A movie that chooses the road of superficiality,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I expected a decent look into the challenges of living in utter isolation, having to survive without modern acoutrements, and a lot of reflection on one's place in the universe. Oh no. This film, whenever confronted with the option, chooses the road of superficiality over depth.

Once we get past the deeply Republican yuppie fantasy of ""ideal existence"" and onto the island, we would expect, at least after a while, a little reflection on the part of our protagonist. But, for a film whose star is so eager to declare that ""nothing happens"" in its middle section, we are treated to unending survival tips and adventures at the expense of any reflection. This is a beautiful island, surely anyone there would have some moments of appreciating the stillness and natural wonder of the island. Well, not here. Surely after four years Hanks would have developed his own ways, his own joys and sorrows, new abilities he's proud of, or good at, but we just don't see them. His emotional range remains, for the whole of the island portion of the film, sad and sadder. We're supposed to believe that after he returns to civilization that there's a part of him left on that island-- well, based on this movie, he never really seems to BE on the island, he's always a yuppie visitor, and doesn't seem to engage in his environment. This movie could have been much more powerful if it chose to really engage in the loneliness and despair that one would feel after giving up on civilization and realizing one may be alone for the rest of one's life. Hanks is a fine actor unhampered by vanity, but here what we're seeing is a movie star dropped off on a set every morning. The movie's depth never rises above the level of ""Dude, what if you were like, trapped on an island? Man, like, what would you DO? That would sure suck."" And that's the one statement this film seems to make: being alone in the universe pretty much sucks. Hey, Thanks Tom, you're giving us pearls.

There are a lot of other details that give the film away as a sham. If I was standed on a tropical island, the first thing I would do is look for the resort on the other side. Tom shouts a few ""Hello's,"" then assumes that there's no one there. At one point he climbs up to the summit--at this point a 360-degree pan could have worked wonders, but uh-uh, not here. I still think there's a Club Med a half-mile away that Tom just never bothered to look for. He also never really seems to explore the island--and after four years, don't you think you'd take a little field trip? Also, after four years, wouldn't you have built yourself more than a few spears? Tom can't get off the island because of the reef off the section of beach he refuses to leave--maybe he could have paddled around to see if there was a break in the reef? Oh, I guess not. This is what I mean when I say this film never really engages with the reality of being on the island, and robs itself of the seriousness it so desperately asks of its audience.

I have read a book of true accounts of people stranded on islands (""Great Shipwrecks and Castaways,"" it's still in print, and it's excellent, so look for it if this interests you), and a book on how to survive if you must drift for days on a raft, and I know that the real problem Tom is going to face once his portasan blows away is exposure to the sun. But that problem is apparently not convenient for this film to explore, so it just pretends like it doesn't exist. This film asks you to reflect only on the problems of nature that Hollywood can easily solve, all others simply do not exist.

A SPOILER IN THIS NEXT SECTION: But the real mistake this movie makes, in which it betrays both itself and its audience, is to virtually cancel out ALL emotional resonance it might have attained by having a hot babe appear out of nowhere in the final two minutes to make everything okay. This development is at once disappointing and disgusting. Disappointing in that all the sadness we've built up for Hanks is INSTANTLY ERADICATED by the convenient appearance of a new ""chick"" to make his life complete, disgusting in the suggestion that Helen Hunt's character, who we've built up such a respect and reverence for, can simply be replaced by an almost identical ""hot chick"" (this one has RED hair though! And besides, Hunt never amounted to much anyway). So, as an audience, we are left to assume that Hank's character really IS stupifyingly superficial, and that the only connection he really had to Hunt, all that time on the island, is that he needed some babe in his life. Hunt, or someone else, it doesn't matter. This puts a nasty taste in my mouth now when I think about Hanks and Zemeckis as PEOPLE. But aside from that, I am surprised that they would so completely betray the film they've obviously expended so much effort on.

All in all, a deeply Republican film. It prods us to look deep inside ourselves and ask: ""What would we do if one day we didn't have an SUV and a pager?"" But, the movie says, don't worry about not having a woman around, they're a dime a dozen, and they're all the same.

Bleech!

8 February 2023,Heartwarming,"Tom Hanks being the supreme actor we've come to know did an amazing job- largely carrying the narrative on his own with the support of great writing and direction.

The story is literally in the title. But what is amazing is how the film goes beyond the narrative of a man stuck on an island by himself. It speaks to survival, courage and determination in the face of a major crisis in this man's life.

Of course you have to find some humour in the whole situation, and the director does a fine job at finding light in the darkness and make you smile as new situations arise. I strongly recommend this film.

15 September 2002,For those who didn't get it,"It's sad -but not surprising- to hear people complaining that this movie is boring or long. This is a simple yet effective story about a man on a deserted island. In fact, this isn't even an island; it's a big rock.

Now I know that 90% of the audience expected some action on this island. You know maybe a huge bear, or a lion, or a tiger attacking Tom Hanks. Well as I said, it was a rock.

'Cast Away' is a move about a man staying alone on a rock for four year, helpless. So if you strip man from all the technology and society what do you have? Can this creature survive and exceed its limitations?

Zemeckis did a tremendous job, so did Hanks. The environment is suffocating and beautiful at the same time. Tom Hanks succeeds at making this character believable. You can feel the struggle inside, trying to stay sane with no one else to talk to.

This is a triumph of man and a lyrical projection of the power within.

Best movie of 2000.

29 April 2017,Tragic Romance/Drama/Adventure,"The sheer genius of this script has unfortunately been overlooked by many. First of all, this is indeed, a Romance genre, but it is more of Drama genre, with Adventure as the spine for the Desire Line. And further, this is Tragic Romance: Oh! What could have been! The Hero's Desire in the beginning of the story is to be a workaholic, and by the way, he's also getting married to a great girl. The script does not dwell on the Romance genre from the first few pages – Therefore, the audience doesn't have a vested interest in the Hero and his love interest despite the fact that their very meet-up is the Inciting Incident of the story. We also see, from the very first scene, the symbolic importance of ""time,"" which is ironic, as the Opening Story World is barren, empty, almost as if time has no beginning or end here – Very symbolic use of Story World for the writer. This ""time"" element portends for what lies ahead in Act 2, on a desert island where ""time"" no longer has any significance. The genius of writing this Story World is that man must find beauty no matter where he is: Noticing the stars, the flashing lights of the moon, the red/brown of the Tennessee clay, the clapboard houses set off in the setting sun, the isolation on an island that is barren, yet lush with vegetation. How difficult it is when man must survive and bleed and make mistakes as the Hero of this story does – All to survive, which is the new Desire Line beginning in Act 2. To write a Hero in an adventure/drama/romance story, the decision must be made as to which genre should be primary. In the case of Cast Away, the writer decided on Drama and Romance as the Designing Principle, and Adventure for the spine of the plot. The Hero's Desire is to find a way to survive and get rescued. The island is both his savior and his prison. He understands this, as time goes by. The photo of his great love is also his savior and his prison, as he knows he will probably never see her again. Adventure is a sub-plot of Action. However, this is not an Action story by any means. In Action genre, the Hero must think ""on his feet"" and engage in action at every turn. Honor is the driving force behind an action Hero. The elements of Drama override the Action genre here though – There is a very strong moral dilemma in Drama genre. The characters are intimate and the Opponent is also a known entity, as opposed to Myth, whereby the Hero encounters dragons and slays them, one after another. In Cast Away, the Hero says that he even tried to hang himself at one point, but true to form, after he tested the bough, it broke and even his attempt to kill himself was not in his power. The Premise of a story for film should include three elements: The Hero; the Inciting Incident; and the Hero's Desire line. So the Inciting Incident should have been the plane crash, if Adventure (sub-plot of Action) were the genre that took precedence. But the Inciting Incident is when the Hero and the love of his life meet up during the Christmas holiday, thus taking from the Hero a break in the concept of time that means so much to him in the beginning of his Character Arc. So the screenwriter made a very important decision: The Romance genre, key to the Designing Principle, is really the key to the plot of this story, as opposed to the Adventure/Action genre. But the Hero's Desire Line is in sync with the Adventure/Action genre. The fact that his Desire is also to be reunited with the love of his life is the moral dilemma that he has always faced for the better part of his life. So herein lies the genius of this story: Sometimes a love that keeps us alive might have to be given up due to life's circumstances. There is a story element called a Double Reversal in Romance genre: Both the Hero and his great love do a reversal from where they were emotionally in the beginning of the story. We see this in a very powerful way in Cast Away. Both characters have a moral epiphany and then a Self-Revelation that has most of us in tears because this is a cathartic experience for anyone who has ever loved and then lostThe genius of the writer was to have the FedEx employee whose wife was dying of cancer as the Hero's audience, while the Hero is telling in exposition before the Moral Epiphany and Climax scene what the Designing Principle of this story was really all about. About the use of Wilson, the volleyball, as a character: Obviously, to craft a story with a Hero on a desert island would be a challenge. Because in film, as opposed to novel, the audience needs to know what's in the character's mind- what his feelings are- his emotions, etc. So the Point of View Character, also called an Ally serves this purpose. The writer came up with the idea of Wilson, the volleyball, so the Hero would have someone to emote to and thereby express his feelings to the audience in a believable way. Again, the cathartic emotions we feel are that if we were stranded on a desert island and we had the ingenuity to craft a ""volleyball friend,"" we would absolutely do it!",9

16 August 2022,An absolute classic.,"One of my favorite movies and probably my favorite Tom Hanks performance.

It was genius of Zemeckis to not use a musical score during the scenes on the island. It adds to the immersion and that feeling of being present on this island with Chuck. There is something extremely reflective and meditative about Cast Away that I haven't quite seen in another film. Ultimately this movie can lead you to questions about your own life and I cannot commend a movie enough for provoking these types of thoughts.

One of the most emotional movies of all time. Incredible themes as well.

But why do I get that irritated? This movie is just too long and whatever happened to the perfect movie lenght of 1.30 h? Even if it would be shortened with an hour it's still too long as nothing really makes the story bind together and from a promising start there's just short cuts for almost two and a half hour with beautiful photage but that's not enough to keep me interested.

A weak 4 star movie not recommended to anyone except for having Tom Hanks in the leading or maybe I should say only part.

2 November 2020,"Been wanting to see this movie for year, finally did, and was left with an ehh impression.","When it comes to Tom Hanks while I will give him his dues because he is a great actor. Some of his movies for me I either loved, hated, or it was somewhere in the middle. Thats where this one falls in my opinion.

Pros:

-The visuals for a movie of its era are great. Especially when it comes to the water, island, etc.

-Tom Hanks did great job acting in this film. He was beliveble and made you very enthralled with his pain and agony throughout as man struggling to survive

-Without giving to much away the movie is very touching and emotional. Makes you do alot personal deep thinking about quite few things.

Cons:

-This complaint I've seen from quite few people as well. The middle of the movie gets very boring and draggy after while.

-I thought the movie could used more scenes about his life as opposed to excess of ones they did on the island. While it did show some personal background it wasn't enough in my opinion.

-The ending I felt was abrupt and wasn't fan of. I know some people enjoyed it but after all that I just wanted little more out of it.

Overall would I recommend this movie? Definitely depends on type of movie goer you are if you're someone whos into deep acting and good story yes you'll enjoy this film. If you're someone who is hard to entertain and gets bored easyly stay far far away from this film.",7
4 March 2005,Cast it away,"This movie is really hard to criticize mostly because not much is happening.

The whole plot seem to be this stranded guy misses his fiancé and his love keeps him going, bot lo and behold he is for 2nd deserted when he returns and gets stranded on the plains of America this time along with a symbol of Americn consumerism - an off-roader.

The only time some real cinematography is on the verge of breaking out (probably an oversigt by the director) is the first camera motions which lends itself from North by Northwest by the great master.

I can truthfully state that this was about the dullest film I have ever been unfortunate to witness. I see no dramatic storyline, no depth of character, no development, only a captain's log of things the stranded fellow does to survive, none of which is even original apart from the dental operation (Don't try it at home) Imagine the great monologues the main character could have given in the depth of the Pacific night elaborating with newly gained wisdom like an Indian hermit.

Helen Hunt does a fine job creating a character though but the exhaustion of blowing life into the shallow script takes the better of her and she faints. Probably what the director conceives of a climax.

The movie is going nowhere as was the stranded fellow, and it is all rounded symbolically up by Hanks returning to the point he started, only with a loss of 4 wasted years. He was lucky. The spectator wastes 2 fine hours.

I can only say: Avoid this Scyllian reef at all cost and cast it away if the movie strands on your coast.",1
27 December 2000,How does he keep doing it?,"Tom Hanks has done it again. He's got another movie that allows him to pull out the stops and show us what a true star can do with a good story.

Hollywood pours out schlock by the barrel, but not this time. ""Cast Away"" is destined to become one with classics like ""Casablanca"", ""Gone With The Wind"", etc. - the kind of movie that when you say the title, it just sends a chill up your spine, it's so good.

Go see this movie several times. I've already seen it three times and each time, there's something new that you didn't see the previous times.

And say a prayer for poor Wilson, would you?

18 January 2022,Utterly Depressing,"This was a long and tragic movie. It's harrowing and dark. It's not something I particularly enjoyed watching - someone living in isolation for four years straight on a deserted island, with no human contact and only himself and a few meagre Fed Ex packages for survival. The moments on the island were hard to get through because of how real and bleak they seemed.

This is the same reason, though, why this movie is so good. It forces us to come to terms with our humanity and that comparable comfort we live in and take for granted. This movie overwhelmed me with a feeling of gratitude for my situation. It's moments like these, when you witness true adversity, that you realize that all those times you argued over petty nonsense were a waste of everyone's time, and disrespectful to your life and your personal purpose for being on this planet.

This movie will serve as an awakening for many people and for that alone it deserves a high score. Now, the actual content wasn't that exciting. When you're alone on a deserted island there's only so much you can do, but I was impressed with Chuck's improvisation skills. It was interesting to see him escape a once doomed situation and slowly gain momentum and faith that some day he might escape, against all odds.

And he does just that. And it's glorious to watch. It's nail biting and tense. The only part of this movie I felt wasn't so well done was the ending. Instead of seeing Chuck slowly adjust back to his old life, it seems like he never left to begin with. By the time he's on the plane back to America he seems perfectly normal, although a bit pensive. Quite a departure from how he was when we was rescued. Four weeks elapses from the point he was rescued and in my opinion it would have been more interesting to watch his reintegration and socialization back into normal society through therapy and the various supports they could offer him.

His relationship with Kelly was also troubling because it's unresolved. Does he get back with her or does she stay with her new husband and family? It's hard to say. Questions remain unanswered, but for the most part this movie is well done and exciting to watch so the problematic ending isn't the end of the world...",8

29 May 2020,Outstanding !!,"Tom Hanks and Wilson <3

It's all about love - about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success, about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it, about an ordeal that led one man to re-think what is meaningful in life, and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years.

Tom Hanks is superb as Chuck Noland - creating immense sympathy for an ordinary guy trapped - not against his will - in a job that is eating him alive. How many actors could have made Noland's attachment to ""Wilson"" believable? Yet Hanks does.

Everything about it works, the cinematography, the locations, the acting, the story and this is Robert Zemeckis' greatest showpiece. Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing. The story is so well written in its simplicity, and Helen Hunt and Hanks have amazing chemistry. It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together. I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile!",8

26 December 2000,"Absolutely, positively ho-hum","Greetings again from the darkness. I feel cheated. A great actor, first rate director, monster budget, the Dreamworks production team and a tropical island, and all that results is a two and a half hour commercial for FedEx. Is this where our movies are headed? Tom Hanks should feel cheated too. He takes a year off to lose weight and grow hair, and he gets to throw a spear and lay on a wooden raft. Please. On a positive note, Zemekis does provide us with a wonderfully executed plane crash sequence. I felt like I was THERE as Hanks struggles for air. Hanks has developed into a remarkable actor. In the few scenes with other people, his skills overwhelm every one of them - including Helen Hunt. Why the need to skip FOUR years? The cheap stunt to make us feel Hanks' desperation from the previous year could easily have been a remarkable scene in the movie. My tidbit on this one involves Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx playing himself in one scene. Was this his price to have his company's brand stamped all over this film? Or did he receive endorsement funds and have his ego stroked? Overall, this is a very mediocre movie, that proves with enough money, even mediocrity can be slickly filmed.",6

9 August 2021,Censored Film,"I watched this movie on satellite TV about 15 years ago and distinctly remember the dramatic scene where Hanks character attempts suicide and fails. This was his emotional low point of the cast away ordeal and turning point in his determination to survive. Now I watch the movie and this dramatic scene is gone! So it appears the censors removed the defining dramatic climax of the movie, perhaps for religious reasons, who knows. You know it doesn't work for me to watch a movie one year and see one version and then later see that it has been shortened. Without the attempted suicide scene, it is not the same movie. It doesn't take you anywhere emotionally so ends up being just another movie. For that reason, I don't recommend watching this movie. You are being had. The movie was a 10 and now is about a 7.

24 January 2001,Hanks' Tour de Force,"Just saw this movie a couple of hours ago. Let me get straight to the point. This movie is not good, it isn't bad either but it doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. The first part (introducing the character(s)). We meet Tom and Helen, Tom is a sleazeball yuppie who only cares about his job, Helen euh... has no character. I didn't care about either one. The second part (plain crash) this was good, but not as good as the ""ALIVE"" plain crash, but it had it's moments. The third part(Tom only on island part 1). This is were the problems lie. It's very very slow, it's all about the nature cinematography (if you want to see this, please rent or buy THE THIN RED LINE) it was nicely done but not perfect. Tom Hanks is a good actor, but I simply do not care if, I know he is alone on the island, I know he will make a fire, I know he will learn to break coconuts, I know he will make an imaginary friend, (all seen in the trailer), but there's NOTHING more. This trailer ruined the entire film. That's why this part is very boring. The third part (Tom on island 4 years later and escaping). This part I enjoyed, we see a man who was spend 4 years of his life alone, of course he's cracking up, wouldn't you, but this part isn't long enough, In the beginning we only see the first weeks/months of his solitude, if you really want to see character development it had to be spread out more over the years, not only the first and last month. The last part(Tom and Helen meet again) some good parts (his sleeping on the floor/his disinterrest for being wet and the towel he gets) but mainly bad parts. The dialogue with ""Stan"" for not being with him when his wife died, and the scenes with Helen Hunt. So what do we got : Tom Hanks' role was good (oscar-nominated worthy, not winning) and another Robert Zemeckis film I just didn't get a real good feeling about.(Forrest Gump and Death Becomes Her being the others)",6

5 June 2005,Engaging and very powerful,"Cast Away is the sort of film that filmmakers should be striving to give their audiences more often. While it's not wholly original, and influences from the classic Robinson Crusoe story especially shine through, we haven't seen all that many films of this nature in recent years and therefore this is a refreshing yarn. Tom Hanks stars as the businessman unlucky enough to find himself stranded, all alone, on an island in the middle of nowhere. Completely cut off from any kind of society, our hero must do all he can to survive the elements that he has found himself in. Unlike most films that we've seen Hanks in before, this performance is very much of a physical nature, and his lack of dialogue gives the actor a very different feel to what he usually evokes from the audience. Tom Hanks had to work hard to give this performance, as the role requires a lot of hard work; but he's risen to the challenge excellently, and this movie has given me more respect for the actor I, at one time, didn't have any respect for at all.

The way that Robert Zemeckis draws us into the protagonist's plight is really well done, and throughout the movie you almost feel like you are marooned on the island as well. I was sat transfixed with the action on screen, and my viewing of this movie marks one of the most engaging I've ever had in my film watching career. It's amazing how Hanks can be sat talking to a volleyball with grass stuck to it's head and have the audience engrossed in the action. Ironically, Hanks talking to a volleyball was much more interesting than any conversations he had with real actors in movies such as Philadelphia and Apollo 13. The film is very realistic throughout, and this helps the movie no end when it comes to drawing the audience in as this could very much be a documentary feature of a true story; such is the realism of the picture. It comes across most evidently in the scenes that see Hanks writhe in pain after gashing his leg on a stray rock in the ocean. We actually FEEL his pain, and that is testament to the power of this movie. It took me five years to finally catch this film, and even then it was only by accident. If I was you and I hadn't seen this film yet, I'd do so ASAP.",8
10 December 2007,An Unbelievable Tale of Life and Survival,"If you haven't seen this movie, you have no idea how a ""one man"" movie in a single island can move your mind and emotions like the way it will. Tom Hanks, by far, the greatest actor as i can say, and it's his mezmerizing performance that has made this movie an epic tale. The out-takes, background composition, the greater Philosophy about life and tale of human being, fighting against nature, with only will power to live and survive -- it's unbelievable .. If 10 is the highest rating, this movie deserves 15 .. sorry that i can't rate it more than 10 .. but .. neways, i won't say anything else .. just see it and you will be blown away with the wind...

I thought the story was incredible, the direction as well and Tom Hanks' performance is phenomenal. At no point in the film I found it boring, it always kept me hooked, it has several emotional, happy, sad, surprising and hopeful moments.

I loved the film, it makes me reflect and understand the value of our life, a story that shows that we can move forward with our life.

11 December 2021,I'll be right back,"A Fed Ex employee survives a plane crash and is stranded on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean.

This is a strong piece of visual storytelling with a good performance from Tom Hanks.

One character stuck on and island for the majority of a film's running time shouldn't really work, but the portrayal of Chuck's situation and his battle against nature and loneliness are compelling to watch. There is a strong theme about dealing with loss and moving on with life throughout the movie and it's tackled very well.

Everything is tightly focussed from his perspective, starting with the crash that is suitably terrifying in its depiction, especially for any viewers with a fear of flying. The realisation that he is stranded and unlikely to be rescued never really hits home for the first hour of the film as he tackles one compelling obstacle after another.

I cannot really go into anymore detail about plot and scenes without spoiling, but it's safe to say that the character goes through a very difficult journey right up to virtually to the final scene.

Visually it is fabulous with very little needing to be said due to the physical performance of Hanks and what the camera shows us. The focus on several objects that link to previous scenes and memories is brilliant. Also, the idea of the unopened package is great.

There are some typically Hollywood, overly dramatic, simplistic moments, such as the speech Chuck gives toward the end that explains everything but generally I think it's a strong film. It held my 5 year old daughter for the majority of the running time, which is always impressive in my eyes.

Helen Hunt is excellent in her supporting scenes and makes you feel for the position her character is in.

For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",9

20 February 2001,Product placement running rampant,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

When a product or service is blatantly being shown in a movie,the patronism of it is generally going to rile you.Fed-Ex is a relatively new company struggling up off the ground,and trying to get it across to the audience in a major Hollywood Tom Hanks production would seem like the right way to go about attracting a big scale audience.To those unaware of the implementation,it comes and goes,but to those who can see through the cracks ,you are in a position to remind that the trailers were on before the film,not during it.

The rest of Cast Away is certainly a film on it's own.It's hauntingly told ,with theme music conspicuously absent throughout it's majority,and Hanks himself not speaking a word, adding to the eerie stillness of it.The start of the plane crash injects a sudden sharp shock to the system,and his tribulations on the island are quite involving.

However,for a 12 certificate movie,certain members of the audience shouldn't have had to endure the DIY dentistry scene involving the ice skate,and it ultimately emerges as predictable that when he assures his fiance he'll 'be right back'something is just bound to go disastrously wrong.

Still,it's praiseably original and it's ultimately his life after coming off the island that causes it to linger in the memory more.While the final scenes may drag on in the duration,you strangely want them to be longer on leaving.***",

5 October 2016,One Man Show,"This film is very interesting because it shows a story of survival, in ""Robinson Crusoe"" style, something not very common in movies. It consists of a deep psychological drama, which brilliantly explores the despair, depression, the need to survive in extremely harsh conditions, homesickness, loneliness. If we add to these features the particularity of the film has virtually only one character during most of the time (Helen Hunt plays an essential role in the plot but appears very little), could be expected a film absolutely still and lifeless. But it's not the case. The film uses the psychological ups and downs of Chuck (the main character, played by Tom Hanks) to keep moving and avoid dead times, finding space for great moments of tension and hilarious moments of humor. Hanks is a highly capable and talented actor, able to suck his character to the bone and do a first class job, truly chameleonic. Literally, Hanks carries the film with the back thanks to this superb performance. The sets and shooting locations are also worth a positive word.

31 December 2000,"Bad, pointless film","CAST AWAY - MINI REVIEW

PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF MY COMMENTS MAY GIVE AWAY CERTAIN PLOT LINES OF THE FILM.

Cast Away could have been a great film -- but it turned out to be a real disappointment for me. The plane crash and the subsequent challenge of surviving on an isolated island was quite fascinating. The problem was that the relationship between the Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt characters wasn't well established. It seemed forced and rather phony. One minute Hanks' character is calling his lover from Russia, in a rather matter-of-fact tone, telling her he loves her. He barely turns off the cell-phone and he's back at his high-stress job. If only the director had given him even a few seconds to dwell on his recent conversation with someone he is supposed to be madly in love with. I just never bought the love story aspect of it, so when he returns after being stranded on a tiny, deserted island for over four years I just didn't care about her or their relationship. Far too much time had passed, both in real life, and in the movie. Having Hanks stare at tiny fading photo of her just didn't work. I think Helen Hunt is a fine actress, but her tom-boyish looks don't do much for my libido. And if the audience can't feel what the protagonist is supposed to be feeling, well -- it just doesn't work does it?

I also couldn't understand why the movie dragged on for so long after his rescue. The film would have been much better if it had ended at that point.

The scene when the freighter glided by his raft was fabulous.

There were a lot of great scenes in this movie, but they didn't lead up to anything dramatically. His relationship with Wilson, the volleyball provided the most tender moments in the film. Wilson should be nominated for best supporting actor. Sure his acting was a bit stiff at times, but it was better than the mushy acting that preceded Hank's disappearance and certainly much better than the absurd acting and dialogue we had to endure in the aftermath of his rescue.

Maybe I was expecting too much after reading all the great press.

All in all -- a real disappointment.",3
20 January 2022,Adventure...,"""Cast Away"" is an Adventure - Drama movie in which we watch a man working for FedEx arriving on a remote island after a crash landing. He has to find a way in order to survive while he has to remain sane and in a good physical condition.

I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot and it contained also plenty of in tense moments that made the movie even more interesting. The interpretation of Tom Hanks who played as Chuck Noland was simply outstanding and he made the difference and elevated the movie. His story and his interpretation made us relate to him and follow him on his journey. Lastly, I have to say that ""Cast Away"" is an interesting movie and I recommend everyone to watch it.

25 December 2000,Melodramatic bunk... This film was a waste of time and money...,"As usual Tom Hanks is cast in a film that merits little or no acting skill and this film is no exception. If you thought he overacted in his previous films you aint seen nothing yet! This film by comparison makes Bosom Buddies actually seem good with its predictable plot turns and sappy dramatics. If you want to see a really good film in the vein of this dissapointment, rent Hell in the Pacific(1968) with Lee Marvin and the incomparable Toshiro Mifune Or Papillon (1973) starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Both of these films excel where this flick falls short (in particular they actually have good actors in them...)and neither has to use a mega budget to compensate for rushed cinematics and cliche plot. If you like Hanks and his overated acting style then by all means see this movie, you WONT be dissapointed. But on the other hand if you prefer movies of substance stay FAR AWAY from CAST AWAY.

3 July 2016,Don't cast this one away,"I like how Hollywood takes gambles with films from small or simple scenarios. Sometimes they don't always work. Examples of this as successes are Phone Booth or My Dinner With Andrew. There are a couple of moments that suck or don't work in Cast Away, as with Hank's make believe friend, Wilson (a volleyball with a face or was it on a shaved coconut?) where it gets in quite pathetic waters. Hanks in a deservedly nominated role, plays driven non slack ass Fed Ed boss, Chuck Nolan, with solid conviction. He makes one two many deliveries via plane. Towards the end, he says to girlfriend Hunt, who he loses after a four year absence, ""I should of never got on that plane"". He was right, but of course then, we wouldn't have a movie. When his transport Fed Ex plane, goes downs in the Pacific, en route to some place, he being the lone survivor (another Fed ex passenger, that being ex Aussie soap star, Vince Martin) he washes up on shore, with a few scattered Fed Ex boxes, one that apparently saved his life. Another has a brand new pair of ice skates, and you don't want to know how, he utilizes them later. Hanks pulls off the role beautifully with the business of the actor, who given so much opportunity to live this movie, if in the real situation where he has to get his bearings, and fend for himself, sometimes subjecting himself to real agony (you might want to reschedule your dentist after seeing this) The plane crash sequence was thrillingly well done, where there are some real nasty moments, and some really big waves too, amidst a killer thunderstorm, some heavy blood shed prefore. What too I also liked about the film, was the moments Hanks shares with girlfriend, Hunt over Christmas, and a little of the inner conduct and aptitude when working for Fed Ex. And also, I liked the after (probably the best part of the film) where Hanks returns, where it was not all roses and a sad realization came to light which in reality, made sense. Hanks blown opportunity to go off with a redheaded hottie, well that didn't make sense. On the whole Cast Away, is another of these great films about the triumph of the human spirit against the most impossible of odds. A wonderfully put together, inspiring, well shot, and scripted movie, with attention to realistic survival themes of our hero survivor. The CU whale scene is beautifully shot and many a wondrous sight. Hate Hank's beard too, but you'll never forget Wilson.",9
22 May 2019,Silent Drama!,"The movie has many emotional part and struggling in the lifetime. 'Wilson,Wilson I am sorry' the best emotional part of the movie. When the actor is TOM HANKS. Then the movie will always be a masterclass.

17 April 2020,"hopE, hoPE, hOPE and HOPE","Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",10
23 April 2002,Fed-Ex delivers package way too late,"Very good drama with Hanks doing a superb job of convincing the viewer he is all alone with only a ball for company. I liked the way the film ended exactly where it began with Hanks looking down a long stretch of highway. I was left wondering if he would go on ahead or turn back. Great picture: terrific finale.

12 January 2005,Stinks like a guy who hasn't bathed in 4 years,"Zemeckis is the purveyor of some pretty stinky cheese. This movie wasn't as bad as Forrest Gump (there ahould be a 0 for films like this) but it's close. While Forrest Gump is a testament to how ridiculous the Academy Awards are, Castaway is a monolith marking the turning point where feature films become just a vehicle for product placement. Like the Daniel Defoe novel it was based on (the first novel in the English language) it is a homage to capitalism. The Puritan ideals of Robinson Crusoe, where man's worth in the world is determined by his wealth, is modernized in Castaway and gives us a glimpse of the worthlessness of American values and the films made there. This movie is horrible. The values it expresses are horrible but thank Satan it is not another Forrest Gump. A solid 1 out of 10.

19 March 2018,Roots of everything,"The movie that will tell you everything that you did not know about roots of life, of humanity, of religion...Chack Nolland human being suddenly exposed to dramatic anger of Nature's forces in spite of all cruelty of the circumstances keeps and shows his humanity in every smallest detail. The message and the revealing of the movie is outstanding: humans are specific beings that have by their nature the need for love, for building of memories, for believe in salvation... The loss of volleyball Wilson (aka the shadow of Chack's own personality, to the Yung's psychology ) is symbolic deliberation after which he finally founds salvation (the Sheep that founds Chack in deep Sea after he lost every hope) that is in a matter of fact ultimate Bible's message: loose everything and you will be saved... The movie that leaves me deeply touched for days after each watching...If you are ready to meet your soul, you must see this movie...

5 January 2001,Vastly Overrated,"What is so good about this film that critics and moviegoers alike insist that is deserves not only the praise it's getting, but Oscar nominations? I can only conclude that, sadly, it was such a poor overall year for quality films that we're all so desperate as to rate a below average movie much higher than it deserves.

Aside from the fact that the story was nothing more than a dull, overlong, contrived piece that was supposed to be something about 'time', it was just bad filmmaking. Frankly I think the little P.O.V. shot of the package near the beginning of the movie was one of the most annoying shots that I've seen in a long time. Just what did that accomplish that a simple closeup of the package wouldn't have. Follow the package in extreme CU if you must, but please, a package, nor the hand of the delivery man, has eyes for us to see through! Unless for some reason there was supposed to be a camera strapped to the package.

Granted, there is some nice cinematography in the film as well, but it is overshadowed by the sheer lack of any real coherent storyline. Someone else said it best - Tom Hanks gets stranded and suddenly he's a man without a brain. FOUR YEARS??? It didn't cross his mind to build a boat before then? I hope I don't get stuck on an island with Chuck Noland, thank you. Why all the silly gaps in time? The film would have been much more interesting had we actually seen what he went through in order to survive for that long. (hmmm, think the screenwriter couldn't come up with much for him to do over the course of four years, and if he built a raft right away then the movie would be cut in half... so hey, just put in a long passage of time with a title card and everything is solved?)

It pains me to see a film like this getting so much praise. Yes, it has been a bad year for movies, but there were some good ones too. High Fidelity, Gladiator... heck, even Mission Impossible II was a better made film than Cast Away. Here's hoping 2001 is better, so maybe audiences will start expecting a little more from their movies.",1
5 April 2020,like,"After reviewing this classic film, I can't feel the loneliness in that environment and the strong desire for survival. For the most loved person, he insisted to survive, but also for the most loved person, he finally chose to leave, his life is full of perseverance, reason and open-minded. Tomorrow, the sun will still rise, do not know what the tide will bring! Each of us has his own Wilson, whether life is hard or not, always silently accompany you! Four years later he put the faded parcel back on the farm and stood at the fork of the road as if it were a thousand turns of life, but suddenly. Leave the island to return to life, although missed love, but I believe he has a new direction.

3 March 2001,Desert Yourself With This One!,"Just sit right back up and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fatal trip. That started on a Fed Ex plane that took a big slip. The only survivor was a mighty Fed Ex man. The ball was round and bored. They set on shore in a deserted island for a four-year tour. A four-year tour. Ok! So maybe it did not have the crazy antics of `Gilligan's Island.' However, `Cast Away' is the one-man show film of the century. We have Mr.Tom Hanks to thank for that. Strand yourself with `Cast Away.' **** Good

9 January 2023,"""Cast Away"" is a classic, with an exceptional message of courage and resilience in times of isolation. A standing ovation to Tom Hanks and Zemeckis once more!","Just the fact that ""Cast Away"", by Robert Zemeckis, is a film that takes place most of the time on the beach of a desert island, where a single and lonely man tries to survive, should already have been reason enough for the general public to watch it. Would have found it boring. Contrary to expectations, the feature film starring Tom Hanks not only became a huge success with the public and critics, but is already one of the great North American classics of the 2000s. Masterpiece - Forrest Gump - years before, is due to a combination of factors. But the main one I still think is the impeccable rhythm of the second act, despite elements that are not very palatable to the common spectator, such as the total absence of a soundtrack and action scenes.

The story of ""Cast Away"" is well put together, divided into three segments that portray different situations. Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a systems engineer at FedEx, who is obsessed with punctuality and work. This ends up affecting his social commitments a little, in particular his relationship with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), who, even though they are about to get married, Chuck's busy schedule always interferes. On a Christmas occasion, Chuck interrupts the party to solve a problem in Malaysia, leaving everything behind, but promising his beloved that he will be back soon.

During the flight in a violent storm, the plane where Chuck is crashes in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and he is the only survivor for having managed, before the collision with the water, to improvise an inflatable raft, but which loses all and any electronic equipment. . Ocean waves take you to a deserted island, where there is nothing but nature. And it is in this part that the film walks through a perfectly conducted narrative, where only the main actor is on the scene, and this lasts for more than an hour and a half, and this time is equivalent in the film to four long years in which the character he finds himself lost and isolated in that place, without any contact with anyone. But this hour and a half into the movie will show how Chuck adapts to nature.

Tom Hanks' talent prevails, making the protagonist's experience believable enough for the public to be truly interested in him and not in a silly caricature of a castaway. Note how Chuck Noland never makes the difficulties he goes through a reason for unbearable drama or tears in bulk. What matters is the most primitive experience of the protagonist, involving his survival and his health, not only physical but also mental. The screenplay by William Broyles Jr. Takes care to craft situations that empathize with Noland rather than pity him. We hope for the character's survival, but we don't sympathize with him as an inert victim unable to react to chance. This general tone is profoundly important in the cohesiveness of the work. Otherwise, the outcome of Cast Away could never have gone the way it did.

Hanks gives Chuck the air of an honest man who hasn't always made the right choices. Valuing his career more than the time he has in life, the character was so dedicated to his professional competence that the rest was levitating in expectations that were never fulfilled. And the actor intones each micro expression in an always blunt way, showing Chuck's regrets in relation to lost time, poorly used. Something that only the absolute isolation gave him, ironically, time to reflect. The actor's delivery was so great that the filming had to be divided into two parts: the first, in which Chuck is healthy and the actor, with his normal kilos; the second to represent the character in ""survival mode"", with 20 kilos less.

In this sense, the ellipse proposed by the script is also fundamental when jumping from the first to the last year of the protagonist on the island. In addition to avoiding the slowness of the narrative and the complete loss of rhythm, the option of Broyles Jr. Surprises the audience with the enormous evolution of the character - from the shipwrecked man who learned to make fire with sticks and eat raw fish, to the man who is fully adapted to his new world. Zemeckis' direction is also spot on. The raccord that rhymes fire and water (two elements dear to the new reality) stand out and transitions to a closed shot over a fish. A harpoon hits him in the face and the camera performs a tilt to show that the one who hunted him was a new Chuck Noland - with enormous beard and hair and recorded by a medium shot that affirms him as a kind of scrawny hero à la Robinson Crusoe. Here Zemeckis leaves no room for doubt - his protagonist acts on reality. He changes it and changes with it.

The crash of the FedEx plane, which put the protagonist in a situation never imagined, is the perfect hybris to disturb the notion of time in Cast Away. Noland is only compelled to react against a new reality and to change profoundly in the face of it, because everything he had known has suddenly disappeared. Nothing could be more disturbing for a top official in a huge postal company, obsessed with the idea of speed and order. That was his job - optimizing time - and his personal life followed equally strict guidelines and deadlines, since the wedding with his fiancée Kelly (Hellen Hunt) was already perfectly underway. But the tragic dimension of existence (without any Nietzschean pedantry) was placed between Chuck Noland and his plans and that is why the treatment that the film as a whole gives him is so dignified by making him a factotum of his own paths. Noland, reclusive on the island, metaphorizes his own existence, since his loneliness in every decision is the loneliness of all of us. He will be solely responsible for his own survival over 1500 days.

But the idea of responsibility, so well-crafted in ""Cast Away"", does not exclude the other. This is evident in the figure of the most famous inanimate object in the history of cinema - the Wilson volleyball. As a gregarious being, Chuck Nolan finds himself in need of human presence (or at least personified). But anyone who sees Wilson as just a character (why not use the term?) who serves him as a companion to assuage loneliness is wrong. The humanized ball becomes everything another human being would be - it is where Tom Hanks' character channels his affection, but also with whom he argues, for whom he cries with regret when he offends and throws him overboard in a fit of fury and for those who feel responsible for having to let go on the high seas. The other appears as an imperative in ""Cast Away"". It appears as an anchor for love and as a genealogy for conflicts. Anyway, necessary.

The character's escape offers a nice hint as to what the outcome will be. It is through the adaptation of the protagonist to his new environment that he even comes to know the behavior of the tides. In a rare moment of low tide, he throws himself into the sea together with Wilson and manages to overcome the waves that challenged his advance. In a story so fond of themes like time, chance and individual responsibility, nothing more natural than the character's salvation would come by his own hands. The low tide appears as an allegory of opportunities. It is through the combination of fortuna (opportunity granted by the sea) and virtù (the protagonist's long preparation to overcome it) that the character achieves his greatest objective. The sequence in which the protagonist wins this battle is harrowing, but rewarding.

Robert Zemeckis, as already mentioned, is a huge differential in this production. Here, he turns the plane crash into a true cinematic exercise, utilizing the catastrophic scenario brilliantly, as Hanks intones the desperation of someone trying to survive. The darkness exalts the sound of the propellers hitting the sea, while the flashes show the viewer the state of calamity inside what was once a plane. In addition, the director makes the life of a single man on an island something tense, very similar to what was done, years later, in ""Into the Wild"" and ""Gravity"", as loneliness changes the sanest mind. Thus, the effort to survive, both in this film and in the examples cited, make overcoming something memorable for those who accompany it, but above all for those who conquer it. And seeing Chuck Noland's pain in this feature is the credit that Zemeckis' direction deserves, creating a completely friendly atmosphere in the first act to then shatter the main character's expectations - and the viewer, as a result.

Despite making all the right choices in the long sequence set on the desert island, he is visibly lost at the conclusion of the plot, as if he no longer has any interest in what is about to happen (which is understandable, since the ending created by screenwriter William Broyles is , mediocre at best). Be that as it may, Zemeckis should be applauded for his smart (and courageous) decision not to supplement the second act of Cast Away with a soundtrack - something that any other filmmaker would end up doing (and what's worse: possibly that score would end up being awarded). By silently following Chuck's misadventures, the director intensifies even more the feeling of loneliness conveyed by the film, which demonstrates his intelligence. By the way, the great photography by Don Burgess must be highlighted, which precisely highlights the beauty of the island where the story was filmed.

""Cast Away"" is an experience of contemplative cinema from the early 2000s, something that has become increasingly rare with the almost frenetic montage adopted by cinema. Celebrating the talent of a team that deserves every applause, the result is only not perfect due to the excesses of the second act and the conclusion that certainly did not please everyone, although totally understandable. Even so, it deserves to be visited for its exceptional message of courage and resilience in times of isolation.",8
9 June 2001,great!,"Tom Hanks can carry a film by himself, as he more than proves in this masterpiece. Stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash, Hanks must make do on his own. Hanks gives a terrific performance as the survivor, and the movie could have gotten boring with just about anyone else. However, you will care what happens to Hanks in the film, and the film will keep you absorbed all the way. Hanks got a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his part, and if you haven't seen it, see it as soon as possible. You will love it.

13 November 2019,Still super good,"I hadn't seen this in years and had forgotten most of the details. Its a timeless movie just as good today as when it came out in 2000. I'd forgotten that this is ultimately a love story, had forgotten the despair, the giving up, the suicide attempt, mostly just remembered Wilson and Fire!

Tom Hanks is brilliant in his one man show of survival as airfreight executive Chuck Noland, a man who lives by the clock until his plane crashes and he washes ashore on a deserted island in the Pacific. For more than 4 years he struggles to stay alive sustained only by the companionship of a volley ball he names Wilson.

I still I had to question how easily Tom excepts that he is alone on a desert island, I lived in the Caribbean, some islands are very desolate in parts, he might have at least walked around the bay, there could have been a Hyatt Regency or a road or a cruise ship dock but no he just hunkers down on the beach. Liked the relationship with Helen Hunt, how hard it was for both of them. That scene with Wilson and the raft still made me cry. Best actor nomination to Tom Hanks.",9

27 July 2006,"Excellent survival theme; I am not a big Tom Hanks fan, but...","this film has a good message, and he is believable in this role. Also, something is to be said for the story, especially in this day and age, where everything is taken for granted.

Yes, many books and adventure stories have addressed similar themes (""Treasure Island"", ""Lord of the Flies"", etc.). And the theme of being stranded on an island is hardly unusual. However, the presentation is what counts, and this film is worth watching.

If you are ever experiencing something in your own life that seems insurmountable, and happen to catch this film, it may help suspend your disbelief, and actually make you feel better about life in general. After Hanks is stranded on a remote Pacific island, he realizes the frivolity of what used to be his life. He opens Fedex packages that contain a ballerina outfit, a greeting card and some other inane souveniers. He realizes the insanity of his predicament, and almost starts laughing.

Eventually he constructs shelter, and learns to spear fish; in his isolation he creates an imaginary friend, which is an alter-ego promoting his survival. These scenes were particularly well written. There is no sensationalism, no explosions, just a real person, trying to survive.

When he is finally rescued, his company (Fedex) throws a party for him- he sees the waste and futility of everyday life- lobster and King crab claws he lived on for a month are tossed in the trash.

He also loses his fiancé (Helen Hunt) to a dentist. I thought this was an unnecessary back-story.

Overall, you will be intrigued by this film, it is not your typical suspense/adventure film, and Hanks is very good. 9/10.",9
5 April 2019,one-man show,"As melancholy as it is affirming, ""Cast Away"" tells a darkly comic, occasionally punishing parable about what happens when humans lose sight of humility in life's grand scheme - an interesting thematic twin to Tom Hanks' own ""Joe vs. the Volcano.""

14 January 2004,Great story,"This is one of my favorite movies. There is such a good story for it and Tom Hanks does a great job in this film. Tom Hanks was nominated for best actor for this movie but lost it to Russell Crowe. Tom Hanks should have got it though. I really like how Tom Hanks grew all of the hair for his character himself instead of wearing a fake beard and wig. I especially like Wilson too, that was a good idea. I definetely give Cast Away 10 out of 10.

26 June 2001,The good side of mediocre,"In contrast to most people I found the quality even and unremarkable throughout. Would someone explain to me, for instance, what was so great about the plane crash? Yes, the moment when the cabin de-pressurises comes as a real jolt, but shock tactics are easy. It's like the moment in horror movies when a skeleton hand suddenly shoots up out of a grave. It's startling, not frightening. All in all the crash/storm sequence is humdrum and badly shot. What was the point of those intermittent blackouts? They're irritating; besides, Zemeckis has it backwards: a storm isn't light punctuated by darkness, it's darkness punctuated by light. If anything the plane crash was a low point.

That's the movie as a whole: decent but lacking, marred by poor craft throughout. Among the questionable decisions: computer generated whales (straight out of ""Fantasia 2000""), FedEx (they could so easily have used a made up brand name), and too much editing on the island. The last really destroyed our sense of the passage of time, and with it any idea we may have had of how well the Tom Hanks character was faring. How long did he go before finding enough water to live on? I don't know, but I suspect it's longer than Zemeckis tried to lead us to believe, with his frequent cuts. All the small sequences before the `four years later' caption (itself a cop-out), good though they may have been individually, collectively come across as mere montage rather than a sustained assault on the problem of survival.

-On the other hand, what was so bad about the third act? ""Cast Away"" is at heart a gently optimistic story of survival: its message is that mere survival - MERE survival - isn't really so bad as all that when you get to know it. Some people wanted Tom Hanks to feel utterly bleak, to fall to pieces, when confronted with civilisation again. Why would he? Living in a city again after four years would be like re-adopting a half-forgotten habit - riding a bicycle for the first time in a decade. The truth is, there's nothing much to say about what happens when he rejoins the larger world. I found the concluding section the most honest part of the film, if a little aimless.

All in all, not bad. I remember a reviewer writing that the Oscar Zemeckis won for ""Forrest Gump"" would destroy him as an artist. I remember thinking at the time: ""Well, how could it not? He's just been rewarded for creating something terrible."" And, it must be noted, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was Zemeckis's only masterpiece. But it was also an unrepeatable accident. The kind of zaniness it exemplifies so easily turns sour in his hands (as in ""Death Becomes Her"" or the entire Back to the Future trilogy); on the other hand, if he keeps plugging away in an attempt to create something grand, he may one day succeed.",7

25 September 2022,Cool Idea Poorly Executed and WAY Too Long,"I was sitting inside at a café with this on the TV dubbed (what little dialogue there is) into Spanish. I wasn't really paying attention, but I decided to watch it again. I can't remember what I thought of it the first time around which probably means I didn't think much of it. That about sums up my thoughts after rewatching it. There isn't a lot to like.

For one thing, at 2h23m it's simply too long. It would have been a lot better had the survival techniques been handled better. As it stands, this guy would have died of dehydration of starvation after a few weeks, if that. He was very slow on the uptake in the learning process. He never had a good source for water, his food supply was weak, and it took him forever to light a fire. He buried the pilot with most of his clothes on, clothes he desperately needed. A dead guy doesn't need his belt.

Speaking of fire, why didn't he make a fire at the top of the island?

I could have done without the whole Wilson pseudo-character, or definitely a lot less of it. Ditto that for him gazing lovingly at his girlfriend's image on the watch. He could have made something out of the ball and he could have burned the photo of his cheating girlfriend.

He builds the world's worse boat and sends himself out to sea with nothing in the way of supplies. Without sufficient water, he would have died in 3-4 days, tops. The chances of running into a ship would be little to none. And where did he have the package he delivered? Up his tuckus? It wasn't on the raft.

To top all of that off, he goes home and expects that his woman was waiting for him? That was less likely that his raft being spotted by a ship.",5
10 February 2001,A good movie,"This is really a good movie. How close to or how far are we from Stone Age? A man always worried with the pressure of time in this modern world finds himself after a plane crash and within minutes, living in Stone Age conditions in a paradise island that could be advertised by any tourist agency. And time doesn't count anymore now. What counts is survival everyday and the hope to be rescued one day but when?

25 December 2000,A stellar performance,"If Tom Hanks does not get an Oscar for his performance, I will be completely shocked. This film has so much going for it, the cinematography (breathtaking), the silent struggles of Hanks on the island, marking off the days in solitude, his efforts to survive and his deliberations about not wanting to, Tom Hanks conveys so much with expression and gesture and minimal dialogue. I was completely caught up. The only feeling of letdown was in the ending, it appeared as if the writer did not know where to take it. The 4 years away must have spiritually transformed and indelibly changed Tom Hanks, but there is no accommodation for this. This is unfortunate, as an otherwise stunning movie left me feeling ripped off. I gave it 8 out of 10 for the 90% that was incredible.

22 July 2011,Perhaps Tom Hanks' greatest film performance,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",9
24 January 2009,The final scene...spoiler,"spoiler alert? I really enjoyed this movie. It is amazing to think that Tom Hanks carried such a huge part of the film by himself. There wasn't even much music. during his time on the island, without much dialogue, he was amazing. Not too many actors could pull it off, I think.

In the last scene, after the girl drives off in the pickup with the dog in the back, Tom Hanks stands in the middle of the intersection staring, then the movie cuts away. What is he staring at, and what is he thinking. What did he decide to do? I can't quite figure out what he is thinking. Does he get an ""aha"" about what direction to take and why? Help!

12 August 2004,Great!,"Tom Hanks does a wonderful job in this film. His acting ability truly shines. What makes this film brilliant is the truthful reality that it presents. Even lighting the fire becomes very important... The story, direction and cinematography are all well done. My favorite part was keeping the secret in the package secret from him throughout the film. I certainly wish that he had taken the Oscar that year as well. Mr. Hanks will remain top actor for a very long time. He reminds very much of Jimmy Stewart. Great job everyone!

21 October 2015,Fantastic film about loss and survival,"Director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks reunite after working together in the 1994 Oscar-winning film Forrest Gump. Setting the two-time Oscar winning actor in a powerful story of survival and hope, this adventure delivers a story that embraces an intense and emotional character study of a stripped away from his comfortable life on civilization and casted out in a lonely world where only the strong-willed survive. The film stars Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a FedEX executive who goes on a business trip overseas. However, when his plane caught into a nasty storm and crashes, killing everyone on board except him, he finds himself stranded on a deserted island thousands of miles away from home and his girlfriend Kelly (played by Helen Hunt). With no one to contact for help, Chuck must test his physical, emotional, and mental skills to survive on a deserted island until someone comes and finds him. In the process, he finds a volleyball in an undelivered FedEX package. After cutting his hand, he gives the ball a face using his bloody hand print and befriends the ball as a companion, and names it 'Wilson'.

Robert Zemeckis blesses this film with an ingenious script and story telling, and Tom Hanks delivers an endearing performance as the main character. This film deals with a man with finds himself loss on a deserted island with absolutely no contact with any individuals, and must transform himself to a new person to survive a place where there is no ""real"" food, technology, or communication. How Tom Hanks' character develops is quite amazing and really moves the story along at a fairly effective pace. As the story progresses, his body becomes thin, his grows an excessive amount of facial hair to where he resembles a cave man, and his meals are reduced to crabs and fish he catches in the sea. He also begins having verbal conversations with a volleyball as a way coping with his loneliness. While there is little excitement to experience, the film always managing to keep the story alive and moving, and all this thanks to its captivating screenplay by William Broyles Jr. There are some emotional points towards the second half that have the potential of making sensitive viewers shed a few tears. Luckily these scenes are done in a manner that allow viewers to express emotions rather than manipulate them into sadness.

Cast Away is Robert Zemeckis's best film behind Forrest Gump and Back To The Future. It is a film that tells a brilliant story of survival, courage, and loss. How this film didn't receive any Oscar nominations other than Best Actor and Best Sound surprise a bit. Overall, this movie is nonetheless satisfying.",9
1 May 2004,great fed ex commercial,"i think this one is nothing more than a fedex commercial.

although, the premise is good, a modern guy, stranded on a deserted island, trying to fight for his life (with A LOT of help from fedex, of course), while at home he is babling about how great his company is....

i mean... c'mon... next time i want to see a movie powered by ups.

13 July 2001,The island scenes are great,"Tom Hanks is Type A FedEx exec stranded alone on South Pacific island after plane wreck; Hunt is the girl he leaves behind. I guess the off-island stuff was necessary, at least to some extent, but I didn't find it in the least engaging except for the very end. The bulk of the movie, with Hanks alone on the island, is lots of fun and beautifully filmed. Wilson goes down as one of the more unique movie characters.

20 May 2016,Tom Hanks and Wilson is an excellent double,"Cast Away is one of the best films of Zemeckis , the film has cast the fantastic Tom Hanks that virtually acts alone, the film's plot is simple , there is nothing more , the direction is good , and the Hanks performance is excellent, photography of the film is beautiful , the soundtrack is OK, the movie is over, and the pace is not as good , sometimes gets a little tired , his scenes the with Wilson ball are excellent , there shows the fantastic actor who is Tom Hanks, and deserved more until Russell Crowe (who was great in Gladiator ) , Cast Away is the third best movie of Zemeckis ( Forrest Gump and Back to the Future are better ) with a simple plot , great moments and a impeccable performance of Tom Hanks.

31 October 2022,Very entertaining Hollywoodish survival film,"I've seen this many times since it was released, but not in a long while. It's still a very good movie, but it was never a great one. It's main attribute is the lead performance, it's main ingredient as it's a one man show, from Tom Hanks and one has to give him some major applause for the physical transformation he went through for this role. To put it simply, it's an engrossing tale of a man stranded alone on an island for four years. Period. There's some background love story at the beginning and end of this film involving a sincere Helen Hunt, but that's more of a frame than a part of the big picture. It's a survival film with a rather exciting and thoroughly convincing early section of how he got to that island. There is some nice cinematography, but it's not in the league of another stranded on an island film, The Black Stallion.

Drinks dirty water in the cave!!! N leads healthy life!!! He keeps the fire for 2 long years without getting it extinguished!!! dunno where he gets sticks for that... might be doing some miracle!!! His wounds heal without giving him much trouble!!! just by winding his wound by a piece of cloth!!!

3 February 2001,Celebrate Humanity,"This film is brilliant. American movie-making at its' finest, deserving top honours.Following a plane crash and marooned on a desert island a survivor must learn to do just that---survive. The practicalities of how a human would cope with such a scenario seems to be realistically portrayed and the feel and sense of isolation and desolution is engendered superbly ...with depth, sensitivity and feeling. The real crux of this thought-provoking masterpiece is a truth about how the mystery of life's fortunes can affect an individual in the way events-and our attitude to them-unravel in determining our future.

I missed the first few minutes of the start of the film and when I entered the theatre I thought I was watching a commercial for Federal Express; though the use of a respected brand name product in the film is not only wholly justified but is central to the meaning and equalibrium of the movie. When a picture can bring tears to the eyes over the apparent loss of a volleyball(yes...a volleyball!) that shows genius in the production direction, writing and acting. I for one will look forward to watching this film again....and for its' celebration of humanity....it earns a perfect 10.",10

9 January 2001,Powerful Drama Courtesy Of Hanks And Zemeckis,"We live in a world in which the latest technology is taken for granted on a daily basis, and the `Fast Food Generation' is in charge; everything has to be done yesterday, and there's literally not enough hours in a day to do what `must' be done. In `Cast Away,' directed by Robert Zemeckis, a man who has bought into all of the above suddenly finds himself plucked from it-- seemingly at random-- and given something new to ponder: Life. Life, in it's most basic and primitive form; where all he has for survival are his two hands, his wits, and whatever nature, in all her glory, can provide. Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland, a supervisor for Fed-Ex who lives and dies by the clock; a world traveler whose time at home and with loved ones is calculated to the minute. On Christmas, he exchanges gifts with his intended, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), in the car before boarding yet another flight that will spirit him away to oversee the job in yet another city, another country. But this time, somewhere over the ocean, elemental forces take charge, his plane is forced to ditch in the sea, and Noland's life-- in a few seconds-- is changed forever. He survives, only to be washed ashore on a small, uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere, where he must confront Time-- and himself-- as never before. Though comparisons to `Robinson Crusoe' may spring to mind immediately, tuck them away in some back pocket of your memory, because what Zemeckis and Hanks give you here is anything but that. You learn enough about Noland and Kelly during the time leading up to the ill-fated flight, that by the time Noland lands on the island you know who this man is, what makes him tick, and also about the life and the love he leaves behind and what it will mean to them both. And knowing what you do, his time on the island becomes more than just a handbook for survival; it's an intimate portrait of a man coming to terms with himself and learning the hard way-- with the core of his existence, the clock, negated-- what it is that really matters in life. Among the invaluable lessons he learns is that, indeed, no man is an island; for he sorely lacks the one thing nature cannot provide: Companionship.

Hanks gives a tremendously subtle, yet powerful performance as Noland; if there is any doubt, consider the fact that he carries the film for more than an hour by himself without allowing the tension or the drama to lag. Zemeckis, of course, must be given credit for keeping it all on task, including what his star is doing, and together they make it riveting drama that keeps the viewer enthralled, not only by what is happening in the present, but by maintaining a sense of anticipation; that something is just around the corner, about to happen. The real strength of the film is in the way it's presented, and the way Hanks so successfully connects with the audience to create the empathy that allows the viewer to know what it would feel like to be in his place; understanding that sudden regard for all the things that are taken for granted every day: The simple creature comforts; a book of matches; water; having someone to share a laugh with. And most importantly, knowing that alternating sense of hope and despair Noland must live with without respite. A message so succinctly driven home and so well done that it leaves you with a real sense of awe. The metaphor of a man at the crossroads of his life has been done many times before, but never like this; with a nod to Zemeckis and Hanks, there is a purity to their treatment of the aforementioned theme with this film that is unparalleled. The supporting cast includes Nick Searcy (Stan), Lari White (Bettina) and Geoffrey Blake (Maynard Graham), all of whom add so much to the success of this film. But the performance that really ties it all together is given by the gifted Helen Hunt, who with a limited amount of screen time makes Kelly a heart-felt, memorable character. It's an exceptional performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. `Cast Away' is an engrossing film that-- make no mistake-- is about so much more than how a guy survives on a deserted island; it's about enlightenment, and taking stock of the things that matter before it's too late. A wake-up call, one could say, for a generation mired in technology, and governed by Time. I rate this one 9/10.",9
29 July 2005,"Quibbles with ""Cast Away""","I was quite impressed with many aspects of this film, but I have to point to a couple of quibbles which helped keep it from being the fully realized work of art it could have been:

1)The first 15 minutes of the film contain as many product placements as I can remember seeing in that short of a time. This is a MAJOR negative to me, as it destroys the suspension of disbelief and immersion in a cinematic world which is so important to the enjoyment of narrative film. The profusion of FedEx logos was comical at times, as in the Moscow airport scene. The film would have been far more effective, in my view, if Hanks has worked for a fictional delivery firm rather than the real-life FedEx. My teenage son argues that use of brand names makes the film more ""realistic."" I firmly disagree. The use of brands and logos is a constant reminder that you are watching a commercial enterprise backed by labyrinthine financial deals. I thought this was a major problem with ""ET"" as well. (I would give them a pass on the ball called ""Wilson"" - that was a pretty good joke, but overall far too many product references.)

2) The filmmakers make the same mistake that Defoe made in ""Robinson Crusoe"" - the ending is too long and anticlimactic. If you've read ""Crusoe"" in its original text, you may remember the superfluous episode of a race over the mountains to Lisbon after Crusoe's return. In ""Cast Away"", judicious editing could have shortened the denouement by at least 10 minutes and still made all of its points. The result would have been a better film.",7
10 August 2001,Does Hank's pull this off?,"Before i saw this film i had my own pre concieved ideas of what it would be like. I knew this film was about a guy who get stuck on a deserted island and i wondered how and if they could make this interesting.If anybody could make a film like this work it would be Tom Hanks. Lets face it how many bad film has he made?

Does hanks pull it off? I'm not too sure if he does. The film is good but because of the concept of the film it is hard for it not to be a little boring and it is at times. Credit should go to Hank's because he does a De Niro stile Weight Loss to make his stay on the island look realistic but i dont think it is enough. Don't get me wrong Cast Away is not a bad film it just not that exciting.

8 October 2002,It's all about survival.,"After watching this film several times,first at the theater,then at home,I've reached the conclusion that it's about survival.Not just about Chuck Noland's survival,but the survival of the most important person in his life,Kelly.He lost civilization as he knew it,and had to use his resources to survive.Kelly,although very little is shown from her point of view,lost the most important person in her life.Both suffered losses, and though it was hard,they did what they could to survive and get on with their lives.I have no doubt that many see this film as being just about Chuck and his survival on a deserted island for four years,but if they look at it more deeply,they will see much,much more.Great acting and chemistry by Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.A must see!

1 January 2001,Time and tide wait for no man,"The title may be a pun telling us that we must cast away all the junk we call civilization. Hanks gives his trademark low-key everyman performance in this post-modern Robinson Crusoe tale which shows that choices lead to consequences and even when we think we are at a dead end, we are only at a crossroads.

This is an intriguing story with no formula conclusion, and it is Hanks that holds the whole saga together.

23 July 2001,Huh? What a waste.,"One word sums up this movie. Huh? They made us sit through hours of watching this pathetic character bumbling around on this island. Why? So he could deliver a FED-EX package?!? And it wasn't even delivered! He returned it to the sender! This movie is a two hour Fed-Ex commercial. Not worth the rent. The main character was stupid and boring, not worth watching. There was no resolution at the end, not even one of those ""Leaves you wondering"" endings. Just stupid.

This movie left me so angry, that I will never use FED-EX again. Oh, and I'll never buy a Wilson ball again either.

11 May 2021,Oscar worthy performance by Tom hanks,"Before I even get into that film Tom hanks was extraordinary in this. He's amazing in literally every film I've seen. He's definitely one of the top top actors of today. The film itself was great, it slightly annoyed me when he wouldn't open the fedex boxes because that would've been the first thing I would've done. I like to think I would've lasted quite a while on that island but he definitely did things that I would've never thought of. If I ever get stranded I'll be stealing some of those ideas. The only bad thing about the film is when he got of the island it went so slow it was unreal but other then that, I know now why people call this film an all time classic. Great film, great acting, I enjoyed it a lot.

18 December 2021,One of the best simple movies,"Why simple? Because there's barely any dialogue, you're just on a silent ride of exploration and survival with the main protagonist. And that's actually really immersive, as well as simple in a good way.

Why one of the best? Because rewatching it after a few years - it's still as engaging and entertaining as the first time.

I can't say it features amazing acting or my favorite actors, but almost everything about this movie is iconic and holds up 22 years later. A must watch.

Plus it's pretty realistic that we have a man who suffers for 4 years hoping to get back to his loving wife, only to find out that she ""buried"" him and remarried immediately, forgetting about him, yet he keeps crawling back... Typical Tom Hanks movie in that aspect, kinda like Forrest Gump. But that sad cringe aside, good movie.",7

23 December 2000,Tom Hanks saves it!,"To Hanks saves this movie from failing.This movie was created for a great movie actor and Tom Hanks did a very good job.No real suprises in this movie and we got exactly what it promised.The movie reminds us that anything can happen in life and our journey can take very unexpected turns anytime.It would do us a whole lot of good to keep this in mind so we may be better prepared mentally when such events happen to us.We must never expect our life journey to be predictable.We can only do our very best to achieve our goals but at the same time be constantly aware how easily events could cause very divergent paths to anywhere.The weak points are it's predictability and condescending start(Lenin's picture being taken down in Moscow for example)but it's weak points were not enough to ruin this movie.A near classic.Another touchdown for Hanks!

18 February 2009,"Uneven film, good Hanks, generally engrossing","'Castaway' has a slow start and the film initially tends to drag until a terrifying plane crash which is very well depicted. The long mid-section with (MINOR SPOILERS) Tom Hanks all alone on a deserted island is well worth watching. Hanks is a good actor and watching him trying to survive is an engrossing experience. Unfortunately, there are some mawkish scenes involving a basketball named Wilson, which should have been more subtle. There is some annoying product placement as well. The last act is interesting to watch. Helen Hunt has a supporting role and is alright.

Overall 7/10

20 December 2002,Excellent movie!,"Tom Hanks makes another blockbuster...how do he do dat? Pretty much anything that Hanks touches is a huge hit! Sure, he's a great actor, but that can't explain his phenomenal success. Anyway, this is yet another great film starring Tom Hanks. He's by far the major player in this film, considering that he's alone on an island for much of the film. He's cast perfectly and he delivers perfectly. The story has been reviewed dozens of times, I'm certain, so I'll not go into that. The film is a commentary on the resiliency of man. And casting Hanks was a very smart move!

9 August 2021,Modern Robinson Crusoe-minus Friday!,"Probably NOT a good idea to watch this, whether freeview or other after having a bad day. Tom Hanks IS 90% of this film, plus a basketball called ""Wilson"". For me, waste of a couple of hours, nothing really exciting here. Plane crash..one survivor....several years alone on an island...returns to civilisation....loses long term girlfriend to someone else....end.... Not really much in this!

11 February 2001,Dramatic moments beyond my wildest expectations,"Most of us, I think, knew the general outline of the plot before reaching the theatre. However, the plane crash early in the film was drama beyond my wildest expectations. This incident from the initial warnings to the actual plunge into the Pacific was one of my most horrifying cinematic experiences. I literally went down with that plane. The ""Robinson Crusoe""-like scenes which followed were interesting to a point although I thought Chuck (Tom Hanks) was rather slow in discovering a method of catching water from the torrential rains. While it was necessary for the scriptwriter to introduce dialogue, I found some of the conversations between Chuck and the face on the ball rather silly and even a bit embarrassing, but I came to accept them in the knowledge that Chuck was on the point of madness anyway after years of isolation. A great piece of cinema followed when the ocean liner sped past an almost dying man face down on his broken raft. I was so anxious... Would the officers on the bridge see him or not? The final homecoming was so touching, so moving and with such unexpected consequences. Yes.. this is the story of a man who through 4 years of loneliness holds a dream close to his heart. Fate plays strange tricks and when the outcome is analysed no-one is really to blame.",8
11 May 2005,Little lacking criticism of modern life,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",7

15 February 2014,Much better than I originally thought.,"I never really enjoyed this movie when it first came out but after watching it again over 10 years later I have found a new appreciation for it. I think initially I was too young to appreciate a film that consists of one man and a desert island for an entire 2 hrs. After I overcame this initial view I discovered that Cast Away is actually a really good movie. Tom Hanks truly is one of the best actors out there. He has the ability to catch your attention and keep you entertained with limited assistance.

There still are the major cringe factors in the movie and also the scenes of heartbreak. And I never will love the ending but it really is a great movie that was very well done.

18 June 2001,Lack of the Survival aspect.,"While Cast Away is an entertaining film the love story portion between the Tom Hanks character and Helen Hunts character seemed (getting down to brass tacks) to do very little for the over all story. The ending, which was also pointless, went on way too long and likewise served no purpose. The film shows that Hanks Chuck Noland survives for four years on the island but offers only glimpses as to how he does it. Instead of a tale of survival the viewer is given the old standard two people in love separated by an act of fate with one eventually giving up and finding someone else then the other returns looking for their old flame. This picture does not rank up there as a great movie about survival but it seems it could have had that been the emphasis.

17 July 2001,Mediocre story propped up by outstanding Hanks performance,"The last time Tom Hanks teamed up with director Robert Zemeckis the result was `Forrest Gump'. I can safely say this is no `Forrest Gump'. FG was a terrific story, further enhanced by outstanding acting. This is a decent story propped up by phenomenal acting.

The initial premise was intriguing. A Fedex employee is stranded on a deserted island and is forced to use his ingenuity to survive. At first, it is fascinating watching Chuck (Tom Hanks) adapt to his stark environment. However, after about an hour of screen time devoted solely to his island exploits, the film begged for a cut to somewhere else. There were numerous themes that were running simultaneous to his island struggles. There was the search and rescue, and Kelly's (Helen Hunt) coming to terms with his loss to mention the two most obvious themes that were completely neglected.

Instead, Zemeckis decided that we should have all Tom all the time, which despite his gargantuan talent and over the top performance, became just a bit more Tom than I could stand. Zemeckis did a superb job with the photography and induced one of Hanks best performances. Unfortunately, the film became one-dimensional and began to bog down. The ending brought no relief from the drudgery, leaving viewers adrift without the emotional release necessary to bring the story to closure.

Tom Hanks was in top form. He deservedly was nominated for yet another best actor award by the Academy (his fifth). It seems everywhere I turn lately I see Helen Hunt. She made four films in 2000 and I have seen them all in the last two months. This was one of her better performances of the year, though the part was small.

The film grossed over $200 million, which shows that for most people just being able to see Tom Hanks is enough. I rated it 7/10. The one-dimensional story and flat ending stifled my enthusiasm despite a tour de force performance by Hanks.",7
18 December 2020,Robinso Crusoe with Tom Hanks,"An excellent film with an excellent Tom Hanks. Most of the film is played by him alone, so it is all the more amazing how he plays the role with a lot of energy and conviction. The story is told so emotionally that you almost cry in the end. Even after 20 years this film has lost none of its charm. Director Robert Zemeckis had already been able to rely on his actor Tom Hanks for his film Forrest Gump. As in this film, a perfect double.

11 February 2001,Brilliant Movie with one of the best actors around.,"Before watching this movie i expected it to be good. I mean the trailer is great, the story-line is different not to mention brilliant, it's directed by a fantastic director and stars one of the best actors around. As soon as the film started i knew it was going to live up to my expectations. It was FANTASTIC. The performances by everyone was great and the special effects were amazing. Wilson the volleyball put in a very nice performance to and Tom Hanks what can i say BRILLIANT as usual. The man is one of the best actors EVER. Cast Away has everything you could want so go see it now. The best movie i have seen this year, not to mention one of the best movies i have ever seen. Go see it NOW. 10/10!

24 September 2016,Good but left hungry at the end,"This is one of those films that seems to set up everything in the story for a massive emotional landing, with a lead actor like Tom Hanks, the same director as Forest Gump's, and this incredible journey the protagonist goes through... one could feel that something great is in the brewing process. But not really. Not at all, in fact. The very beginning is pretty boring up until the crash scene which is amazing, and much more intense if not brutal than one would expect of such a mainstream production while not being overdone either. Just a great cinematic moment on all accounts.

Then, it was very ambitious to make a film with such a main idea. The film goes on 2hrs25min, and the bulk of it does take place on that island. And yet it never gets boring and as an audience we're spontaneously mandated to participate in the adventure as being people ourselves we immediately relate to the great difficulty of surviving both physically, and mentally in such dire conditions. The film does a good job staying fresh from scene to scene, and not bordering on the purely depressing realm this easily could've dwelt in.

The problem is a highly forgettable final act, it's made clear at the end that there isn't any of that earlier high promise that will be fulfilled and a very ordinary and flat-out weak, if not also ambiguous and unclear in itself conclusion to a story that seemed to possess immense potential on an emotional and human level. Some elements that seemed important get a very plain and often disappointing resolution in the ending narrative, and one really would've wished for a much stronger depiction of the protagonist's relationship with his dearest love of his life, something of a deeper kind with parallels back and forth between his current, hindering life and the one he longs to get back.",7

8 May 2002,Jon Monsarrat review: Fascinating & accessible drama; not too arty,"I came into ""Cast Away"" with a couple of strikes against me. Although I have a lot of respect for Tom Hanks, I hated the melodrama and sappiness in ""Forrest Gump"". And I'm not usually into dramas, because they're too deep for me. But since I'm an action movie guy, I figured there would be some action in the film.

There sort-of is. But the film is primarily a drama / thriller, with plenty of suspense about our hero's survival chances. Tom Hanks makes the movie. I can't say it plainer than that. The acting is so gripping, so compelling -- and keep in mind on a desert island he's mainly playing off inanimate objects -- that even though I'm not an arty type I just had to watch fascinated, similar to how in a good action flick I'm fascinated at how the stunt people put together the stunts.

The only negative comment I might make is that the end of the film was slow-paced and not entirely satisfying to me.

Who should see this film:

-- Everyone, even if you hate dramas

I'll give ""Cast Away"" a near-miss perfect 9 out of 10.",9

28 April 2004,Great movie with an entriguing story full of courage and hope,"I was really impressed in what this film was going to come out to be. I was suprised how good it was. I thought it was just going to be one of those other Robinson Crusoe movies but this was different and I loved how the story was. Some of it was slow and boring at one scene but that's just some of it. Most of it was really entertaing and I loved the landscaping of the film with the deserted island and the ocean. It also had humor too like when Tom Hanks was talking to the volleyball Wilson. I also liked how Tom Hanks ate his fish for survival and making his little boat. This was an interesting film and I would like everyone to see this movie.

5 January 2004,What happened after his rescue?,"Overall, Cast Away was a really good movie. But there's a big hole right in the middle of it. Hanks is finally rescued and in the next scene he's all cleaned up and on a corporate jet heading home.

What happened between the rescue and the flight home? Give us 10 or 15 minutes showing Hanks readjusting back to civilization - catching up on the headlines, marvelling at new technology, seeing his family for the first time, sitting down with a therapist, something!

23 December 2007,"A lesson for all of us, who do not enjoy life today as it happens","A movie of depth at many human levels, Cast Away was a unique film among the many of the great films of the 20th Century. And what a great film and story to start the 21st Century, this new Century that is certain to hold rapid change for the human endurance, as was the last. The main character, Chuck Noland lives in the fast lane, his life but a blur, representing a person who is but a cast away from family and life, a runner in a global world of change and commerce, with little time to ponder the important things in life, putting all the important things aside. But as fate would have it, Chuck Noland is cast away into another world, one of loneliness, and stripped to the bare essentials of life, in a quest for survival on a remote island, he is now a cast away from the civilization. Apart from the life he took for granted, and his love, he is stripped to the bare essentials, with only the slim hope that he might one day see his fiancé again, and not take everything for granted as he did before. With little chance of rescue, he carries the human quality of hope. Hope for rescue, and hope to see his fiancé and family once again, and this hope is granted through a sail, which starts him back towards a return to civilization.

But his human struggle was not over. Upon Chuck Noland's return he must again cast himself away from the love he once knew, and cast away a love he once knew, that carried him through all those years of loneliness. Once again, in the middle of all of modern civilization, Chuck Noland is again a cast away from the life he knew, and is alone again. But as fate would have it, he would find himself again with hope, as he struggles to return to the meaning of life. and like the winds that helped rescue him from that desolate island, he again finds hope in the emblem, an image of angels wings that had sustained his existence for a very long time. And in this moment, among the empty expanse of land, not ocean, he once again casts away his past, and must begin a new life, where time is not a master, having learned to enjoy life as it comes. It is this meaning that all humans must learn, or suffer being a cast away in the sea of humanity, in a world of sea of change.

A story perhaps, but maybe there is something more meaningful for all of us...and a lesson we could all learn easily.",9

15 March 2020,Better Than Expected,"For a film that spends a fair amount of its runtime with a single character trapped on an island with nobody but a volleyball to talk to, this movie was surprisingly entertaining. It takes someone with the acting capabilities of Tom Hanks to be able to portray something like that and do a good job of it. This movie, surprisingly, has a lot of story besides the stranded-scene stuff. It's wildly entertaining from start to finish but it also manages to have a lot of heart. Overall, it's a very well-done film.

28 December 2000,"Long, depressing, dreadful commercial.","This thing is way too depressing for a holiday movie, and the most shameless ""product positioning"" movie I've ever seen. It was more a two-hour commercial for the carrier (and, incidentally, for the ball manufacturer - how many times did he shout ""Wilson"" at the waves???) than an entertaining movie. And the ending - a crossroads experience?? An eyebrow raising leer, for heaven's sakes? Gaack!

I must give credit to the makeup artists and Hanks for the ageing and weathering process - well done indeed. Hunt's cameo appearance (it really can't be called much more than that, surely) was wooden at best - absolutely no rapport with Hanks; and his performance was only mediocre.

A movie suited best for late night TV - they wouldn't even have to interrupt it for commercials, since that's about all there is to watch.

Half the film is all Hanks alone, talking to a volleyball... and yet it never gets boring. That certainly is a testament to his performance.

26 December 2000,Strong adventure saga,"""Cast Away"" reteams the star and director of ""Forrest Gump"" (Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis), and the final result: a terrific adventure film that's just a few notches down from ""Gump"". Hanks plays a FedEx employee who hitches a ride on a FedEx plane that's flying over the Pacific Ocean until disaster strikes. Flying through a severe storm, the plane suffers major damage and crashes in the ocean. The Hanks character survives the crash, and washes up on a deserted island. It is here where he does everything he can to stay alive, and it's not an easy task. ""Cast Away"" was shot in two parts. When they finished filming the first part, they stopped making the movie for a while so Hanks could lose 40-50 pounds to make it look like his character had been stranded on the island for years. This will guarantee Hanks his fifth career Oscar nomination for sure. He's brilliant in ""Cast Away"". It took alot of guts to lose all that weight. The other familiar face in the cast is Helen Hunt, who has a nice small supporting role as Hanks' girlfriend. In between the two parts of making ""Cast Away"", director Zemeckis went off and made this summer's hit film ""What Lies Beneath"". ""Cast Away"" is much better than that film. It brings Zemeckis back to full form (in addition to ""Forrest Gump"", some of Zemeckis' other great films include a trio from the '80s: ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Back to the Future"", and my personal favorite, ""Romancing the Stone""). ""Cast Away"" has just a few boring spots, but it moves at a brisk pace. It's an exciting adventure. Plus there are a few funny spots (the scenes where Hanks talks to the volleyball made me laugh a couple of times). A very good movie.

21 January 2001,Good film,"Cast Away is a very impressing film when Chuck is stranded on the desert island. There are no cop outs here: no crying fiancé in the US, no melodramatic music, no dangers apart from loneliness. Quite brilliant. However, in ""the real world"" the movie lacks pace and suspense and Helen Hunt offers another mediocre performance. Cast Away is a good film, even brilliant at times, but it does not deliver all the time. (6/10)

25 December 2000,nearly hits the mark,"For a film that features basically one actor for an hour and a half, this delivers pretty well. Hanks is some sort of air courier whose plane crashes in the middle of the ocean. He manages to find an island and do the old ""live off the land"" thing for awhile. One of two things I didn't go for was the length of time he supposedly spends marooned. Others have spoiled it but I will leave it to you in finding out, it just seemed too unreal. I feel he would've lost his mind after just a few months if he didn't die from the elements first. Hanks really manages to hold the film together pretty well, as they interject a good amount of comic moments. The filming style is a bit odd, as Bob Z. uses a sort of documentary style, using no music and shooting Hanks work activities mostly in close-up. It's all well photographed, especially a very dramatic plane crash. But that other thing I didn't like about the film makes a real difference: the totally dissatisfying ending. After about 90 minutes on the island, the screenplay only dedicates about 15 minutes to Hanks homecoming (yes, that could be considered spoiling, but you probably saw it in the previews anyway). Not enough of his return to society was explored, and things close out with a dull stare into the camera that doesn't resolve anything. Also look out for shameless plugs for ""Federal Express"" and Wilson volleyballs, which Hanks actually befriends(!). That could've done with a little trimming as well, his wacked out love for the ball. I know he's lonely and needed a ""companion"", but they should've said enough already with the tears after he loses his buddy. But I would suggest you go for the survival element, which totally shocked me with its pace. I usually check my watch a few times during a film but was amazed to see it was the 2 hour mark when I first did it with this movie. Zemeckis directed the most excellently paced movie ever (in my opinion), ""Back to the Future"", and he doesn't fail here, keeping things going with engrossing vignettes of what Hanks goes thru.

10 March 2001,Not disappointing,"I hope everybody understands that the strong point of such films is not the plot but the scenery, the audiovisual effects and (less) the acting. Given this, Cast Away is a decent production, which rewards the audience asking for suspense and agony. As Gladiator, it is meant to be seen at DTS/THX theaters. Unfortunately, after the (predictable) rescue, you will feel an inevitable urge to sleep.

6 July 2001,"Cast Away, directed by Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath, Forrest Gump), takes the viewer alongside its protagonist to witness a dramatic physical, psychological and emotional transformation","A FedEx systems engineer, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) has efficiently built his life around the clock. Driven by his commitment toward punctuality, Chuck succeeds in maintaining his company's reputability, often putting on hold his love life with Kelly (Helen Hunt: Pay It Forward). Chuck's priority is reaffirmed when he decidedly interrupts a Christmas Eve dinner, as he is unexpectedly summoned to attend to an important business duty overseas. Chuck's life takes a dramatic turn that night, when his airplane crashes into the sea. Managing to surface from the sea unharmed, Chuck reaches an isolated island. Alone and away from civilization, Chuck is forced to test his adaptability skills, find the drive to survive, and rediscover the timeless qualities of life.

Cast Away relies on location --the extreme nature of its settings, such as the hostile sea and an isolated island-- to create a story that focuses on the mental and physical processes of its protagonist as he confronts physical isolation. Due to the simplicity of its premise (a man who is stranded in an island must learn to adapt in order to survive), Cast Away finds its meaning in the mechanics of its character's adaptability. Specifically, Cast Away focuses on the step-by-step survival, which mostly involves securing food, seeking shelter and making a fire. The camera seldom pulls away to objectify a scene, follows its subject's evolution closely, and resists cutting to scenes outside of the protagonist's new world. (Once the character has reached the island, the only images reminding the viewer of civilization are the objects inside a few FedEx packages that float onto the shore.) In this manner, Cast Away establishes an intimate relationship between its protagonist and the viewer. Cast Away uses an extended ellipsis of time to dramatize the character's transformation, demonstrating that by taming Nature he has learned to satisfy his needs, and that by obeying his imagination he has managed to protect his sanity. In this sense, Cast Away offers an intriguing commentary on modern man's ability to return to his primitive origins. The film's realism is enhanced by the use of natural sounds, which are only replaced by external music one hour and a half into the film.

Aside from these strengths, Cast Away suffers from mawkish sentimentality in those scenes that attempt to moralize its character. In one scene, Chuck finds a card inside a FedEx package, which reads: ""The most beautiful thing in the world is the world itself."" In a later scene, when Chuck realizes he must calculate the rhythm of the rise and fall of the tide in order to safely sail away, he is reminded of his company's motto: ""Let's not commit the sin of turning our back on Time."" These advisory proclamations disrupt the more effectively established non-communication between two detached worlds. In spite of this, the film's additional exploration (toward the end) of society's readiness to cast away its absent member, adds poignancy to the overall drama. Due to Hanks' accurate performance and his physique's notable transformation, Cast Away may be seen as a film that carefully constructs its story around character: its most exploited asset.",9
16 September 2022,"Cast Away is a brilliant movie in many ways, but some disappointing story and character decisions keep it from being a personal favorite.","Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",5
13 January 2001,One of the best films of the year.,"Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis take you on a journey that you'll not soon forget. When we first meet Hanks' character, he's a time obsessed FedEx employee who lives by the clock. His entire life has to be scheduled at least a week in advance. Then, one fateful evening he departs on a plane that crashes into the Pacific. After surviving the crash, Chuck is washed ashore on an island in the middle of nowhere. Now, he has nothing but time on his hands. Slowly but surely, Chuck begins to reawaken primal insticnts that have layed dormant in him, and through this, we see just how resourseful, and resiliant humans can be. To their credit, Zemeckis and Hanks never resort to anything that would be found on Gilligan's Island. No pirates, no apes, no nothing in fact. All that is on island is Hanks, and whatever has washed ashore. Since humans are a social animal, the need for communication is essential, and one of the best relationships developed in the film is between Chuck and Wilson. Through Wilson, Chuck is able to express his concerns, his fears, his hopes and this allows him a shred of sanity.

Once again, Robert Zemeckis shows hi s mastery at the art of storytelling. He makes good use of the visual effects to propel the story forward, and the effects never take center stage. Even during the very realistic plane crash. The effects are there to help the story, they are not the story. Tom Hanks shows that he's one of the best actors working today. His weight loss for the film has been duly noted in many papers and periodicals but to see him go from a thick, bear like man to a skeletal frame with a scraggly beard is quite shock. He gives his all for his performance, and there are scenes on and off the island that contain only Hanks, and these scenes are heartbreaking.

Some may complain that the running time is too long, that the film starts to slow down once Hanks is on the island. Well, that's the point. We begin to feel what he's going through. With nothing but time on your hands, and no way to measure it, time seems to stand still.

Cast Away is one of the better films this season, and one of the best films of the year. Thanks in part to the performance of Tom Hanks and the masterful direction of Robert Zemeckis.",
28 August 2004,The first shot is the best,"You only truly get one shot at experiencing this movie. The first viewing is important. It is a very satisfying and intriguing plot that develops slowly and steadily. You may think this has all been done before, but stand corrected here and now: what a difference Tom Hanks makes.

This is an emotional rollercoaster ride through a series of events, and just when you think you can't cry anymore, along comes Helen Hunt to further reduce you to tears of love lost through no fault other than time. Absence not only makes the heart grow fonder, but it makes the heart lament the lost time that can never be recovered nor the bridges broken be repaired.

The movie has my respect, because I fell in love with an inanimate object; Wilson. I am not ashamed to admit I cried over Wilson! I dare anyone to say they didn't feel a tug over that one! You are lying! Wilson was an involuntary symbol--I won't embellish further, but a symbol none the less.

Tom Hanks reportedly lost quite a bit of weight during the filming of this movie--the whole things was put on hiatus for a long time period to facilitate this feat. Amazing! He shines bright in this one, but in my book, Hanks is always shining.",

19 June 2015,A gripping survival drama and an Excellent Movie!!!!,"An exploration of human survival and the ability of fate to alter even the tidiest of lives with one major event, Cast Away tells the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a Federal Express engineer who devotes most of his life to his troubleshooting job. His girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) is often neglected by his dedication to work, and his compulsive personality suggests a conflicted man. But on Christmas Eve, Chuck proposes marriage to Kelly right before embarking on a large assignment. On the assignment, a plane crash strands Chuck on a remote island, and his fast-paced life is slowed to a crawl, as he is miles removed from any human contact. Finding solace only in a volleyball that he befriends, Chuck must now learn to endure the emotional and physical stress of his new life, unsure of when he may return to the civilization he knew before.

Find out to watch this fabulous drama on survival and never say die attitude.

26 December 2000,Triumph of the human spirit...howzat?,"CAST AWAY has gotten much praise as a sort of existential

blockbuster: Tom Hanks, a stick, a volleyball and a crab for a

whole hour! J. Hoberman has memorably described as the

""bleakest vision of human existence in studio filmmaking since

Douglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE.""

Beg to differ. The key that winds this baby up is the theme that

unites most high-period Tom Hanks movies: the American can-do

spirit. Like the guy using a sock and a ballpoint pen to fix a

spaceship in APOLLO THIRTEEN, like the guy firing a pistol feebly

at a Panzer tank in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Hanks' Chuck Noland,

FedEx work and late-twentieth-century guy extraordinaire, doesn't

so much look into the abyss as kick its butt using technology and a

little bit of Yankee elbow grease. Hanks, a fan of 2001, seems to

have completely mislearned its lessons: no major commercial

film artist, not even James Cameron, seems so enraptured by the

transcendent power of technos.

The director, Robert Zemeckis, lays it on thick at the beginning:

Chuck is a time-is-money type-A geek who sits with his fiancee

(Helen Hunt) and plots out quality time with her as they both peer

into identical datebooks. (Had the movie not been inexplicably set

in 1995, they could zap their Palm Pilots at each other.) Then,

marooned on a desert island...well, you'd think he'd learn

something about stopping to smell the roses. Or his laid-on-thick

emotional blockedness. Or something, other than how to rub two

sticks together. But, as if they studied Bresson and David Mamet,

Hanks and Zemeckis have no time for sticky feelings. It's

procedure, the how-to, that excites them. And though it must have

seemed terribly daring to spend so much time with one guy

onscreen, a static camera, and no music or dialogue, this stuff is

by far the most engaging in the movie.

The movie gets inspirational in its last movements, a tribute to

never giving up, or not letting go of your dream, or love-will-show-the-way, or some other development-world cliche.

The last moments of the movie are staggering in their inadequacy.

The filmmakers seem to have eschewed every possible cornball

ending, every chance for cheap uplift...and then they replace it with

nothing at all. The movie doesn't so much end as stop, as if the

screenwriter, puzzled and disgusted, threw his typewriter across

the room.

The level of drama isn't helped much by the casting of Helen Hunt

as Chuck's beloved. Is there a more unsympathetic major female

star in movies today? Hunt right now has the number one and two

movies in America. What are people seeing that I'm missing? And

does Hanks realize how much of this performance, which some

are touting as among the greatest of all time, is a carbon copy of

his work in a little number called JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO?",
11 July 2001,Tom Hanks the Island Man,"Tom Hanks reunites with FORREST GUMP-director Robert Zemekis for this stunning drama about how a regular Joe Fed Ex employee named Chuck

becomes a rough-necked survivor on a desert island after a fatal

plane crash over the South Pacific.

Hanks plays his character with understandable anguish, and he does a damn good job of it, too. Helen Hunt plays his love, who anticipated Chuck's return a little too much.

9 October 2001,Good movie. Full of Jungian archetypal images and symbols,"I saw the movie Cast Away and enjoyed it, not only for the fine acting by Tom Hanks (who doesn't need my praise) but for the thorough integration of Jungian psychological symbols throughout the movie.

The image of the island is an age-old symbol of alienation where the ego is `cast away' (note that the name of the movie separates the two words usually conjoined when referring to a person, but separated when referring to a physical state or in this case, a psychological state) and meant to engage in a task of self-discovery. Hanks does so throughout the rest of the movie. We see the character played by Hanks at the beginning of the movie, a slave to the clock - an executive of a company - a cog in a system. Who cares if it is Fed Ex as some of the other commentators have mentioned. So what? Would they feel better about the movie if the air courier service was named `No-Name Airlines'?

After the plane crashes he makes his way to the island where shortly afterwards he undertakes a symbolic burial of his old self or ego when he finds and buries the crew-member of the airplane. Then he descends into the island cave - an image of his unconscious where he encounters himself. Four years on the island. To any Jungian this is a quaternity symbol. Other Jungian images are apparent: the faint light he sees in the distance to which he tries to swim after on the island a short time - his goal that he is not ready to assume: the waves (his unconscious) push him back. Wilson, the basketball, a symbol of his self with whom he converses by why of psychological projection. The primitive paintings on the wall of the cave in which Hanks sleeps - reminiscent of the ancient wall paintings in France and Spain - all archetypal images of the collective unconscious. The whale which looks at Hanks after his release from the island - a symbol of the dynamic unconscious with which he has reconciled or rather integrated. Finally, the eagle wing symbol on the Fed Ex package - the symbol of the archetypal Self in Jung's psychology, the very place he seeks at the end of the movie and which he finally realizes at the very end while standing at the cross-roads. He has arrived at himself and integrated his life, no matter what direction he goes in, it doesn't matter.

There are many other Jungian symbols in this very good movie. Some are very explicit while others are subtle. Think I'm over psychologizing this movie? Ask Semekis the director. I bet he has either undergone Jungian analysis or read an awful lot of Carl Jung himself. Those are my thoughts.",
25 March 2006,Touching island survival tale with a disappointing ending,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

3 March 2023,Definitely worth a couple viewings.,"I'll be honest, the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too sure if I liked it. I mean, I certainly enjoyed it, but I just wasn't too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole. I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around. And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan, so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first. But, all in all, I've watched the film enough times now that I can say ""I love this film!!!""

When I really stop and think about it, the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, ""Forrest Gump""). The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor. Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual. You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island. Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work. As much as I liked Russell Crow in ""Gladiator"", I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar). Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance. There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.

This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch. There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island. So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook. So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it.",10

4 September 2002,What's in the FedEx package he DIDN'T open ?,"9/10 ""A Must see""

Very nice movie. Maybe not original as a story (guy on a deserted island trying to get home). I hope Hanks knew when reading the script that there wasn't a girl, not even a granny - unless you consider Wilson a girl), but Tom Hanks plays it very realistic and, as a movie, i have not seen anything like it. The movie has only one shortcoming; in the end he returns one unopened FedEx package... but what the hell was in it ?

Tom, a manager of a Fed Ex distributor, ( there's a lot of product placements in this movie) lives and breaths the company. When on a overly long plane journey one Christmas much to the annoyance of his ever suffering friends and girlfriend. His plane goes down, being the only survivor on a desert island in the Pacific Ocean. Hanks desperate for food supplies starts to ransack the surviving fed ex parcels much to his annoyance and in a frantic search for his meat and two veg cuts his hand, during this search he finds a Wilson basket ball, which he discards due to its lack of taste. Unfortunately he smears blood over the ball. Overtime the bloody pattern begins to look like a face, Hanks starts to talk to the ball and calls it Wilson ( product placement again)

Well I won't go into too much detail needless to say the Fed Ex man is true to his word and delivers the goods.

A man working for UPS, I believe, plane crashes and is castaway on a deserted island. He has to work the way that you see in books and on other movies in order to have his survivor skills. The movie is intelligent and unlike most movies like this, is not killed by flaws. WHOEVER HAS NOT SEEN THIS, DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER. IT RUINS EVERYTHING!

23 March 2004,A Very Powerful Movie!,"Cast Away

Starring: Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt

Genre: Drama

Rated: PG-13

This is the most very powerful Tom Hanks movie ever and also one of my favorite Tom Hanks movies! The movie is about a FedEx guy named Chuck Noland (Hanks) who is in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) and they were almost getting to marriage. But one night when Chuck was delivering packages during a nasty thunder storm, lighting hit the plane and it crashed! So then Chuck gets abandoned on this island and spends the next 4 years surviving on a island! One funny thing about the movie is that there is this volleyball and he paints the face of it with his blood and he makes it his best friend! It was a very strong movie and Tom Hanks did a really good job in this movie. Good movie, highly recommended.",10
10 November 2013,what i learned,"I realized many important lessons of life from this movie. *The importance of easily available resources like water, food,first aid without which our life can turn hell. *The importance of being with other people, without them we will go MAD. *The importance of taking risks, without which we will be stranded forever. *The importance of accepting situations, without which we can not survive. Everyone should always be aware that Life can turn upside down at any point of time. So this movie made me realize that we should learn to adapt ourselves with any situation.

There is so much to learn from this movie. Entire team of Cast Away deserves to be appreciated.

16 May 2014,Great movie,"The greatest movie i have ever watched.

The struggle of tom hanks shown makes the movie forget. I liked Wilson the most in the film and tom hanks treats him as friend this concept is remarkable and that is the he does not tend to forget speaking as it has been long time 4 years. Planes crash looks like real.

The struggle shown for collecting food and water is amazing. The best scene in the movie is lighting fire. Finally he decides to move and build his own small ship to cross the huge ocean and he succeeds. Through out this journey he loses Wilson very emotional scene. Also he makes optimum use of parcels land with him at beach.

Great movie !!!

7 October 2014,Review,"Cast Away is survivalist film starring Oscar award winner, Tom Hanks, that takes place on an island in the South Pacific after a disastrous plane crash. The main character ,Chuck Noland who is played by Hanks, works for the FedEx company shipping packages around the world. During a storm, Noland's plane goes down and he is stuck on an island fighting for survival. Far away from home and any form of society he starts to break-down emotionally and physically. The plot of this film is the strongest story I've ever seen captured on film. This is probably the only film that can make me feel distraught over a man losing a volleyball. Chuck is battling loneliness and depression while he is trying to survive. Hanks' performance makes the story come alive and really immerse you. The reality of the plane crash and the island was incredible. To further the ""realness"" of the film, they include Chuck's desperation to get home as he paddles in his deflated raft trying to get over the waves. The director and actor really worked together to show the emotion and desperation of this man Chuck Noland. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies. The cinematography is lacking a little bit as it uses elementary camera shots and angles. However, the literary element makes up for what the cinematics lack.",9
17 January 2022,Great Classic!!,"Cast Away is an outstanding film. One of the great survivalist tales you'll ever see. The story is beautifully written and every scene after his abandonment bears so much weight and makes even simple things feel like huge challenges. Truly a cinematic masterpiece!

Tom Hank's performance was great, I think this is truly Hank's career-defining performance. It captures everything that is magnificent about him: effortless likability, pure commitment, humor, ethos, pathos. It's a timeless movie just as good today as when it came out in 2000.

18 February 2016,Hanks doesn't need anyone else around him to be amazing.,"Tom Hanks is an incredible actor. He never ceases to amaze his audience. He's truly alone in over two-thirds of Cast Away. Chuck (Hanks) is a Fed-Ex manager who ends up stranded on a small island after the plane crashes that he's aboard. Much hardship and toil follow, as Chuck tackles with the forces of nature. There are no stand-out scenes, no music, no non-diagetic sounds, only Hanks and the materials he can use around him. It's a absolutely phenomenal performance, sorrowful and weirdly joyful, with Hanks at his best when he's alone. His single friend, Wilson (a football), almost resonates human emotion through Hanks' communication with him. Robert Zemeckis has done well with relying on their solitary performer.

24 July 2015,FedEx not mentioned anywhere near enough at beginning,"I started watching Castaway thinking it would be just another Tom Hanks caper like Saving Private Ryan or Big. How wrong I was! Only saw the first few minutes, but for some reason I became so emotional at how great FedEx are that I just had to go and post something. If only FedEx appeared in more movies. I love FedEx. I doubt UPS have made such a fantastic appearance in ANY movie, EVER (they're so poop they'd probably be in a french film, ha!).

Anyway, Snickers also makes an appearance, but they're only mentioned in passing. I'm presuming that FedEx got something to Tom on the island, against the odds, and saved the day. I'd want FedEx to appear in my autobiography if I was parcel oriented.

Come to think about it, what really let down The Godfather was too few mentions of FedEx. If only Marlon Brando had said something like, ""I'm going to take him a parcel he can't refuse"" THEN it would have been a great film.

Anyway, I hope we won't have to wait too long for Castaway 2.",10
18 January 2001,Not bad but can be better,"The movie itself is good, story is excellent the thing is that there are lots of movies that shown someone or somebody stranded on an island.

Some movie critics might not find this interesting cause even myself have seen lots of movie which similar like this. The only thumb up is the story which can be say, excellent writing.

Especially the island segment. Watch Zemeckis at work. He captures the most bizarre sense of isolation.

Without the use of some sappy score or overly processed dream sequence, the film is all the more better.

As for those who think it was boring, I don't know... what were you expecting? A desert island shootout with mobsters, car crashes, government conspiracies and such? <laugh>.

27 March 2006,A thrilling though mainstream movie/infomercial,"Tom Hanks has a hell of a lot more talent than do I.He is not a cult member of Mormonism, since he only followed it in childhood. No,really. He is NOT a clone of the LDS church. Really. I really mean to assert that fact. He is in NO way an LDS operative in the film world. He just happened to stroll through the Mormon church, on his way to stardom. Let it be known that he has NO actual connection with the Mormon church. He is a quiet, less-demonstrative actor, who has a gift for understatement and beauty. Helen Hunt is a purely beautiful womanly woman. She gets to play The Girlfriend. Snore snore snore snore snore. Hanks embarks on an adventure that rips their beautiful high-toned suburban and corporate all-encompassing little capsular life into flotsam and jetsam, not necessarily in that order. Love rent asunder is always a Great Crime. I actually love the little infomercial for FedEx that permeates this movie, for I love the business of small business, grown into big business-the romance of it. Tom Hanks has two loves, Helen, and the quote-cult-unquote of FedEx. Hanks lives inside the huge global beautiful IDEA known as FedEx. I can so dig this feeling my brothers. A fake cult like Scientology just bleeds the life and time in your life-out of you. A business, like FedEx, like Branson's Virgin Enterprises, like Whole Foods, however, gives you life- as it actually PRODUCES something of value for the world. Apple Computers produces stuff people like-or so I am told. It is in some ways a ""cult"". That being said, Hanks is torn from these twin loves and somehow survives. He survives the loss yet is lost for all time, if not for a fortunate accident. His real loss is not fully realized until he returns to Earth (Tennessee), and then, is Cast Away. His life after all was just a roll of the die, cast.",5
6 January 2002,weak,"For a start you've got a premiss for a movie that pretty much gives the whole story away before you've even sat down to watch - you know this guy is going to get trapped on a desert island and you know he'll escape (this being Hollywood). So where's the surprise? Where's the hook?

Secondly, you realize this is a weak idea for a movie, pretty soon after Tom Hanks washes up onto the island. See, the beauty of a novel like 'Robinson Crusoe' is that it has the ability to express one man's loneliness on an island through the power of provoking images in your mind as you read. Of course film can't do that, at least not mainstream Hollywood film, so it's left to the director to patronize the audience because he believes we couldn't possibly cope with watching one man never talking, so he makes him talk to a soccer ball. Unbelievably, the director convinces us this is rational by displaying this as some kind of coping with loneliness and the onset of madness.

Another sign of its weakness is the incredibly bad fact that about three quarters of the way through there's a fade-out and the hugely weak concept of a ""FOUR YEARS LATER"" caption appears on screen, and suddenly we're transported to a long curly-haired bearded Hanks who somehow has survived all this time with no account of how.

Worst of all, this movie is disgusting in terms of the intense amount of product placement for FedEx, where their logo is shown in pretty much every shot. Is it a movie or merely a commercial? It doesn't even attempt to do this in a tongue-in-cheek way.

Also, the moment where Tom Hanks struts around banging his chest and shouting ""I have made fire!"" is possibly one of the most unintentionally horribly comic things I've ever seen.

'Cast Away' does score a few points in the fact that it's well shot, the plane crash is great, and it kept me watching, but it's a little too long, and frankly a pretty weak idea with a horrendous amount of product placement.",4
22 May 2002,"Survivor, Tom Hanks style","This movie is very good but the trailer gave away too much. It showed how he crashed and how he got off. I found it spoiling for me but it didn't stop me from going to see it, again and again. I bought this immediately on DVD, mainly for Tom Hanks performance. He did a very awesome oscar-nominated job playing a plane crash survivor, who learns how to survive on an island for however long he needed to stay. He even made a new friend on the island, a volleyball named Wilson. The movie itself is very good and I was rooting for Tom the whole way.

Overall the performances were excellent, the plot was great and I enjoyed every second of the movie. Rating 10 out of 10.

23 June 2020,King Hanks,"I like this movie. Good message on how you cant control life. Its very well done and it is not predictable. I think the beginning is a bit lack luster, it takes to long for anything to happen, the first 20 minutes seems like a FedEx commercial. But once the movie gets goin it REALLY gets goin. Tom Hanks has got to be one of the best actors that has ever been, i didn't particularly love his character in this, but he played it so well. Also Im not sure i love Helen Hunt, her and Tom Hanks don't have much chemistry in my opinion. But that's just one mans opinion. Fantastic Movie.

Emotions and bonding with his wife or with only object (football - Wilson) should have been shown better. I could not connect well with the the movie on emotional front. I don't know if I am very weird person to review with little negative things, but I write what I feel. I suggest people to watch TRAPPED(2016/17) as I find not many know about this ultimate thriller movie which I rated as 10.

9 October 2002,"If you've ever found yourself alone, you understand...","If you found no redeeming value or lesson to take with you after re-viewing this film, the boat passed you by. I didn't go see this movie at the theatre because the thought of watching an entire movie based on a lone man's experiences was not appealing. However, as is the case with many of Tom Hank's latest films, the message was more valuable than the price of a theatre ticket.

Many times in our lives we find ourselves alone on a metaphoric ""island"", isolated from everyone else as a result of some tragedy or unwelcomed consequence that has drastically affected our lives. And like Hanks' character, we find ourselves without the familiar surroundings or things we have taken for granted. So we struggle to learn again many processes and procedures that before were simple and available to us.

When the struggle becomes to much of a burden, we begin to wonder if it is worth the life that was presented to us at birth. If that hurdle is overcome, then you realize that faith in the next day is all you have for hope. And like Hanks' character was presented with material to form a sail to escape his predicament, we also carry the hope of surviving our experiences as a result of life's waves.

The soliloquy that he delivers toward the end of the movie is priceless. He sums up his fears, his challenges, his triumphs and his failures with the statement, ""I have to keep breathing. For tomorrow, the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring.""

The final scene with Hanks standing in the middle of a rural intersection is the icing on the cake. For when we survive our crises, we find ourselves at a crossroads with many roads to choose.",
28 May 2017,Very good film!1,"This is one of my favorite films. Good chosen actor's composition. This is film with a one cool actor. Tom Hanks perfectly played his role.

22 December 2000,Once again Hanks demonstrates his dynamic range.,"Cast Away - Life inexorably flows by: whether it's slowing down while we're at work, or speeding up when we're at play, days blend into weeks and into years. Not surprisingly, few people - especially those who would benefit from it most - ever take the time to engage in serious introspection. If, however, the opportunity did present itself, what do you think you might learn? Or would you even dare to try?

Chuck Noland is obsessed by time: it's his job is to ensure that those packages that ""absolutely positively have to get there overnight"" do, and he's willing to do what is necessary to get it done, even ""borrowing"" a child's bike if necessary. He loves his girlfriend, but their relationship is subject to the whims of his daytimer. Ripped away from yet another Christmas dinner for a quick job he gives his girlfriend a hurried kiss, tells her that he has something important to discuss with her and promises her he'll be right back. Of course, time is relative.

By now, everyone probably knows that this film is ""different"" in several ways. First, the concept and movie came before the witless ""Survivor"" phenom, and many people were concerned that the show might taint the movie. Second, many people were hoping for a repeat after Zemeckis and Hanks struck box office gold with ""Forrest Gump"". Third, after filming the beginning of the movie, the production went on hiatus for a year while Tom Hanks shed almost fifty pounds going from portly to waif (Zemeckis filled his time by filming ""What Lies Beneath""). Fourth, although there are peripheral characters, the bulk of the film focuses on Chuck's time alone on the island and consequently, dialogue is sparse. There is also an absence of special effects (with the notable of exception of the superbly staged plane crash), and the soundtrack stops soon after Chuck crawls ashore. Finally, the initial ending was scrapped after it garnered lukewarm responses from test audiences.

I never dreamed that the cross dressing star of a cheesy sitcom would one day be one of Hollywood's biggest draws. I'm sure he didn't either. It is difficult for an actor to give a good performance at the best of times, but when you are playing off a volleyball, water and occasionally adverse weather conditions, the situation is far more challenging. Hanks proves that he is up to the task.

Even starker than Hank's amazing physical metamorphosis, is his spiritual and mental transformation. As his carefully ordered life disintegrates (whose wouldn't after being jetwrecked?) Chuck begins to understand that what is truly important in life, water, food and shelter not withstanding, is living, not just surviving. As he struggles with desperation, triumph, and insanity, he accepts that he cannot dictate what happens, only his response. Could this have been the subtle reason for titling the film ""Cast Away"" (vb.- to dispose of something) rather than ""Castaway"" (adj.- a shipwrecked individual)? As I don't think I will be talking with speak with Mr. Zemeckis in the near future, it will remain unanswered.

The location shots are both beautiful and treacherous - paradise with a hitch - and reminded me of some of the islands I visited while in Fiji (thankfully they had places to stay and food I didn't have to hunt down). The cinematography is tight, and Zemeckis deserves congratulations for his simple, understated, yet simultaneously daring direction (if only he'd shown such restraint in ""What Lies Beneath""). My only complaints would have to be that the beginning and ending feel too artificial when viewed in the context of the rest of the film, but not overwhelmingly so.

One of the most powerful films of the holiday season.",7
30 November 2017,Love this movie!,"I simply love this movie because of the uncertainty as regards to what happens next during the entire movie!

I find it hard to believe that Tom Hanks did not won a Oscar for his performance, since he in my opinion deserved it more than anyone else.

If you have not seen Cast Away yet, I definitely recommend you to see it right away. I promise you will be blown away by the story and the great performance by Tom Hanks.

All the best, Pernille

19 June 2001,Good Movie with Good Lessons,"Exceptional story of typical American corporate type who pushes and bullies foreign nationals on their own soil, (the suitcase full of American ingenuities like candy bars and portable CD players he used to ""tip"" the delivery boy was simply vile...), and develops a change of priorities when he's stranded on ""an unchartered desert isle."" The periods of silence and observance of the character was interesting, and much akin to the 1968 HELL IN THE PACIFIC. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, especially if they're weened on ""bang-zoom, where's-the-bodycount?"" type of entertainment.

The intelligence and interesting plot of this story clears lies in it's simplicity of story telling. Tom Hanks did a super job with the character, his strengths, frailties, and more importantly...his regrets. Helen Hunt was super as his girlfriend.

21 January 2002,Trying to survive what challenges life throws up to each individual,"In life we all make our mistakes. Some cost us very little, and others cost us a lot. Yet it is what we do about these mistakes that makes a person who and what they are. While it was a different movie to experience, Cast Away gives the viewer an incite into what it is like to try and survive after nearly losing their life, in addition it is a chance to see what it is like to have to go back to the basics, to see what is needed to have a second chance at living a normal' life again.

Chuck Noland, a FedEx systems engineer whose ruled-by-the-clock existence abruptly ends when a harrowing plane crash leaves him isolated on a remote island. As Chuck struggles to survive, he finds that his own personal journey has just begun.

Cast Away is an extraordinary movie. It goes for almost half the time with no dialogue and only one actor on our screen. Yet the whole film works. The main star is Hollywood legend Tom Hanks who plays the stranded Chuck Noland. He is brilliant, with his role showing us how talented he really is. His on-screen presence made me at times happy and others sad. It would have been very taxing role for Hanks, yet I could not imagine anyone else doing it. In fact Hanks is rather unlucky not winning the academy award for best actor for this film, as he would have been a worthy recipient of the honour.

The other main star of Cast Away and an important friend for Chuck was Wilson. Wilson was just a volleyball, yet the relationship between him and Chuck was just great. This was an ingenious part of the film and one, which I will remember for a long time to come. Another significant part of this film is the delightful Helen Hunt, who plays Chuck's girlfriend Kelly Frears. The scenes that are between Hunt and Hanks are very touching, especially at the end of the film.

Cast Away was shot in one of the beautiful parts of our world  that being Fiji. The little island that was used was just beautiful and was the perfect place to shoot this film. All the time and effort spent to set this film up would have been very taxing on all involved, yet the end result was one great movie. Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job on this film, yet it was a shame that he allowed audiences to see far too much of the film in the trailers before the film was released.

If anyone was to actually go through what the character Chuck Noland experienced and survive then it would be a real miracle, and I guess there would be stories similar to this. This film is all about being able to go on against all the odds and making it, when everything says that you shouldn't. Cast Away for me had an ending that was adequate, yet I can understand people being left unsatisfied and mystified by it, with several questions being left unanswered. If you want to be left inspired that you can achieve anything, then sit down and get cast away!

9 January 2006,Cavernous apology of transcendental consumerism,"Replete with blatant contradictions, Cast Away serves as a highly interesting case study of Hollywood's dominating mood and the psychological repressions of mainstream American (and, by extension, so-called western) society. Its main tag line being that you need to free yourself from the material world in order to achieve true personal freedom, it paradoxically links all emotions to objects from the material world (volleyball, soda drink, ice cubes, skating shoes, football franchises, car etc.)  hence the shameless product placement that has rightly spurred harsh criticism, though cause and effect are certainly hard to disentangle. The plot itself illustrates this inherent struggle between materialism and spiritualism: the part dedicated to the protagonist's inner developments, devoid of musical score and with little dialogue (monologue, in fact), is squeezed in between two very talkative and, to say the least, corny accounts along the lines of before/after. However, what Zemeckis and Hanks attempt to achieve in the long run is no less than the reconciliation of both worlds. At the end of the inward journey stands the morale that consumerism and personal emotional fulfillment are only seemingly opposites. They can be pacified provided the individual, precisely by identifying with the objects he produces  by humanizing them, as it were (Wilson)  gains detachment from the the material world and, more prosaically, transcends the ugly things in life. And what better way to hit that home than to use real, existing brands that every movie goer in the western hemisphere can relate to? (In a way, the question as to whether or not the makers of the film should have preferred imaginary brands has no incidence.) In this perspective, Zemeckis's tale is the diametrical opposite of Robinson Crusoe, who chose to live as a free individual, distrustful of what he perceived as civilisation, whereas Chuck Noland's sole aspiration is to return amidst his peers after an incidental cathartic incursion into the cavernous shell of his inner life. In other words, where Defoe outlines utopia, Zemeckis casts dystopia. As such, the metaphor spun here constitutes a deliberate attempt to rid the sphere of culture of its persistent, though mostly latent or repressed, bad conscience when it comes to financial issues getting in the way of artistic license. Similarly, it exempts audiences at large from having to resolve the negative equation of art vs commerce, of spirit vs money, etc, thus consolidating the conservative liberal economical stance so well embodied by Tom Hanks and FedEx alike. Quite openly it says that you shouldn't feel guilty for liking products as they are part of your emotional fabric  a semantic twist more commonly known as branding. The other dominating theme in Noland's emancipation is masculinity. The character's deep psychological turmoil is chastely symbolised by the island, with its moist cavern and erect mountain. The underlying assertion is that Noland needs to crawl out of his allegedly safe hole and climb the phallic hill to restore his deficient masculinity, the very premise to reintegrate a self-assertive modern society. Ultimately, his restored maleness allows him to let go of his former love, who returns to her new family and thus reinstates (Christian) moral order embodied by the institution of marriage. In line with this bigot mentality, sexuality is alway only addressed in germ-free metaphors. Have you noticed that the lush atoll is practically devoid of animals other than meaty crabs and the occasional fish? Where are the birds, snakes, worms, spiders and the armies of undefined crawling species that you're entitled to expect in the wild? Artistically speaking, the film has a handful of redeeming qualities, one being obviously its sheer length, the freedom it takes to deploy its story, thin by modern action standards, while nonetheless omitting or merely evoking certain episodes or riddles, a choice which runs counter to current cinema viewing habits. (Incidentally, that is precisely why so many people on this site have complained about the missing suicide attempt, the undisclosed content of the parcel and the open end; it would seem that today's movie goers can no longer bear that something is not explained to them didactically, explicitly.) But all things considered, the contrite redemption theme used to validate a consumerist society and its ethic corollary, fundamental religious values, makes Cast Away a disturbing illustration of a dominant (white male) ideology. As such, it is clearly propagandist, in all senses of the word.",5
28 December 2000,The better side of Zemeckis,"We take our lives for granted. It may be normal and ordinary for us to use the instruments of necessities. The 21st century man and woman have molded with technology to survive. But what if all of the daily use of equipment is taken away from you, would you survive? With Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) he has to escape the modern technology world and survive with very little in the new film, CAST AWAY. Chuck Noland is a Fed Ex employee who has very little time, he dictates some Russians on how speed does make a difference when it comes to delivering a package. Anc Chuck doesn't even have much time to spend the Christmas holiday with his love, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) since Chuck has to go overseas to help aid another Fed Ex station. On route back to the U.S., over the south Pacific the jumbo Fed Ex cargo plane crashes killing the all of the crew and nearly killing Chuck. Chuck then arrives on a deserted island, realizing that a man who was rushing with time, now has all the time in the world as he is isolated from civilization. Chuck has to find ways to survive, he writes on a giant boulder with a smaller stone, he spears fishes with a sharp bamboo stick, and it is almost a miracle when he starts a fire. With some Fed Ex boxes from the crash arriving on shore, Chuck makes the best use of them. He uses video tape for rope, a garment for a fishing net, and for companionship to keep his sanity he uses a volleyball as a head and names the ball ""Wilson."" I predicted back in July that CAST AWAY was going to be the better Robert Zemeckis film compared to WHAT LIES BENEATH (don't believe me, check out my WHAT LIES BENEATH review). And several months later I was right, CAST AWAY was far much better than WHAT LIES. I really enjoyed the symbolism of CAST AWAY, how can modern man survive in the wild. Zemeckis goes into much detail on how difficult it took the character of Chuck Noland to survive, with eating, shelter, and sanity. Zemeckis also shows some pretty graphic scenes on how Nick gets rid of a bad tooth. The movie is 138 minutes, and a little over a hour has Hanks alone on the island. And to carry a movie like this, a great actor needs to do a excellent performance, and Tom Hanks does it very well! Leave it to Tom Hanks to give another brillant performance in this film, which I feel should probably be his third Oscar win. Along with PHILADELPHIA, FORREST GUMP, BIG, APOLLO 13, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the role of Chuck Noland is a memorable performance in Hanks' career. Hanks adds humor, sadness, and pain as the role of the sole survivor who goes through a adventure to survive. And what a adventure! There are plenty of exciting scenes to keep any viewer's attention through out the entire movie. I would like to see Kelly, Rudy, and Richard from t.v.'s ""Survivor"" to have the same necessities that Chuck has in the film to survive the island for about five years. The only flaw is that there are some scenes that have the adventures similar to a thrill ride, but there are some very slow scenes here and there. But why bicker? CAST AWAY is easily one of the best films of 2000, and another excellent film to add to the impressive list of Tom Hanks' career. Just like FORREST GUMP, the partnership of Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks would deliver a great film, and CAST AWAY is another film that delivers. Don't miss it! ***** (out of five)",
9 July 2018,I nearly cried over a volleyball,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",10
13 January 2001,Without the Stars would anyone see this?,"While watching this movie I was reminded of something I had seen on TV about how Castaway could not have succeeded if it weren't for a big name actor in the lead. And that is what the result of the movie was.

There are a couple of major flaws in the movie as I see it. First of all there was not enough character developement. You would think a movie about a guy stranded on an Island with nothing but a volleyball for company would be heavy on the character. For the most part that isn't true. We see a couple of sudden jumps rather than a gradual changes. And suddenly it is four years later? I think that this is one case when a movie should have been much longer. The island could have been extended at least half an hour and made the movie a better effort.

1 May 2020,Cast away review.,"Tom Hanks I one of my fav actors so it wasn't much of a suprised that I like this movie like a lot. I even loved Wilson a ton. Tom Hanks did a great job in this movie he was acting by himself for most of the movie but did a fantastic job. This movie was super emotional too. The plot, storyline, characters, character development are all really good. This is a survival, plane crash, life kind of movie. I liked that Tom Hanks character liked working at fx a lot. The love he had for his wife seemed so real. The romance was so good and the chemistry was great. Every scene in this movie was done so well. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves ton Hanks acting or even if you don't like his acting you should still see this movie it that good.

5 February 2004,Teriffic movie.,"A Man who relies upon his business to make a living is suddenly stranded on a remote island where there is not a piece of technology around to help him. Struggling to just stay alive, he also struggles to attain his insanity and human spirit. Tom Hanks gives an impressive, respect worthy performance as our survivor. We are with him from the beginning and we find ourselves caring for the character so much. Hanks is so good in his role that when he starts comunicating with Wilson the volleyball (who is very likeable, despite the fact he is simply a blown up piece of sports equipment), we actually think that Wilson is a real spirit. Excellent movie and highly recomended. The only downside to this caper is that it is, too, long.

2 January 2001,9 on a scale of 10,"There is a lot to say about this movie. It was 2 hours 23 minutes, but had about 6 hours of memories. The airplane scene was a classic. Nothing in a movie terrifies me, but I have to say that was about as terrifying a scene as you will ever see. The most amazing thing is that it held you in terror for what must have been 10 minutes.

There were a number of other times that the movie caused you to cringe in perceived pain. And, each time set a new standard. Half the audience hid their head and the other half closed their eyes. We all knew what was going to happen.

But, that aspect of the movie was only a part of the overall experience. It was also a powerful movie about the human spirit - about courage - about endurance. It is impossible to fully appreciate what it would have been like, but CAST AWAY did a pretty good job of helping us to imagine it.

Also, it was a rather moving love story as the Hanks character was in love with the Hunt character all the years he was stranded on the island. When they were reunited, it was truly one of the great scenes ever in movies. The conflict between desire and reality was extremely intense.

No pat endings, but definitely symbolism - and a sense of coming full circle. You felt sorry for him, but you also wish you could have the freedom that he obtained after he escaped the island. And, I don't mean just the freedom from being stranded. I mean the mental freedom of knowing who you are and knowing what is important.",9
10 July 2023,The CAST collaboration of Tom Hanks and Wilson Really Blows Viewers AWAY,"This is a fantastic film. The storyline might have been simple and straightforward, but it took the film to new heights. It was really well executed and the cast was phenomenal. This is a real story of strength and survival.

Tom Hanks was the right choice for the lead for this film. He truly has the very knowledge to bring his character roles to life. To have his character communicate and build a relationship with an unanimated object is a great addition to the storyline. With this added into the film, viewers receive the insight and perspective of the characters.

I enjoyed this film. It was original and it had the real aspects and clear message of what the storyline was about.

13 July 2001,great movie,"I don't think I need to give a plot synopsis; I'm sure you know what it's about. Tom Hanks (as usual) gives another good performance. Seeing him struggle to live on the island, the film generates a good deal of sympathy, and you find yourself really feeling for him. The airplane crash sequence is intense. Helen Hunt was just her usual self, but she's not too bad. Alan Silvestri's score (what little there was, about 15 minutes or so, and none of it heard until the final half-hour) was effective. My only complaints: the final half-hour was a bit overlong, and I wish that instead of cutting from Chuck's early days on the island to ""Four Years Later"" that they had shown a montage or something to let us see what all he went through during that time, especially how he found a way to set up a calendar system using the sunlight in the cave. But that aside, CASTAWAY is a great film that, at 2 hours and 25 minutes, flies by like 15 minutes. Robert Zemeckis remains high on my list of favorite directors.

2 January 2001,Just ok...,"I left the theatre thinking ""Well, I probably won't remember this movie in six months."" I mean, it's ok, just no big deal. The island part was fine and I didn't miss the lack of dialog, although I think I would be talking out loud once in awhile if that were me. I also saw no chemistry between Hanks and Hunt (do we have any other actresses working lately - please?). Hanks was good as usual, but something is missing in this movie.

2 June 2002,**SPOILERS** Well-made but unsatisfying **SPOILERS**,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away.

5 May 2001,Even Tom Hanks can't solve all problems,"What a time everyone would have, moaning about this movie if Tom Hanks weren't in it - too long; too thin; disjointed; inconclusive ending; longest product placement in the history of cinema! But because of his presence most of these criticisms fade away, and in any case the film probably wouldn't have been made without him. The majority of the audience, including me, are happy to watch Hanks, whatever he's doing on screen, because of his charisma and sheer acting ability.

But there are some faults with this movie that Hanks cannot solve, and at least one where he must bear some responsibility. To start with the latter, I just don't think he does enough in the early scenes to make Chuck Noland the time-driven man that the movie needs to make its point that there is more to life than rushing around, watching the clock, and meeting deadlines. Yes, he's a busy, diligent executive, who possibly cares as much for FedEx as for his lover Kelly (Helen Hunt), but on a personal level he doesn't come over as particularly harrassed or obsessive; I don't really take him seriously when he's shouting at the Russian operatives.

We must blame the producers and director, Robert Zemeckis, for other problems. A major one is that by omitting a proper rescue scene the movie misses an opportunity for dramatic action (and good-feel action to balance the all-too-realistic air-crash) and also cheats the audience of the release of emotion and tension it deserves after sticking with Chuck through his long ordeal. The cut from the moment of rescue to Noland a few weeks later flying home is too abrupt.

Another complaint is that, though I have no quarrel with the ending as regards the plot, the locale where Bettina Peterson lives, which we've also seen at the beginning of the movie, is just too empty, flat and boring. I'm sure Zemickis had good reasons for choosing this location, but he doesn't seem to have had the visual appearance of the movie much in mind. (If he simply wanted to convey remoteness, why not have her live in the mountains or deep in the everglades!)

Hanks has now become a movie icon in a very literal sense - the audience enters a cinema where he is starring with much the same feeling of veneration as does the congregation entering a church. This near-idolatry is reinforced by the parts he plays - almost invariably men of charm, integrity, and in Cast Away courage, tenacity and resourcefulness. It would do both him and his fans good to play a less saintly role; and this may be the case in The Road to Perdition, now in production, where he's due to play a killer.",7
13 June 2001,A resplendent spiritual journey.,"Even slight flaws appear to loom larger when embodied in a near perfection. The few defects, however, do not mar the overall excellence of this fine production. Here, we learn once more that our journey through life might not be what we expected and that it might hold challenges that will in the end make us stronger. The spiritual depth of this film is profound. At a more superficial level, it is an engrossing adventure, a story not just about love but how badly we humans need each other for our happiness.

Robert Zemeckis, by this creation, seems to have blossomed from an imaginative filmmaker to one of penetrating depth. Like Frank Capra before him, Zemeckis draws upon the subtle whispers of the spiritual realm beyond and in so doing, has delivered to us a timeless movie.

25 July 2023,"Hanks with a volleyball, came close to winning his third Oscar","You can call it a one-man show. Yes, the film focuses on Tom Hanks' solo performance, and his ability to carry the film with such depth and nuance is a testament to his talent as an actor. He only missed his third Oscar, losing to another spetacular performance from Russell Crowe in Gladiator.

The cinematography complements the film's themes of isolation and survival. It captures the beauty and harshness of the island, contributing to the film's immersive and atmospheric experience.

""Cast Away"" explores themes of survival, resilience, human connection, and the value of time. It delves into the essential human need for companionship and the emotional toll of being separated from society.

28 December 2000,Without a doubt one of the years best films.. no question about it.,"Unlike last year, this year didn't have as many good movies as last, but this year is definately not a bad year. Last night (my birthday) I saw ""CAST AWAY"" and let me start by saying that I expected A LOT, I've known about this movie for a little over a year and I couldn't wait to see it. I thought I may have been dissapointed that it may be too long, or even too boring, but it was far from it.

This is a wonderfully created picture, I thought it was done so well on so many levels. Many people I heard were not happy with the ending, but I won't say anything except, I wasn't..

thats all I have to say about that (the ending)

Like always, Tom Hanks is fabulous in this, not only does the audience feel like they are on the island with him, they feel his emotions, especially in the scenes with Wilson (who deserves an academy award for best supporting object)

This movie is defiantely one unforgetable picture and if not number one, one of the top five best movies of the year.

No. Neither did a Fed-ex employee, till he hit the deadly ground of the tiny island in Pacific. Great story for a movie, huh?

A story who cries out to become a masterspiece movie. Did it?

Well Tom Hanks proved once more that he is one of the best actors around (although he proved his talent much more in academy awarded Philadelphia and Forrest Gump), Heln Hunt did his part correctly, while others are un-noticed.

Why didn't I grade this movie better? Hmm, mostly it was too long...there are some scenes which are totally unnecessary, and I guess that this is the director's blame. Plus there are some minor things that bothered me...for instance...after the crash he collected all of the crates, but he opened it in a day or two. Why? I guess everyone would opened the crates imidiatly. Don't you agree? He might found a cellular phone in it:)

At its core, it is the story of a man who survives a plane crash and lives for four years alone on a deserted Pacific island. But it also deals with the profound changes in its hero's life after his rescue, wrought by four years in isolation under circumstances that had long ago convinced all his friends and loved ones that he was dead. In a role in which many actors might have been tempted to eat the scenery, Tom Hanks is restrained and always believable. ""Cast Away"" avoids easy answers, so it is ultimately ambiguous and a little sad -- as parts of all of our lives are ambiguous and a little sad.

Not to be missed. 10 out of 10.

13 April 2002,Two-thirds of a good movie (major spoilers),"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",6
28 March 2001,*** 1/2 Needs a middle,"Tom Hanks' amazing performance is the best reason to watch this excellent drama directed by Robert Zemeckis. The second of two films Zemeckis made in the year 2000 (the other being What Lies Beneath) this is definitely not the superior of the two but is still a worthwhile tale of a Federal Express supervisor stranded on a deserted island for four years after his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Helen Hunt plays the devoted girlfriend who doesn't know to wait for him back home. The film is painfully missing a middle, so once the scenes of isolation are (quickly) over, one is led to believe that Hanks' readjustment to the so-called normal society back home is really the heart of the story. Sadly, this aspect of the plot is also underdeveloped, leaving a good movie that doesn't quite know what it's about.

25 December 2000,"Truly one of the best films of 2000.Tom Hanks best performance since ""Philadelphia"".","""Cast Away"" is a wonderful film with an excellent performance by Tom Hanks that deserves to be recognized by the academy.I left the theater, not being able to forget how emotional the movie ran through me.At a full two hours and thirty five minutes,I was entertained by Tom Hanks' performance which made me feel the same kind of emotions that I had when I had seen ""Philadelphia"".Tom Hanks is a Fed-Ex delivery executive who happens to be in a plane that crashes into the ocean.He drifts onto an island where he is forced to spend four years on a deserted island.On that island,he must learn to survive and fight for his sanity.Tom Hanks has delivered some of the most incredible performances in his acting career and his second collaboration with director Robert Zemeckis is a real treat for fans of Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis.Tom Hanks is well supported by Academy Award winner Helen Hunt,whose performance should be recognized with another Academy Award nomination.And I mean should,because she deserves it.Even if she doese not win,she should be recognized by the academy.Director Robert Zemeckis brings the audience into a spectacular,beautiful world.Choosing the locations set on the islands and the ocean were a breathtaking experience.The cinematography and the score are among the film's best contributions.""Cast Away"",along with ""Forrest Gump"",""The Hurricane"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a must see.Take the time to see ""Cast Away"" because you will walk out that theater feeling good inside yourself.""Cast Away"" is truly one of the best films of 2000 and Tom Hanks proves that he scores.My vote for this film:One of the best films of 2000.",8
25 July 2021,It takes its time but it's worth the wait!,"The start is probably the slowest part of the movie but is also the part with the most character development. Obviously the movie had to start slow to build up tension for the inevitable disaster that takes place. It does this really well but could probably have been a bit faster. The moment of the plane crash is absolutely horrifying, it's done so extremely well. Once he is stranded on the island, the music cuts off and really emphasises his loneliness. The acting is spectacular but after the huge skip in time the movie becomes extremely predictable. This predictability makes the movie rather dull but it still manages to create an atmospheric and sad ending really well. The whole romantic side is a bit overplayed and annoying but it all works out well in the end :)

22 June 2001,Average for a Tom Hanks outing,"Cast Away was only an average Tom Hanks movie, which does means it was better than a lot of the major studio stuff out there, but it was nowhere up to the level of Philadelphia or Forest Gump.

I liked the fact that the ending was the way it was...not necessarily happy, not necessarily sad, and I liked the look of the island that Hanks was marooned on. The one problem I had with the film was that there was no initial indication that a FedEx executive would've had all of the survival skills that Hanks exhibited...but I suppose that there really would've been no way to foreshadow that in the opening part of the storyline. I would have also liked the film to delve more into what Hanks was thinking while on the island...perhaps digging a bit more into his past. It seemed his life began and ended with Helen Hunt...there had to be more to what made him who he was than just her.

I viewed the DVD version of the film and found most of the second disc to be pretty lame...the survivalist featurette was interesting at times, but the Wilson featurette was lame...I know why the ""character"" was there and why there was a need for it, but to overly glamourize it like had been done was just dumb.",7
28 February 2004,Two Movies In One,"Cast Away was two films - one that I very much liked sandwiched between two that I found dull.

As it opens, Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a time obsessed slightly rotund Fed Ex executive. He has everything is life - a good family, a good job, a nubile girlfriend (Hunt). He leaves on Christmas eve for an undefined emergency and has to fly overseas. The plane goes down and the meat of the movie begins.

The second act of Cast Away is brilliant. Hanks is marooned on a island after the plane crash and director Robert Zemeckis makes some very daring moves to strand us with him. No music. Noe other characters. No animals to befriend. And most importantly, no flashbacks to life back home without him. The only other cast member is a volleyball that Hanks uses to maintain his sanity.

The acting here is particularly great, since it is so isolated. We get to sense the various stages that he goes through - shock, desperation, survival, a touch of insanity. This is a performance that truly draws you in.

From this point the movie slides down a rather slippery slope of mediocrity largely due to the performance of Hunt. I have seen Cast Away a few times, and I am so exhilarated by the second act and so let down by the third. See it for yourself and you can judge.

Still, the Cast Away's middle act occupies the lion's share of the film and makes the entire experience more than worthwhile. *** out of ****.",
9 August 2003,Walk Away From Cast Away,"After a friend recommend this film to me after crying during the viewing of it- I had to see what the fuss was all about. Tom Hanks plays the role of a FedEx worker who is stranded on an island. He's out in the middle of nowhere so the life that he had is basically no more. This movie is so sappy that I wanted to throw up. I had no connection with Tom Hanks' character whatsoever. Once you see this you'll think, ""Why didn't he just _________ to leave the island?"" If this movie would have starred me, it would have lasted 10 minutes because I would have found some way to get off that island in no time at all. The movie was boring because all you deal with is Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks, and more Tom Hanks. He's a good actor, no doubt about that, but seeing him for 2 hours straight gets boring. Plus, this movie was too drawn out. The film tried too hard to be something it never could be. I give this movie a 2 out of 10.

26 June 2001,TOM HANKS IS AMAZING IN THIS FILM,"Tom Hanks is an amazing actor. He dominates ""Cast Away"" so fully that one doubts it could have made without him. He should have won his record third Oscar, but the Academy, in their usual good judgment (I'm being sarcastic),chose Russell Crowe for ""Gladiator"". Boy, did they miss the boat on this one.

Hanks is pretty much alone for about 110 minutes of this 143 minute feature. I'm not going to spoil it for you since the advertising teams from Fox and Dreamworks have done such a good job already (sarcasm again) Not knowing anything about the film is a major benefit. I don't pay attention to ads and I was able to appreciate the film's surprises.

I loved the fact that it records an existence. So many filmmakers today think you have to have wall to wall action in order to keep an audience interested. But Hanks and the director, Robert Zemeckis, understand that a good story and solid characterization are even more effective. This is another winner from Zemeckis, who has been making one great film after another lately (""Forrest Gump"", ""Contact"", the chilling ""What Lies Beneath""; actually he has yet to make a bad film). The film's Panavision photography (by Don Burgess) resembles Kubrick's ""2001"" and George Stevens' ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" in making wide open vistas claustrophobic.

Just because I really, really liked this film doesn't mean it's flawless. ""Cast Away"" has some problems. One is the ending. While I appreciate the fact that Zemeckis didn't tack on a sentimental, syrupy ending, the final shot of Hanks in this film comes off as forced. This is probably a compromise with the studios and I don't blame Zemeckis, Hanks or even the screenwriter. Another is Helen Hunt. Nothing personal, but she has yet to find a role that can eclipse her Oscar-winning work in ""As Good As It Gets"". Here, she has a nothing part that could have been more substantial. ""What Women Want"" also had that problem and she was the LEAD! Here's to hoping that she'll find a good, juicy role worthy of her talent. If there's one thing I hate, it's squandered talent.

Still, ""Cast Away"" offers many pleasures and is riveting filmmaking from start to finish. This film deserved better treatment from the Academy. But since when does the Academy actually do that? The answer is hardly ever. Shame.

**** out of 4 stars",
1 June 2002,WHO thought this was a good movie?,"In the first fifteen minutes, the director asks me to believe (and care about) the absolutely most impossibly ridiculous plane crash/survival sequence in history. If you want me to like a film, don't insult me technically, ever. And if you attempt that, give me a reason why. A giant plane nose-dives into the Pacific. It breaks in half. Tom Hanks swims free, unharmed. But there's a jet turbine still menacing on the surface? What? The brain of the plane is dead and sunk. What's spinning this thing? From there, the movie escalates in sheer stupidity. The man risks his life for a basketball. For God's sake.

18 July 2001,A touching movie,"I think this movie was a good one, because it has some touching scenes in which Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) had to try to get out of the island, he suffered a lot, and also got hurt because of rocks, waves, etc. His teeth also hurt, I was impressed as he hit one of his teeth with a stone. I thought I had my teeth like that for a minute, It hurts me a lot, sometimes I think about somebody who suffers because of the teeth, it's horrible to have a pain like that, so it makes this movie very different and really touching. The plot is excellent, it has a lot of interesting things like a true love, but at the same time it turns like an impossible love. When Chuck Noland finally got to get out of the island, he found out that the love of his life got married to somebody else, and also had a little baby. This movie is very realistic, Tom Hanks really seems older when he got back home, but it's because the film was halted for a year, so it makes it a very realistic movie. I enjoyed this movie a lot. The scene when he thought that he had a volleyball for a friend was touching as well as funny and sad, I think when anybody is alone, they can think anything for having friends, even if the friend was a volleyball. This movie is very good, you should see it, and think a little about it.",8

6 July 2001,"The most beautiful thing in the world is the world itself""","Cast Away is a powerful and fascinating movie and one of those kind movies we rarely see today. Despite its long time, it's not boring and every sequences is worth watching. The story deals with issues which is forgotten these days, such as humanity, nature, world. Watching Tom Hanks marooned in a deserted island, confronting the force of nature and talking with his new and only friend Wilson makes me compare early people at the cave age when a piece of stone and two pieces of a wood values as a gold, and today people who have everything but nothing. Sometimes I rather have a stone and a ball as a friend and live in such a peaceful place than have a knife and an enemy disguised as a friend. The movie also wants to teach us some important thing that: Hope is the only thing that keeps you alive when you observe no relief, and with hope you can survive. Really ""The most beautiful thing in the world is the world itself"".

1 June 2019,What a great classic.,"Obviously I am many years behind with this review, but it is only a proof of how this classic despite the age, is still able to deliver an enormous satisfaction in its theatrical form. Cast Away is a film that I like to use quite like the example of good cinema; it is a film with a simple premise, simple in his veins but with a fantastic execution, fun and emotional. It is an art of being able to see it, entertaining from top to bottom, full of classic moments that we can remember forever, moments that are already captured as part of the history of cinema.

Everything inside the movie is great, I was sincerely hoping to see something simple with a little adventure, but ended up being a trip quite emotional and passionate about the survival story of a poor FedEx worker who ends up spending years lost along with nothing but his companion mind, which makes great use with the classic ball, Wilson.

And practically, these are the two protagonists of the film, although if there are several characters, the story itself is concentrated in Chuck, perfectly personified by Tom Hanks, achieving that we have a great affection for the person and his interaction with the world around him. Finishing with an excellent and simple end, emotional and moving, a classic instant that despite the years, must be seen.",8

1 March 2004,"A good adventure, a joy","Hey, an enjoyable film even though Im not too much a Hanks fan. Type of story has been done before. That is the loner, survivor, castaway struggling with the elements. Even in a tropical setting. Hanks survives a plane crash, the sole survivor in fact, & is marooned on an island for 4 years. It's a tropical island which means he can sustain himself food wise from the tropical fruits & vegetation as well as with fish. His whole life changes emotionally & literally. After he's rescued by a passing cargo ship he comes home to find his wife re-married with a child. Heartbreaking, but what was she supposed to do with him missing!? Carry on of course. The story seems to be left open for a sequel if you can believe it. We'll see. But the same sort of Robinson Cruesoe situation was done in a silent film called White Shadows in the South Seas(1928).

19 February 2001,While the Cast are away,"This is clearly a subject which easily captures the human imagination but I will give Zemeckis his due credit, in that I although I groaned at the prospect of two and a half hours of learning to catch fish, light a fire etc, etc, my need to get up and move on remained on hold. So. Good points? An impressive air crash with an underwater ballet reminiscent of Tom Hanks trying to reach a Normandy beach. A wonderful sense of the power and beauty of tides, both in their height, as Hanks battles against them, and their omnipresence as beautifully portrayed from the island mountain top panorama. But most of all for me was the middle of the night eyeball with an enormous whale. Did we dream that?

7 September 2002,It didn't seem long,"I was surprised to read after seeing ""Cast Away"" that it is almost three hours long. I didn't squirm as I usually do while watching a movie of that length.

So that speaks well for the movie. However, I didn't think it was a super wonderful movie either.

Roger Ebert complains in his review that Zemekis and company revealed too much of the plot in the trailer for ""Cast Away."" I concur with Ebert, although I may have come by my prior knowledge by reading reviews or talking to people who saw the movie.

The ending was a good idea with our protagonist meeting the woman who sent the FedEx package at the beginning of the movie (classic envelope pattern). But it wasn't filmed well (with Hanks standing in the middle of a dusty Texas intersection, pondering which direction to take next). I wish it had been more like the ending to ""Heaven Can Wait"" when the man and the woman started talking, and it was clear they were going to hook up.

I would have given ""Cast Away"" a rating of 6 but raised it to 7 because the movie didn't seem as long as it was.",8
2 April 2001,Wilson the Volley ball ROCKS!,"After enduring stuff like The Beach, Castaway (the boring TV series), and the hideous Temptation Island, this sand-surf-and-sun drama is more entertaining than the rest of the genre by far.

Mr Hanks was extremely good in this film. He plays his character Chuck convincingly. When he ends up marooned on the island, you really feel for the poor guy. I even asked myself - why didn't he try to make a fire earlier - especially when he's waving and yelling at the light far out to sea - and it's night!! But then we remember he is an urbanite stuck on this small island in the middle of the pacific, and these logical things wouldn't come easily at first to the mind of a city dweller....

The main story of this film isn't so much his life on the island (and Tom Hanks portrays this excellently), but the way Mr Hanks rebuilds his life once he gets back home. I was rather disappointed, because it would've made more sense to see how he managed to survive on the island for 4 whole years. The long final third of the flick (when he's home again) could've been reduced to maybe 20 minutes.

The plane crash is one of the scariest I've seen in a flick. Also the best action scene in this film. For fans of action, this will NOT be the movie for them. Admittedly, its a sad reunion at the end, and things don't turn out in a typical Hollywood Cliche manner.

CONCLUSION? Wilson the volley ball ROCKS! No, only kidding!!!",7

A long go-nowhere Fed/Ex and Wilson Volleyball commercial that didn't properly analyze the true ramifications of Hanks' isolation, spent too long on his life while trapped - we've seen this before and Zemeckis offered no new insight, and didn't believably portray what one would experience in that situation - and had a resoundingly unappealing and unsatisfying finish. Pure garbage. Don't bother, regardless of what you've heard - this is a stinker.

27 August 2001,"OK, but with a script by JG Ballard it could´ve been great","Quite interesting and engaging despite som cliched moments. The psychology of Hanks character is quite shallow and traditional, I wanted to know more, about his thoughts and dreams beyond merely wanting to return to civilization. I wish the script could have been written by JG Ballard. The plane crash is spectacular, as is some of the panoramas of the island, and I like Zemeckis restrained use of music. I think there´s no score for nearly 90 min, which is really nice in a Hollywood movie. But when it does surface, it is of course the same romantic nonsense we´ve heard a million times before. Despite that, the ending was better than I expected and it has a quite nice epilogue.

30 January 2001,blast away,"after all, it's not just about a drifted man like robinson crusoe story...

basically the movie is divided into three segments:

the first part is the 'normal'-modern life of chuck. very related to us, hardly use his feeling, all things revolve around logic and routines.

the middle part (and the tiresome one) off course is the drifted part. where he was sucked back into stone age. where he has to recollect his basic nature as human being, not as a civilized person.

and the last part is the reunion; not with his girlfriend, but with his lost humanity.

like painting, the style and the gradient is much like forrest gump; telling us about how uncertain life is. but this one tells you more transparent message.

the most touching moment is when chuck telling himself that 'i'm so sad that i lost her. but i'm very glad she's there with me all the time..' it is indeed a mature way to deal with loosing someone you love.

cast away is more a spiritual story than just an adventure movie. it is indeed a must for everyone who's been questioning about our everyday life. it is a reflection of how you deal with difficulties in life and how you handle towards god's plans.

a parallel course with 'alive', but with more deep enlightment.

a must-see for anybody who wishes to recollect their value of relationships, with others and with god.

-x-",
28 January 2001,blast away,"so this movie is not about a man drifted in a far away island after all...

the beginning tell us about the personal profile of a guy named chuck who lives in a modern life.

the middle part is about how he a drift back towards stone age, apart from any contact and civilization.

the last part is how he manage to continue his life again, including the conclusion and the wisdom of the movie.

apart from the usual high class acts, the interpersonal relationships brought up in this movie is very colourful and interesting. more than just how you should live your life, but also how to let go and go on with your life.

also how we have to behave towards god's plans.

the most touching revelation is how chuck tell himself, 'i'm so sad of loosing her, but i'm grateful that she always been there with me all the time...'

it is indeed a mature thinking towards letting go and positive thinking.

a must for those who dealt with everyday life and problems. this movie story is parallel with 'alive', but bear more deeply meditation and wisdom.

a perfect movie to be seen with those important to you. -x-",

It doesn't help much if the movie's main, and for a good while ""only"", character is a complete bore. I didn't care about him at all and after a while, got sick and tired. The movie runs out of ideas before it even begins. Zemekis tried to do something new, I suppose, but wound up failing miserably to tell any sort of story. There's no interest whatsoever. A movie that should never have been made.

23 May 2015,Much better than I expected!,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball).

19 August 2001,Isolation and desolation to its' fullest,"Cast Away' (2000) 20th Century Fox/DreamWorks Pictures

Cast Away' enables a viewer to experience isolation and desolation like no other film in recent memory. Director Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath, Forrest Gump) crafts an ambitious and elegant story revolving around Chuck Nolan (Tom Hanks), a Fed EX employee who is stranded on a desert island for several years due to a horrific plane crash. Zemeckis makes no secret of handing over the complete second act to Hanks to retain the viewer's attention. No music, no 45-degree camera angles -just simple storytelling to demonstrate Hanks' isolation. Cast Away' is quite an achievement in terms of a film's power to play with the human emotion. This film is structured into three related yet completely different acts which all have a different story to tell. The film opens with an energetic and rowdy scene in Russia where Hanks's character is leading a giant Fed EX shipment. With the use of frantic editing and great camera tracking  including a p.o.v. shot from a Fed Ex package, Zemeckis demonstrates the importance of delivering packages on time. Here we see Hanks' character's obsession with his work in which he utters these great lines, ` We live and die by the clock. We must never allow ourselves the sin of turning our backs on the clock'. Yet, in watching the film closely, we see completely that Hanks had to have let go of this mantra to survive. Within this first act, we enter Hanks' life through an enormous Christmas dinner with his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) and discover all that Hanks has to live for. Cut quickly to a terrific plane crash sequence that comes completely unexpected in which our main character finds himself stranded on a deserted island with nothing but his sanity to keep him grounded. In this second act we are limited to extraordinary filmmaking with little use of dialogue and musical score. Instead, we are treated to Hanks' tour-de-force' performance in which he commands his screen presence. We see Hanks struggle with the impossibility of starting a fire from scratch; making acquaintances with a volley ball named Wilson' and deal with the inevitable possibility of never returning home. The third act is in essence a closure to all the events that have occurred in the film. Therefore, we will not go into detail, yet some might find the last act a tad disappointing, yet, it is evident that the filmmakers stuck with the most realistic ending possible.

As far as the film is concerned, it plays on no other level than human emotion. Zemeckis leaves us no choice but to sympathize with our beloved character as he struggles to maintain his dignity in a world where there is none. We also see our character struggle with an unbearable weight loss as he wrestles with famine in a place where food is scarce and loneliness inevitable. The best thing about this film are the subtle, yet present symbolic events or images that convey the notion that although we might seem alone- we never are. It might take a second viewing to notice these, but they are there - and that is just one of the many great elements that compose this great film.

Giancarlo's Rating: *** (out of four)",
27 December 2000,Flawed But Insightful Journey Into Loneliness,"Cast Away is Tom Hank's latest Oscar-hopeful performance, but rest assured, a nomination will not be garnered. Though the film is at its best when Hanks is in the drudges of loneliness, it fails to convince us of Hank's relationship with co-star Helen Hunt. Though their scenes together are few, it certainly detracts from the mood set throughout the film.

Cast Away begins by showing us Tom Hank's character as a man obsessed with time: he has to be, since he works for Federal Express. After saying goodbye to his wife (Helen Hunt, in a flat, one-note performance), he is in a plane crash that leaves the others dead and himself stranded on an island.

Time apart from loved ones and friends is an essential theme to Cast Away, that is, time should not be wasted - during his ordeal on the island, the pain Hanks feels is not for the loss of food, shelter, or material possessions. His inspiration for survival is the love of his life, Helen Hunt. During his stay on the island, his need for a companion grows to the point where he takes to talking to a volleyball. In fact, the most emotionally stirring scene takes place between he and the volleyball and not the ones with Helen Hunt: when sports equipment makes a greater impression with the audience than a top actress, there's something quite wrong.

Tom Hanks' performance as Chuck Noland may not be Oscar material, but it certainly is well-done, and the long stretches and scenes without much dialogue are enlivened by some funny instances and Robert Zemeckis ironically lush photography of the paradise-like island turned prison for Hanks.. There's also quite a few touches of irony in the film, and also inventiveness that comes in the way of Hank's novel uses of some of the FedEx packages that wash ashore with him.

For all the buzz that's been generated by this Hanks/Zemeckis project, the film lives up to it in the beginning and middle - but the end feels like it was hastily put together - the scenes between Hunt and Hanks feel contrived, the dialogue is flat, and they have zero chemistry. If only the film had ended 20 minutes sooner, the solitude and meaning of the film would have gained fantastic strength and momentum; unfortunately, it's undone by a rather banal ending.",7
7 August 2001,2 movies 2 movies 2 movies in 1,"Cast away is two movies in one,the first half is all about time,the second half is about time has no meaning and Tom Hanks plays both half great. This movie is not for the average movie fan,if you like bombs sex and violence this is not the movie for you,if you love movies for the story and the games his mind plays on him while on the island you will love Cast away,this is also the only movie you will ever see that makes you care about a volleyball and cry when he floats away. all in all a wonderful Hanks movie but not nearly his best. 8 out of 10

27 August 2007,brilliant....a feast of the sneses,"Arguably Tom Hanks's BEST role ever!! He captures Chuck Nolan and puts him on the island PERFECTLY!!!!

Directed by Robert Zemekis, this adventure tells the story of Chuck Nolan, executive director of Fed Ex, as he crash lands on the island and has to fend for hmself against the ravages if nature. But as the coconuts fall ""what is that "" Chuck cries.

And the scenery, MAGNIFICENT!! and what tension, I particularly enjoyed the storming the beaches scene with the guys jumping over the sides of the bats.

Don't miss it!

13 August 2001,Solitude examined,"The film takes an average citizen caught up in the fast paced world and subdues him on a tiny habital island.

The primitive nature of the human comes out as we watch Tom Hanks learn how to survive without the means of comfort.

Two questions arose while I viewed Cast Away.

1. What was his relationship with God?

2. What about sex?

I would have enjoyed these two aspects of our existence analyzed than the ones presented. The film could be anything I suppose pending on the character stranded. Tom Hanks, I feel represented the common suburbanite trapped in the rat race trying to survive, a man who seems to have forgotten about what it means to be alive. I would have rather seen a priest stranded or a prostitute.

The film deals a lot with isolation and the need to have personal contact. I did not care too much for Tom hanks character. He seemed bland but I guess that was the point, or was it?

It was a nice touch with Helen Hunt's recognition of ""no return but can I have a hug and a deep kiss to remind me.""

Then the finale at the crossroads. Was not big on it.

But the film's attempt at showing how we can begin again after a long haul in the rat race succeeds and it would be nice to see if the common man/woman seeking comfort with this world might open his or her eyes to an alternate way of thinking should their soul be dying.

The film looked nice at times. Well photographed.

See ""Swept Away"", an Italian film by Lina Wertmuller. It's stranded people are more interesting to watch.",
3 January 2001,"Good film, pathetic ending.","Cast Away is good, that's true. I knew exactly what it would be all about even before seeing it. But I still had fun. And the plane crash is awesome...freaky to death. The moments spent on the island were purely great, but the rest suffered of the Spielberg-like pathetic ending. Tom Hanks played his usual role, but who cares? He plays it well. Maybe a change wouldn't be so bad...Anyways, his character was pretty intelligent and he reacted just like I would have reacted...except for the swear words...he didn't even say one F-word. And Zemeckis really convinced me that Tom Hanks' Volley ball was his friend...I even felt stupid after the movie because of that. The backgrounds made me feel like I was in paradise. And this film is an exception to his genre, and it's a very good thing; He was always alone on his island, there were no stupid cannibal tribes or anything. It's like Robinson Crusoe, but with its own advantages, and its own weak points. This is surely a good movie, and I'm sure it will get some Academy Award Nominations, because it's exactly the kind of films that will touch the heart of the judges and please to their ""Right to Censorship"" mind. Most of it was a good moment, but the other parts suffered of the pathetic syndrome. And, by the way, this is not a very touching movie, it won't make you cry or anything, but it's very agreeable to watch. And you can also interpret it as a critic to materialism. Good film. 7/10",
25 September 2018,An absolute Masterclass.,"I have watched Cast Away a few times. Story being very simple and straight forward, However, the direction and screenplay takes it to a completely different level. All important aspects is an average human life has been beautifully visualizes. Survival, friendship (Wilson), love, humility, and the importance of basic necessities in life. The music on top of this beauty makes your heart go even softer. This movie is a complete package and a absolute lesson to the new movie directors and a treat for movie lovers and critiques.

12 August 2001,Another solid Hanks film.,"Cast Away is far from being Tom Hanks' best film but still is a very good movie. The best part of this movie by far is Tom Hanks' great performance, his best performance in a movie since Forrest Gump. I believed every moment the way he acted on the island. I don't know how I would act if I was stunk on an island for a period of time, but like Hanks' character I'm sure I would act a little weird. The downside to this movie is the begining and ending. They weren't bad, just not near as good as the middle section. Also I will not give anything away but I was dissapointed the trailor did, which did take some suspense away. Cast Away is still clear proof that Tom Hanks can perform another type of character in the line of many that he has played well. I give Cast Away an 8 out of 10.

18 January 2001,"Riveting, against all odds","PLOT SPOILERS WARNING

You have to give it to the man. Bob Zemeckis, who I consider one of the best directors in Hollywood, lost some of my appreciation after the dreadful ""Contact"" (If even he wasn't able to save that script, maybe it's because it was so bad that nobody could have), but he has proved this year that he is well and truly back on track, first with ""What Lies Beneath"" and now with this virtuoso tour-de-force. To keep the spectator glued to the screen for two hours when all you have is one man and a volleyball in a deserted island is almost defying logic, yet Zemeckis manages to pull it off thanks to excellent timing and rhythm, a phenomenal setting (where is this island? I want to go there!), beautifully photographed, and a fabulous, Oscar-worthy performance from Hanks (again... these two were made for each other), portraying the amazing odyssey of endurance and self-discovery of a man who had lost sight of the important things in life. In fact, I was enjoying it so much that I wasn't sure I wanted the poor guy to escape from the island, I wanted to keep watching his adventures...!

I loved the relationship of Chuck with his alter ego Wilson, which becomes as real a character as you could wish for (in fact, I can think of a couple of action movie stars who could probably take acting tips from it...), and was truly saddened when Chuck is forced to abandon him. The fact that Zemeckis could extract so much sympathy from an inanimate object, a face painted on a ball, reminds me of how menacing Kubrick could make a round, red and yellow light look in ""2001.."", or how much Lucas charmed us with R2-D2's grumpy character, even if we couldn't understand anything he said...

I also loved the fact that, in keeping with his character, Chuck maintained his ""integrity"", what he considered his essence, at least for the first few days, by not opening the boxes. It did bug me a bit that, when the circumstances force him to do so, he left one of them unscathed to serve as a symbol, a reminder of his former self and his mission in life (as the note says, ""This box saved my life""). I thought it was a little bit unrealistic, and I was fearing some terrible but daft final revelation about it (""look! a cellphone!""); but in the end it turns out that what the box contains is not important (""Pulp Fiction"" style), but what it represents, which is not only his mission, but his new future, ""brought in by the tide.."" (If he hadn't saved it, he would never had met his future partner... come on, did anybody really not get the hint of where he was going after the final scene?). Nice final touch.

All in all, a beautiful film and a great performance by Hanks and Zemeckis. They were robbed of a bunch of Oscars, if you ask me.",9

6 October 2014,An Exceptional Film,"What would you do when faced with tragedy? How would you react if you had no human interaction for a year? Would you be able to make it without the amenities that we enjoy every day? Would you go crazy? Would you kill yourself? Cast Away puts you in this situation. We get to peek into a tragedy situation comfortably from home, while Tom Hanks fights for his survival for us.

Our main character, Chuck, is a FedEx manager. He is extremely focused on getting his job done in a timely fashion. His job keeps him very busy due to his trips around the world. The film picks up right before Chuck is about to take another trip. While on the flight, Chuck awakes to turbulence. After a few minutes of struggling the plane crashes into the ocean. Chuck survives by hanging on to a life raft. He eventually loses consciousness and awakes on the shores of a remote island. He quickly finds that there are no other inhabitants of the island and that in order to survive; he is going to be pushed to his limits.

Cast Away explores many themes. Coping with loneliness and isolation is something that is hard to display in film but is shown beautifully throughout this film. The cinematography does an amazing job at getting these themes across. The film features very little dialogue, but you won't even notice it due to the very visually appealing sets. Long shots out towards the ocean and aerial shots of the island get the points across easily. Such a potentially dark premise is given a bit of light with lovable, comic-relief such as Wilson.

It is hard to find a drama that everyone in the family will enjoy equally. Cast Away is no exception. To get the point of the film across darker elements had to enter into the film such as suicide. This isn't the movie that you bring the whole family to, although mature children could handle it and most likely enjoy it. Cast Away receives a 9/10 from me due to the exciting premise and unique way of telling it.",9
27 January 2001,Weak but entertaining nonetheless,"The plot was good but I expected a little more Robinson Crusoe and a little less mental illness. This was an excellent performance by Hanks though-as good as Apollo 13 when there was dialogue but for the amount of the film that was dedicated to watching Hanks in near silence the writing wasn't creative enough to show any depth to the character. You liked the Hanks character mostly because of the first five minutes of the film rather than the bulk of it spent on the island. And I know the escape from the island wasn't the climax of the film but they still showed too much in the trailer.

29 January 2001,Good movie with a bad ending and a little too much Fed-Ex publicity...,"Cast Away is a movie that could have been very boring because of its unoriginal subject, but which is very good. Hanks, playing his usual nice American role which he does so well, gives a good performance, although it probably wasn't hard to do so since this role ressembles a lot of the ones he has had in the last years. The rest of the cast is not very important. The movie starts off well, and the plane crash is simply terrifying and shows how well Zemeckis can direct. The part on the island is very entertaining and you take pleasure watching Hanks learning to live in nature. The idea of making this part an almost silent movie is very good and I loved the concept of Wilson(I won't tell you what it is but I will tell you it is GOOD). What was bad was the fact that this movie has a truly unsatisfying ending, nothing really original to offer and Fed-Ex logos everywhere... But it is still intelligent entertainment.

4 February 2001,The best Fed-Ex commercial I've ever seen.,"What a waste of time. After you're done watching various Fed-Ex trucks and planes go off into the sunset, you're left with Tom Hanks on a deserted island, not able to come up with anything interesting to say or do. After about thirty minutes of island ""action"", the screenwriters completely ran out of ideas and had to resort to the good old ""4 years later"" trick to get poor Tom of his island asap. The rest is more of mainstream Hollywood's gutless and boring storytelling that seems to totally get by without any conflict, twist or confrontation. William Defoe to the rescue!

Cheers, Sascha

15 February 2001,"Excellent, despite a s*it ending","""Cast Away"" goes down as one of those films that's excellent all the way until the end. There are several films that make that cut. I can't think of any off the top of my head but you'll figure it out. Hanks is Chuck Noland, a workaholic FedEx employee who's married to his job, and about to be engaged to Kelly (Helen Hunt). His job has him travel all around the world ensuring better FedEx services by serving as a hustling efficiency expert who shapes the offices. In one ill fated night, however, after proposing to Kelly, Chuck's plane over the Pacific goes down in a fiery storm and he's washed away to a deserted island. For the next two hours, Hanks finds himself surviving off his natural instincts and his smarts as he begins to salvage what he can in his life. The story is remarkably smooth that fleshes out Hanks' character as a decent man who's good at heart. It's a chronicle of his life as he lives day by day on the island and it's actually fascinating to watch how he lives. Whether it be discovering how to start a fire to gathering food, we watch Noland do it all. However, and there won't be many people that will disagree, the ending really sucks. It's on a so/so basis where you have absolutely no idea what happens to his character. I think part of the reason why the ending isn't good is because audiences want to see Hanks' character live the rest of his life and his re-adjustment to society, something you don't get to see much of. All in all though, Cast Away is a great film to watch.",
5 February 2005,See this movie!,"Cast Away is Tom Hanks in his best role since Forrest Gump. It's the story of a FedEx man who gets stranded on a desert island after his plane crashes. Since the plot isn't all that eventful, I'd been expecting to be bored watching Tom Hanks talk to himself on an island for a long time.

I couldn't have been more wrong. Cast Away is brilliantly acted and is even amazingly funny at certain moments. It's also the only movie I know of that has ever made me feel sorry for an inanimate object. And at times, I felt myself following the same thought processes as Tom Hanks' character, thinking I'd do things the same way he did in that situation.

Tom Hanks gives an Oscar-worthy, memorable performance. My advice to everyone is simple: go see this movie!

30 January 2021,Tom treasure Hanks.,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",10
5 May 2019,Still a masterpiece but funny,"Sunday Family day, so yeah thanks HBO hits. Probably my 5th rewatch of this film (story below!). When I was young, I considered Cast Away as the greatest of the greatests (I would've given this 5 star if Letterboxd existed 19 years ago) of Robert Zemeckis. Present day, I just realized that some parts of it were really bad, and there were good parts too. If I cried to this film before, now I'm just laughing- it's definitely a Survivor show but sort of comedy. BUT THIS IS NOT AN AWFUL MOVIE. Not at all. Others might see it as boring and tedious but as far as I am concerned, it is still entertaining as ever and with hardly a set, hardly a supporting cast, a minimum of dialogue and expressions, but with a hurricane of emotions, a credible and breathtaking Hanks still keeps me (and the audience) at the edge of their seats from the beginning till the end, in this masterpiece of a movie. Yes, even though I laughed at it sometimes, it's still a masterpiece.

As for the story (this was never important anyway)... I've first seen then when I was 4th grade, also in fifth grade for a class film viewing, in high school and in college, and the most memorable of all was summer of 2001. We had a DVD of copy of this and my sister invited his boyfriend (now his husband) to watch it at home. My sister and I pretty much connived because I also got to invite my crush who happens to be my neighbor- all four of us watched it together. Bad decision. After we finished the film, I blurted out- ""so he didn't have sex for four years???, my crush replied, ""he was a true survivor then"".....

and I never saw his face again.",8
12 December 2021,wonderful movie,"The film is very beautiful and I received the feelings of the character in an excellent way, and all this is due to the representation of the legendary Tom Hanks, and I liked the way the character's feelings conflicted while he was on the island and how he suffered a lot in it. The film is very emotional and touching, and it deserves to be watched strongly.

23 December 2000,The Shortest 2+ Hour Movie Ever?,"At first glance, a shipwrecked Tom Hanks growing a beard didn't sound very appealing to me. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised at the end of the movie. Tom Hanks is terrific in this role, as his depression and descent to near madness as he loses hope of escape is very empathic. Interestingly enough, however, I found the time on the island, although the core of the movie, to be very short for what is supposed to be 4 years time. This is a small complaint, however, and Tom Hanks' triumph of human spirit will make anyone's day.

1 January 2001,good movie which could be much better,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",10
26 December 2000,Biggest Waste of Celluloid EVER,"Did Fed Ex make this movie? What was the Big emergency that Mr. Hanks had to run down to S. America to on Christmas Day? A big sorting emergency? A disgruntled Brazilian worker? Give me a break. And what a waste of a year of losing weight. I hereby nominated the cheesiest time passing shot to the speared fish and the waifish Hanks standing on the rock like a supermodel behind it. And then when he finds the Porta Potty in the rocks, why is he suddenly a cave man. And don't even get me started on the anti thespian Helen Hunt. Wilson was more believable as a human being. Can I please have my $9.00 back. The high point of the movie was the plane crash, it's just unfortunate that they didn't all die.

6 June 2002,I Loved this movie to death!,"Cast Away was the best movie of 2000 and deserved a lot more than what some people gave it. Tom Hanks went through so much trouble losing and gaining weight at times during the filming.

Fed-Ex supervisor Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) has just returned from a business trip in Russia just so he can spend Christmas with his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt). After the celebration, Chuck finds out he has to go back to Russia to close a deal. When he agrees, he boards a plane not knowing that it ends up crashing at sea with him still inside. He hops in an emergency raft and awakes the next morning to find out that he is ona deserted island. He hopes every second that he will be rescued soon, well it turns out that he spends 4 years on the island all by himself. After 4 years of nothing but bordom, Chuck decides to leave the island and head out to sea hoping he will be found. Later, he is found by a supply ship and is taken back to America. What's weird is that when he returns, everything has changed and he feels even more isolated than when he was one island.

Robert Zemeckis did such a brilliant job directing this movie and he should've gotten a best director Oscar for his work on the film. Cast Away was the best film I saw of the first year of the century.",9
7 March 2006,Another example of the excellence and diversity of Tom Hanks acting ability.,"This is a movie definitely worth seeing, and for myself, watching about once a year. I have enjoyed Tom Hanks in a number of movies, this one being near the top of his list. The scenery is spectacular in a confined environment. His struggle and his evolution to primitive being shows the determination to live, where many would simply lay down and die, wallowing in their own self-pity for being stranded seemingly without hope. And his recovery from devastation when he realizes he has lost the love of his life for the second time, shows a similarity to the persona he had to bring out, simply to survive the adverse conditions in which he found himself when he crawled out of the ocean. An absolutely excellent film.

21 November 2015,I'm sorry.....i'm not a Tom Hanks fan.,"There are some Hollywood actors who engender sympathy to the public,

but (since my point of view) don't play a character but themselves.

When i see ""Saving Private Ryan"" i don't see ""Captain Miller"" i'm still seeing Tom Hanks. In ""The Terminal"" i don't see Viktor Navorski i see Tom Hanks.

Of course, for Hollywood this is an ace up its sleeve since a lot of people go to the movies because of the actors who play in it.

Having said that, The movie is OK and well made, but it would have been more credible with a different actor. Anyway not the best of Zemeckis who is a great director.

29 January 2016,Superb,"I can't say much about this stunning movie that others haven't said before me but I did want to remark on a few memorable things. The deeply portrayed emotion between Helen Hunt and Tom Hanks - utterly sensitive and spellbinding. The plane crash scene, probably the greatest cinematography and special effects of such a scene in all of cinema. Makes the shaky-cam effects of TV's Mayday look like rank amateurs. Also Alan Silvestri's magical, haunting score. Without that score it would have been a loss for the movie equally as great as when Chuck loses his one true love. Sometimes you are so blown away by a movie that you can't even get up to leave the theatre and just here the composer treats us to his masterful work. It washes over us like the waves on the island. Beautiful.

6 April 2001,Some very good acting,"This is one of the most unusual and enjoyable movies I've seen in a while. For almost 95% of the movie there's only one actor, two if you want to count a volleyballand in a way he/it does become a very significant character. Why did I enjoy this movie so much? Tom Hanks. Need I say more? Ok, maybe Wilson the volleyball. He was pretty good too; strong silent type. Actor of few words.

Tom Hanks plays a FedEx executive sent to Russia to setup the first courier operation the country has ever seen. His life revolves around the clock and following very specific rules. There is no such thing as basically being on time. You're on time or you're notand you better be on time. He comes back from this trip and we're briefly introduced to his personal life. We meet his fiancé (played by Helen Hunt) and get a very brief glimpse of the life he leads away from FedEx. Shortly after his arrival to the US, he is called away again on another trip. After a hasty good-bye, he's on the plane to his next destination. We all know what happens next and basically for the rest of the movie so I'm not going to go into any more detail about the story. Making a movie with primarily one character in it is kind of a risky venture but this movie proved that it can be done. Tom Hanks is proving why he's one of the best actors in the business with this movie. It's amazing the amount of stress he puts on himself with the physical changes he goes through to make this movie look authentic. There isn't a lot of dialogue either. Hanks has been able to marvelously show the transformation a person goes through when isolated from the rest of society for a long period of time. There are many moments in the movie where Hanks doesn't say a word but is able to communicate so much to the audience. My favorite is when he's sitting on his haunches looking at the remains of a port-a-potty that washed up thinking of how to best use it. It's a very simple scene yet Hanks is able to say so much without ever uttering a word.

The few weaknesses that I did see revolved around the ending. I guess with a movie of this nature, there are only so many ways to tie it up. Either the character remains stranded on the island forever or he gets rescued. They chose the latter for this movie but to me, it seemed anti-climatic. The ending was tied up a bit neatly but they did try to incorporate a bit of a human interest into it by having a problem arise between Hanks character and Hunts character. It's not overly interesting and I won't spoil it for you but trust me when I say that you will be amazed by the portion of the movie that revolves around Hanks time on the island.

Overall, I'd say this movie is definitely worth seeing on the big screenand it should be seen on a big screen. There are too many quiet, subtle instances that you will miss if you watch it on a TV. It's worth the price of full admission.",9

25 February 2001,Hanks and Zemeckis - a winning team!,"Tom Hanks is Chuck Nolan. He´s a FedEx-manager and travels around the world. His clock and his filofax are the most important things in his life - besides his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt). But one day the world changes as Chuck´s aeroplane crashes down on the ocean. He´s stranding on a lonely island. And it´s not ""Gilligan´s island""...

This is year 7 after ""Forrest Gump"". I guess it was damned hard to top it. But Hanks and Zemeckis did it again! Hanks gives a breath- taking one-man show. I think it´s good that he comes more and more away from his image as a comedian by playing dramatic roles. He touched me deeply - especially in the scenes when he is talking to Wilson, the volleyball. If he won´t win the Oscar, I can´t help it! Also Helen Hunt gave a very strong performance - though she had only a few scenes.

But it also gave me something to think over. Maybe that sounds a little banal now, but we should be thankful for the simple things in life - like having something to eat and drink, good friends etc. - things that we don´t really care about, because we´re too ignorant sometimes! Think about it! After watching this film you will see the world with different eyes!",10
16 August 2011,Hanks and Wilson Can Do No Wrong,"Baseball. Cool Ranch Doritos. Tom Hanks. What is more American than these three things? That's what I thought. Nothing.

Tom Hanks will forever be America's funny, charming Uncle. He's a guy you want to be like, makes you feel better when you see him, and most importantly, you are sure he would like you too. He's the kind of guy who could be stuck on an island with only an ugly sweater and a volleyball, and you'd still want to watch him do his thing. And if you've had dreams like this, I know I have, you're in luck, because there's an entire movie with this exact premise; Cast Away.

Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a hard-working, oft traveling FedEx honcho. He's well liked and respected, and all signs point to Chuck having found the woman for him in Kelly Frears (Hunt).

It seemed like just another routine flight aboard a FedEx plane, to which a smiling Chuck says to Kelly, ""I'll be right back."" The rest as they say... is history.

It as at this point that we get to see the true talents of Tom Hanks really take flight (no pun intended). After a truly amazing plane crash sequence, this becomes Tom's movie.

Hanks literally transformed himself for this role, gaining and then losing 50+ lbs, and growing his hair and beard so long it that surely made ZZ Top question their own follicle abilities. After years on the island, the result is a rugged, fish catching, shelter making, fire starting, tiny shorts wearing survivalist who would no doubt make Bear Grylls proud.

Hanks is nothing short of mesmerizing on screen. As one of the most recognizable people in the world, it's not easy for an actor of his stature to completely fool the audience in thinking it's somebody else on that big screen, but Mr. Hanks rises to the challenge again. This is not Tom Hanks, this is Chuck Noland; A man thrown into a situation few will ever experience. And in becoming Chuck, Hanks has shared with us one of the greatest performances the cinema has ever seen.

I will not go into the specifics of what takes place on that island. That is for your eyes only.

This is simply a great performance in a phenomenal film.

Go watch Cast Away.

Thank me later.",10
24 June 2001,Average,"Adequate acting and direction, but the screenplay falls flat once Hanks gets off the island. Many similiar comments have been made before (should have dealt with the isolation...), but the ending...S***! It plays more like a bad episode of Gilligans Island.

4 March 2001,"Hanks is great throughout, the last fifteen minutes are a letdown however.","A very impressive performance by Hanks. It really is quite an achievement to carry an entire movie singlehandedly. Absolutely no interplay, mere glances and expressions. Also it was fascinating to see how engaging the island-scenes were even though they were terribly low-concept (Hanks trying to crack open a couple of coconuts, Hanks opening a bunch of boxes that washed ashore, Hanks catching some fish). The direction was very good indeed. I was let down however, by the last 15 minutes. The story was completely aimless and empty, and i also found it very frustrating to see how the idea of 'hope for the future' was being enforced upon us. The crash-sequence deserves special mention, as it had me on the edge of my chair (what a terrible cliche). The level of realism was astounding.

18 January 2001,An excellent piece of work,"It was really intriguing to see how this film can succeed using such a basic principle. A large part of the film is carried solehandedly by Hanks, whereas there is no dialogue to speak of, no dramatic tension in the traditional sense, no score to accompany the imagery. Yet Cast Away keeps us completely involved. I'm not exactly his greatest fan, but i think Hanks is to be commended. He really deserved the critical acclaim for this role. I think it is terrific to see such great names (Hanks & Zemeckis) taking these great risks in filmmaking. (Unfortunately) I rarely see this kind of experimental filmmaking in mainstream hollywood. The film's ending leaving us a bit puzzled, perhaps the story could have been resolved in a better way and i never cared much for Helen Hunt, however all in all this is still a great piece of work. The plane-crash sequence deserves special mention, as it is truly spectacular as well as frighteningly real.

25 February 2016,A pure masterpiece!,"How did Tom Hanks do it?

First of all, I wanted to say that the emotional quality of this film was impeccable.

Chuck Noland is played brilliantly by Tom Hanks, to be honest I believe he brought unmatchable emotion to this film.

Well, Wilson is a volleyball who is a great addition to the film. You must be thinking how is a volleyball a important part of a film? I will tell you this now, you have to watch the film to feel what the volleyball brings...

Obviously the graphical quality might not be up to the flabbergasting quality it is at today, as the film was made in 2000, though it is fine and shouldn't be discarded for its age.

For a film shot a number of years back it still could get a high scoring box office taking. Of course Tom Hanks is a great actor and has starred in numerous films; but being able to talk to a volleyball and mean so much pure emotion is a wow factor for this film.

I would definitely recommend this film to anybody who is an adventure movie fan.

What a masterpiece of a film!",10
30 December 2001,Movie or very long FedEX Commercial?,"A new twist on an old theme stretched to an agonizing two-and-a-half hours. If I had never viewed foreign films that combine intellect, humour grace and spectacular scenery, I might think that Cast Away is a stellar performance.

Sadly, it comes off as the usual white-bread Hollywood mediocrity. It excels at nothing except hype.

If you like movies of men who are stranded on an island, look for the Italian film ""Mediterraneo"" -- warm, funny and you won't even have to look at the FedEX logo a thousand times.

29 December 2000,Untimely ending,"Movies like Cast Away which center on someone trapped in a hostile environment are all about timing. There must be adequate time for us to get to know the character before he embarks on his adventure, but not too much time or we feel the director is delaying the inevitable. The time the character spends in isolation must be just right: Too little and we don't feel the depth of despair the character feel; too long and we get antsy. And the resolution must also be timed perfectly: If it happens too quickly it seems too easy; too long and we begin to feel exhausted along with the main character.

Director Zemeckis times ""Cast Away"" perfectly. Throw in an amazing plane crash scene and an Oscar worthy performance by Tom Hanks, and you have a good film. Good, but not great. Zemeckis sets Hanks up as a time-obsessed Fed Ex executive. We want to see Hanks obsession with time change, but we don't get a clear payoff that it does. The movie ends on an ambiguous note, leading us to question which way Hanks will literally head. It's a question best resolved, but it isn't here.

6 January 2001,such wonders,"In many ways, Cast Away reminds me very much of another very good Robert Zemeckis film, Contact. Both of them had endings that were somewhat disappointing (as one person I heard said it about Contact ""I waited three hours to see the aliens and they're her freaking father?""). Cast Away's ultimate conclusion was even more ambiguous and troubling, but that does not keep it from being an enthralling and interesting film and one of the ten best movies of the year, just as Contact was enthralling and interesting and one of the ten best movies of its year.

In short, Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a gung-ho Fedex supervisor/trouble shooter/slave driver who travels the world licking troubled Fedex centers into shape. He loves Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), a Ph.D student close to finishing her dissertation. On Christmas Eve, and on the eve he was to propose marriage, he is sent on a flight to Asia. The plane goes off course and then down in an incredibly gripping sequence. Noland (No-land - even his name has meaning in this film) is the only survivor and he washes ashore onto an isolated rock in the middle of the Pacific with nothing to survive with. He salvages his raft (the survival kit and flares went down with the plane), and some Fedex packages that wash ashore, and sets up camp.

The bulk of the film is made up of Hank's attempts to survive on the island, primarily in two episodes - how he acclimatizes and learns to survive, and then four years later, when he at last has a chance to get off the island. The script is really remarkably well done, considering that Hanks has no one to speak to for the bulk of the film (although he does create a 'friend' out of a volleyball with whom he converses). The Fedex packages that wash ashore at first seem worse than useless, but their uses are very clever and hidden. Noland does all of the things you think of doing yourself, often at the same time you are reaching the same conclusions, although I have to say he's many times more resourceful than I - I would have died on that island. The drama of surviving, and Hanks' abilities as an actor to keep everything human, are engrossing. Noland's island is a forbidding spit of sand and rock way out somewhere, and there is no man Friday to help this Robinson Crusoe. Every problem he has, from making fire to dealing with a rotting tooth with no anesthetic and no tools, are dealt with in a straightforward and realistic fashion.

Zemeckis's direction is outstanding. The crash scene is tense, frightening and incredibly well done (so well done it deserves mention more than once). Zemeckis (and his cinematographer) strand Hanks on an island that they show is both amazingly beautiful and also barren and desolate. Hanks' buddy, Wilson the volleyball, is handled so well by the director (and the script) that Hanks' constant banter with it makes you begin to understand how he relies on the volleyball to keep his sanity while at the same time imparting the feeling that the ball really is talking back somehow.

Noland's escape from the island is also very well done, and this should be no spoiler to anyone who has seen a commercial for the film that gives this part away. The bittersweet reunification with Hunt's Frears is effective, and Hanks has a wonderful speech at the close of the film that encapsulates the film's theme, about the powerlessness and hopelessness we sometimes feel in life and the importance of tides. Then it maybe goes on a little too long, and leaves with a totally ambiguous and unfulfilling ending. Oh well. I'll only have to watch this one nine more times before I'm sick of it. Nine out of ten. Laughing Lion says go check it out.",9
23 August 2001,Little Wilson steals the show.,"This comment amongst so many others only has one thing to say. Wilson is one of the greatest characters in a movie I have ever seen. Tom Hanks you were in fine form as usual, but Wilson stole the show for me. Excellent movie.

14 April 2020,"WILSON, I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!!!","PROS:The film captures successfully the triumph of human spirit under difficult conditions. Tom Hanks gives an outstanding and dedicated performance as a man cut off from civilization and through his character's eyes are developed the themes of loneliness, loss and isolation. The little dialogue and the nonexistence of music, when the character is on the island, amplify this isolation. Robert Zemeckis manages to make a volleyball one of the most compelling characters of the film and symbolises the hope throught it. Also, it's worth mentioning that the way that he shoots the plane crash is very impressive. The relationship between Hanks and Hunt's characters is developed nicely so their reunion is emotional. CONS:The movie could me trimmed down some minutes without loosing its charm. In addition, the connection of the first and the last minutes is a little off-putting and the symbolism that displays could be presented differently.

29 October 2002,A Creative Ending is Cast Away,"Tom Hanks talks to a volleyball on a deserted tropical island. He remembers his boy scout skills to start a fire. He developes a taste for raw fish, and becomes quite a tailor, seamstress and boat maker. It sounds like outlandish stuff, but Hanks makes it work for me, at least while he is on that island. The movie loses steam, and some creative writing once he gets back to the mainland. It is almost like one person wrote the screenplay on the island, and someone else wrote the screenplay when he is rescued. I followed the plot while he was on the island all alone. I expectantly hoped as he found ways to cope, survive and win against all odds. Back home again, people seemed harsher than the sea and its creatures. The final scene, in particular was really disappointing and a cop-out. As I viewed the final scene, I thought, ""They get the Hanks character all the way to this junction, and this is all they could think of?"" It was a uncreative finish to a imaginative movie.

9 July 2001,This movie should be cast away.,"I was warmly looking forward to this movie since I love the ocean and I generally enjoy Tom Hanks movies (such as Forrest Gump and Sleepless in Seattle). Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in Cast Away.

The movie opened with a variety of global snippets creating a sense of speed and excitement. After a while (and a few borrowed scenes from airplane disaster movies of the 70s), we found Hanks in a predictable marooned situation on a tropical isle doing all of the things we would expect: finding water, food, shelter. The plot drearily and ploddingly followed each step of the way.

The only freshness and creativity was the introduction of the new star, Wilson. I admittedly cried when Dumbo's mother was locked up in the Disney movie, ""Dumbo,"" but I just couldn't get into this ""Wilson"" thing in Cast Away; I was dry-eyed the whole way through. Call me crass, call me hard-hearted, but I never cried for poor, enigmatic Wilson.

Perhaps my greatest disappointment was the movie virtually ignoring a gut-wrenching issue throughout 95% of the film. Sure, Hanks was lonely on a deserted island, but what about his love interest, Helen Hunt? She faced a very difficult issue: give Chuck Noland (Hanks) up for dead and start a new life or cling to the chance that he might still be alive? Watching a great actress like Hunt grapple with this tough decision fraught with emotional drama and trauma would have been much more interesting than watching Hanks fishing and losing weight. And what is more relevant to most of us - getting cast on a deserted isle or having a loved one disappear - kidnapped, killed, a runaway? The questions facing Hunt were, by far, the most relevant and engaging ones to be touched and indulged by the film.

Alas, it was not to be. Helen Hunt's role was almost a cameo in comparison to Hanks. And for the little time she had, she should be given the Charlie McCarthy award for the wooden delivery of her lines.

Strangely (and sadly), Wilson was the best supporting actor in this movie. I give Cast Away a 4 - only for the upcoming star, Wilson, and for the island and ocean surf which actually were quite lovely.

(By the way, the symbolism of the ""crossroads"" was lame, too.)",4

20 July 2001,Good adventure,"""Cast Away"" is a good adventure film but had a pretty predictable plot line. The plot line was the only disappointment that I got from the film. The presentation of the story was good and it had its comical moments. I also liked that it showed the difficulties of going from civilization to a cave man existence.

Over all, good film (7 out of 10).

15 May 2001,excellent FedEx PR campaign,"From the very beginning until the very end, key message of movie remains the same: FedEx will do anything to deliver your package. It is a pity that Robert Zemekis and Tom Hanks (ok, I admit he acts great) had let themselves to be misused by such incredibly clear adversting. Why they didnt create fictional company? Because the real one has paid a lot cash for not doing that. But with me, I dont want to pay for going to the movies to watch something like that. Sorry, no more!

31 December 2000,An involving story of survival.,"For FedEx manager Chuck Noland, played by Tom Hanks, time is everything. It's the unforgiving taskmaster that enforces order in his life, and adhering to that order, making sure packages get where they have to be when they have to be there, gives Chuck a sense of control -- a false sense, it turns out. It's not until his FedEx plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific, stranding him alone on a deserted island, that Chuck is forced to confront the difficult truth that we all are merely at the mercy of the ebb and flow of fate.

This involving examination of how a modern man, stripped of his pager and cell phone, might react if left to survive on his own in the wild comprises the premise of ""Cast Away"".

Being alone on screen for nearly an entire film would be an immense challenge for any actor, but Hanks proves he's more than up to the task. The actor also deserves extra kudos for his dedication. Production on the movie halted for a year while Hanks shed 55 pounds and grew a long beard for the movie's second half which takes place four years after he was originally stranded. Guys with two Academy Awards who make $25 million a picture don't have to do that sort of thing. Helen Hunt is also very good as the girlfriend Chuck leaves behind.

As bleak as Cast Away can be in its darker moments, the film does leave us with an uplifting message -- it's the philosophy that ultimately motivates Chuck to survive: One tide of fate may land you on a deserted island, but the next tide might just deliver you home.",
20 January 2001,Very good movie!!,"Before I saw this...all of my friends were telling me how great that it was. I had nothing to do so I decided to see it...I mean Tom Hanks has never been in a bad movie, and Robert Zemekis is a good director. I was not disapointed. I think that this is one of the best movies of the year. The movie starts out good and keeps getting better till the end. Some people said that the movie was too long, but I disagree. I think that it was the perfect length; any longer would have been boring, and any shorter and there would have been something left out. Also, some people didn't like the ending, but I thought that it fit perfectly at what Chuck (Tom) said earlier in the film. I really recomend that everyone sees this. It a really good movie that I think everyone will enjoy. After this I am going to get a volleyball and name it Wilson. hehehe just kidding. 10/10!!!

25 January 2001,Survivor movie,"Cast Away is, in fact, a good movie. A man all alone in an island trying to survive, there are quite few movies about that.

The movie is slow, even when Hanks' character isn't on the island, and that's a real problem if there is almost no dialogue in most of the movie. But Tom Hanks did it very well, specially his ""insane"" dialogue with Wilson.

I think Cast Away is the perfect movie to watch on a DVD, but too slow to be seen in the big screen.

16 June 2011,"Review of ""Cast Away""","Robert Zemeckis' ""Cast Away"" is a movie that is not only a revolutionary piece of film, but it is as poignant and affecting as they come. One of the most interesting and, often, unsung aspects of ""Cast Away"" is that Zemeckis and his crew basically crafted this movie on the fly and during production. In fact, the whole concept of ""Wils...on The Volleyball"" was not conceived until about halfway through shooting. Another interesting aspect of the film is that a very large portion of it has no dialogue, yet it still remains highly entertaining experience. Much of the film's complexity comes from the incredibly moving performance as Chuck Noland, a FedEx engineer who is tragically separated from everything he loves. Which leads me to another point, and, possibly, my favorite aspects of ""Cast Away"" - the themes conveyed. The movie is deeply driven by the central idea that life can be cruel and unforgiving thing, but that shouldn't stop us from pursuing something better. This theme is accentuated to an enormous degree by the movies soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. Though the soundtrack is absent throughout most of the first half of this movie, the movie's main theme is slowly introduced towards the end of the film. It's a very solemn musical piece that effectively illustrates the pain the Chuck Noland experiences throughout the movie, but it also presents a sort of hopeful tone to the film. In the end, I feel that ""Cast Away"" presents a number of innovative and impressive techniques that, ultimately, make it a perfect film.",10
28 December 2000,"Great acting, dopey script","Cast Away is sure to nab another Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks, and in a relatively weak year for film he may just win his third. He would deserve it, and not just for his physical transformation. Any other actor in the world would get laughs if they recited the dopey dialogue (or monologue, I guess, since he's alone on that island). I can't imagine Ralph Finnes being taken seriously if he proclaimed ""I have made . . .fire!"" but Hanks somehow pulls it off.

You may be aware that the studio moronically gives away the ending in the trailers and commercials--it is inexcusable and blunts much of the emotion of the situation. This is a solid film with a fascinating second and third acts, but a flat-footed fourth act. They paint themselves into a corner with no satisfactory ending, and then fail to come up with a satisfactory conclusion. But with Hanks' acting and Zemeckis' eye-popping direction, this film is very satisfying.

26 December 2000,Tom Hanks is brilliant,"Cast Away: ***1/2

""Cast Away"" is very close to brilliance. Tom Hanks is an excellent actor and he gets to prove that in this movie. Also, there is some beautiful scenery.

The movie is about Tom Hanks' character, who is a Fed Ex man, getting lost on a deserted island. He is on a Fed Ex plane and it goes down. Some of the mail washed up on shore. A volley ball named Wilson befriends him. It was very neat seeing how he did things. He made shoes and fire and other stuff that you need to see the movie for. I would go crazy on the island. He occasionally does, but maintains sanity for the most part. Before he left to get on the plane he had a girlfriend whom he loved. She is played by Helen Hunt. She isn't in the movie much which is sort of a disapointment.

Tom Hanks is brilliant. He is a great actor who has a lot of talent. He makes the movie work. Showing off his acting skills and making it look easy. This must have been a difficult film to make. But through all that his talent keeps going on.

The reason I did not award it four stars is the ending. It was vague. All dramas end that way, but this was unclear. There were so many possibilities. Oh, well.

The island that the movie was based on was beautiful. Throughout the movie it is a feast for the eyes. Great scenery.

In closing, the movie is all around brilliant. Just try and ignore the ending.",8
19 August 2021,Cast Away (2000) Review:,"Now this is a film that is chore to sit through.

I may be being biased here, but Hollywood once again just has to make film's that drag out way to long,

and don't say much of anything we haven't heard before.

Anyway, if you haven't seen it, watch it at least once, cause either you'll like it, or you'll want to get off the island to.

30 May 2006,Another good Hanks movie,"Tom Hanks is an interesting actor. Or rather, the reactions he provokes are interesting. There are those who love him and those who scratch their heads wondering why he has achieved such extraordinary success in his career. He is after all quite 'ordinary.' He is not a great actor, though not a particularly bad one. His main claim to fame seems to be his unfailing ability to generate sympathy from the audience for the characters he plays. You always 'like' Hanks in his film roles. Varied as they are, that's quite an achievement. And it is based on that very ordinariness that many of us seem to find perplexing.

Cast Away is a very good example of this. Hanks has to hold the attention of the audience for the bulk of the film, as he is the only human character on screen. The vast, inescapable power of the ocean and the primitive beauty of the island vie with him for that attention, but come off worst. He is certainly not the only actor who could pull this off, but it is still a neat trick and there were certainly many who felt in the run-up to the launch of the film that this would be the one that finally found him out as a rather average talent. It does no such thing.

He slowly draws you into the predicament of his character and persuades you to suspend the cynicism that might make you question a number of the events in the plot. And, true to form, he has you firmly on his side at all the most critical moments. The direction and photography both help to sustain the illusion of what you are seeing, and the plot - though faintly ridiculous - has enough meat in it to allow the drama to play out.

Though the period of isolation on the island is the main body of this film, one of the more interesting aspects for me was the way the character inter-acted with the real world. Without giving anything away, there is a deeply emotional thread to this story about an intense personal relationship that is destroyed by cruel events and this, I found to my surprise, provided some of the most impressive scenes towards the end of the film.

Rating Cast Away was for me a decision between 7 and 8. I went for 8 in the end, perhaps generously, because it is basically a feel-good movie which works. You should not watch it expecting much more than that. Few deep human questions are asked here, and when reviewing the plot after the film has finished you conclude that - even as it held your attention at the time - it was in fact quite formulaic.

Nevertheless it is, as I said, another classic Tom Hanks movie. And these have become almost a genre in themselves. If you like The Terminal, The Ladykillers, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, you'll enjoy this film too - essentially for the same reason: the star himself.",8

23 October 2001,Absolutely fantastic!,"Tom Hanks plays a man who works for Fed-Ex, and he is always concerned about the time. He says that the time is his worst enemy, but he will soon think otherwise. On a business trip his plane crashes somewhere over the Atlantic, and he is washed ashore a remote island. He tries to think over the situation and decides to attempt on leaving the island. But soon he realize that he will spend a long time here. And back home is girlfriend is waiting for him to come home, like he promised he would.

I just have to say that this movie was fantastic! It´s totally different from anything else I´ve ever seen. And Tom Hanks is, as always, awesome. After a rather slow first half hour, things gets interesting as we see Hanks arrive at the island. There are no dialogue whatsoever for long periods, which feels nice. It wouldn´t as interesting as it is, if Hanks crashed along with a friend, or something. Now he´s completely on his own, and it´s very enjoyable to watch Hanks trying to survive.

The director, Robert Zemeckis, has found the exactly right tone, and the movie never gets boring, well at least not on the island. ""Cast Away"" is beautifully shot, with majestic environments and all. The film´s score is superb, it touches the heart exactly in the right moments.

As I mentioned above, Hanks is great. He is one of my favorite actors, and I must say that his performance is one of the best he has ever made. Helen Hunt has a rather small part, but she does a fine job with it.

And in the end, even I had problems with keeping the tears away. ""Cast Away"" is THAT good. If you enjoy the tv-show ""Survivor"" but want something a bit deeper, this is perfect. Great movie!

Minuses: Long, boring, tedious and uninteresting script. Bizarre half-hour of celluloid sacrificed to god/totem/symbol/athletic device ""Wilson"". Did anyone else notice that they actually used VIOLINS when it finally and thankfully drifted away (during another excruciating five minutes of slo-mo cinema). Did anyone else notice that Helen Hunt somehow got from her house to a detached garage without getting wet? Or that Hanks simply did not drink enough liquid to come close to surviving his first 24 hours? Or that he managed to drift 100 feet from a supercargo ship in the middle of the Pacific?

Oh, this is a truly dreadful movie. Read Robinson Crusoe instead.

24 February 2001,A good movie but...,"I agree with many of the other comments that the product placement in the movie was a little hard to take and detracted from the movie. In many ways they hurt the film's artistic integrity and credibility as a serious drama. How can you take the film seriously when it so blatantly resembles a FedEx propaganda film. Were these real Hollywood writers who wrote this movie? Is anyone totally certain that the writers weren't actually marketing executives from Federal Express? My belief is that the writer was a real Hollywood writer who happens to hold real shares of Federal Express.

To sum it up, Cast Away, a good movie with good acting and a good story, is nearly ruined by the fact that it plays like a long commercial for Federal Express. After about two hours of having the FedEx logo pounded into your head, you just get fed up.

10 January 2001,A good film. Worth the journey,"I like Tom Hanks, I like him in this film. I usually enjoy Zemeckis films, I enjoyed this film a lot.

The best part is indeed the ""stranded on an island part"". Hanks is no superman, just a reasonably intelligent guy who got lucky. Lucky to survive a ""landing on water"" (which for big jets is usually fatal) and lucky to be washed across the reef and onto an island. Lucky also to be able to survive significant puncture wounds that would kill most people through infection. You have to have a strong constitution to survive daily contact with a coral reef. It looks so peaceful and beautiful, but it is very dangerous (the book ""Castaway"" by Lucy Irvine is a good read and may well have been an inspiration to Hanks and company).

The boat escape from the island was pure drama, getting over the big wave was such a thrill.

Remainder of the film was not that interesting but I thought the ending was effective.

I gave it a 9 out of 10 stars and I would be glad to see it again.",9
26 December 2000,The ratings speak for themselves. Go see this one while it's in the theaters.,"Cinematography is beautiful. Special effects are stunning. Tom Hanks' acting is on par with Forrest Gump. Plot is fascinating. Under 12 may find parts of it boring, but it is a perfect ""what if"" scenario for those of us who have ever wished we were alone on a deserted island.

This is a MUST SEE.

24 December 2000,Worthwhile Mix of Primal Nature and Hollywood,"Well...hours later and I still haven't come to a conclusion about ""Cast Away"". Though a lengthy movie, it drags only in the last scenes, uncertain about whether a ""happily ever after"" or a more ambiguous ending would be more suitable. In the end, the makers split the difference, not completely satisfactorily.

However, let's deal with the stuff on the island and leave the Hollywood bits (and the incredible FedEx product placement) aside. I was enthralled by the isolation and Tom Hanks' performance and wished that there was more of it. Lots of small revelations, very worthwhile. Overall, I'd certainly recommend the movie, but a couple of points shy of the ""10"" the makers were shooting for.

Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is in no way prepared for the task of surviving out in the wild. Chuck realizes that it doesn't really matter how prepared he is, because he is now in a situation where he either learns quick, or he dies.

He will stop at nothing to get home to her, and for her company that he so desperately desires. His loneliness almost leads to his insanity (which Hanks manages to make very comical actually).

I really believe that Tom Hanks is one of only a very few actors in the world who could have pulled this role off so brilliantly. For about 98% of the movie, Hanks is the only actor on screen, but it wouldn't really matter if there were other actors present anyway. Hank's performance is so great that all the viewer's focus would be on him regardless.

Cast Away is a movie about a man trying to live, and dealing with the loneliness of living on an island by himself. Tom Hanks at the top of his game. 8/10",8
11 January 2002,A pretty good movie.,"This movie was pretty good. I actually found the time Hanks was on the island alone to be the most interesting. I found myself getting transformed to the island. Hanks is one of the few actors that could keep you interested with very little dialogue.

The movie really lost my interest when Hanks is rescued. From then on, the movie relies on standard cliches. I didn't care for the way the movie ended, but I wasn't as interested in the movie by the time it ended.

It's not Hanks' best work, but it was still a good movie. I was disappointed that Wilson didn't even get a nomination as Best Supporting Athletic Sports Equipment!

I give the movie a 6 out of 10 stars.

3 August 2005,I'm not one to give out a ten; however . . .,"""The Oscar goes to . . . Russell Crowe."" Honestly the only man that could have beaten Hanks, or at least could have contended with him (no pun intended) did. ""Gladiator"" was amazing, as was Crowe, but come on. How much dialogue did Hanks have? And yet three hours felt no more than a breezy and tight hour and a half movie. Simply amazing.

Hanks was just plain fat to start this movie and admits it was done purposely. He and Helen Hunt make an abnormal couple initially, a bit awkward, but solid acting by both makes it very, very real rather quickly. Frears reluctance amidst Noland's patience in union, ironically because it is usually the other way around, gives substance to their relationship. Both are passionate individuals who want each other more that they need each other. I believe they love each other.

Chuck's best friend in the movie is very sincere and earnest. Hanks' realizes how time obsessed he is with his job, then realizes he has let his best friend down. He has an inability to really offer emotional support. That gets tested and amazingly and intimately delved into later in the film.

During Christmas Noland's job calls him and one of the most amazing wreckage scenes (in terms of believably and realism, not morbidness) ensues leaving Chuck to float aimlessly, like his structured life, to a deserted island. A simple idea already used; however, Hanks is outstanding here.

His first instincts are pretty natural for he is not trying to survive, but merely hold over. We see him slowly give up hope of being rescued and turn over to staying alive. Noland finds some FedEx pieces and they literally, figuratively, and emotionally keep him alive, but for how long? Isolation is a killer and that is where Hanks co-star comes in. Hanks goes from outstanding to who will beat me for an Oscar (which was Crowe of course)? Time passes and Chuck's exterior is concurrent with time elapsed, including the makeup. Chuck's sun lesions to his bleached hair gives Hanks tremendous grit and believable desperation. Noland's mind remains very sharp and trivia on this site allow for some of the implausibilities, but certainly not impossibilities, from taking this movie down a notch. Also it is obvious Chuck is knowledgeable, learns continuously through observation, and travels enough that observation seems to occur quite a bit.

The best part is when Chuck is forced to give us backfill. It is an organization tool that doesn't detach or break up the movie. My credit is to Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for keeping this movie sharp until the end. The whole crew was meticulous and brilliant as seen in the ""making of special"" at the end of the movie.

The beauty of the island, of spiritually, of fate through choice is all explored here. And personally only Tom Hanks could have done it: which is the definition of Oscar.",10
20 August 2002,This movie sux. It sux and sux and sux...,"It sux for 143 minutes. That is awfully long for a boring Robinson Crusoe rip-off minus Friday (who made a boring novel a little less boring) plus permanent Fed EX product-placement. Much too long. Precisely 142 minutes and 40 seconds too long. Yes, this movie is actually the longest commercial known to man.

I wonder if Tom Hanks plans to star in tearjerkers for the rest of his career...

But even more I wonder how much longer audiences are going to fall for this kind of mass produced crap.

Hollywood, I loathe thee!

20 January 2001,Liked it a lot,"This is a great movie and Tom Hanks deserves much praise for it. His acting is excellent and his physical transformation very impressive. Helen Hunt's performance was sort but especially in the second part very good. I think the movie was very realistic in the scenes of Tom on the island, overall the movie works well.

26 December 2000,Hollywood gets existential,"A much smarter movie than I had expected: subversive modernism doesn't usually come out of big-budget filmmaking. The main character begins by teaching capitalism to Muscovites and ends by chasing Texan artists. That's quite a journey. And by the way, Helen Hunt was perfect as Ms. Convention: when offered what she really wanted, her only response was ""I'm terrified."" Hank's loss of weight is only one of the more obvious metaphors about losing fear, like floating on a raft on the sea.

29 November 2002,"I really, really liked this movie.","Wow. Another well deserved Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks. Most of this movie is with no dialogue, just Hanks' expressions. And aren't they one of the best expressions the movie industry has ever seen?

This movie is great. It makes you think, makes you wonder. What would you do if you (literally) lost EVERYTHING and EVERYONE whoever meant anything to you within just a few minutes? This is what it's about. One man's desire to live, his struggle to survive. The hope,that one day he will make it through all this, strengthened by his love for a woman who's face in a photo is the only human face he'll see for years. His loneliness only adds to his desperation, so much so that he befriends a volleyball, ""Wilson"", which he paints a face on (with his blood) and talks to all day. No replies in return, but just having it there is the only thing keeping him from going totally insane. Great performance from Helen Hunt too, although her role was short.

If you haven't seen this, go and rent it. Excellent, excellent movie. *****/*****",9
1 January 2004,Smart and breathtaking!,"Wow what an amazing movie. Wow what amazing acting. Robert Zemeckis is definately (still) one of my favourite directors. The script is extremely smart (except some little things) and well-written. Cinematography is awesome, so are the special effects. Well, in some places you see how Tom was copied onto the background (eg. ship going by the raft). The three scenes that amazed me most are the airplane crashdown (I sat there and held my breath!), the first time Tom climb up the big rock and looks down and the scene where he meets Helen again.

This movie's simply excellent. A class of its own in its genre. Worth watching and watching over again even just for Hanks' acting.

My ratings: acting 10/10 (tom hanks!), story 9/10, directing 9/10, cinematography 9/10, special effects 7.5/10, drama 7/10.

My overall rating: 9/10 - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE WHO APPRECIATES PERFECT ACTING!",
20 October 2012,An obvious advert for Fed-Ex,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",5
30 December 2000,A perfect exegesis of the existential plight of man.,"This movie beautifully confronts the attentive viewer with the essential challenge of existence. We are alone and we must each find a reason to live and a means to do so.

Tom Hanks is outstanding as he has been before in the role of everyman. And the film doesn't wimp out with a happy neat all-is-resolved ending, much to Roger Ebert's consternation.

11 November 2001,"Might have been a good movie, had they bothered to finish it.","I just wasted a chunk of my life watching this horrible awful movie. I enjoyed the ""survivalist"" mode of him being on the island, but that should've become the focus of the movie, and then they could've ended it when he gets found by the ship.

But no, we have to try and make it a character movie, or it's a mystery movie. Since they never really showed much characterization of Hanks' character before, it's really hard to say how his character was impacted apart from the run-of-the-mill ""love lost and moved on"" cliche'. Then, let's look at the mystery of ""what was that package?"" Sorry, no answer there. Not important, you say? Then see my characterization gripe.

I'd go into more, but I'm not going to waste my time further on it.

4 January 2001,A lackluster bore,"At times I felt as desperate as Hanks' character to get out of the movie theater. I checked my watch no fewer than six times. The attempts at literary symbolism were glaringly obvious, although not well-executed. There was some suspense with no surprises. Perhaps the book is worth reading, but I would not recommend viewing this film.

19 March 2011,A very absorbing movie,"Yes, it's too long. Yes, there are lots of goofs. And, if you watch closely enough, errors of time and place. But, this is one movie that is worth watching closely. Even if, as I found at the fourth sitting through a TV showing, you have to watch a raft of cleverly placed product-placement ads. OK, we know that FedEx comes out of it well. And Snickers bars. And Wilson the sports goods maker. But it does not improve a movie to show ads for men's deodorant. Nevertheless, it is a truly absorbing show. On TV the film runs for three hours. But it remains watchable. Looking back at the several versions of this film that I have seen, it is apparent that many viewers have not seen the original hardtop version. An example: In one TV version, the suicide attempt has been cut. In another, it is elaborated in a conversation between Chuck and his friend. Perhaps television broadcasters have their own agenda with regard to timing of programs. In one TV version there is much footage wasted with no significant visuals. Is this so that ads could be inserted by local operators? I believe that good movies (and this is a very good movie) deserve better.",9
21 August 2001,wake up...this is nothing special,"This movie is not good. Yes it has a great plane crash, but after the great suspense, Tom Hanks lives...damn. Wow... ""I can't believe Tom Hanks was on the screen by himself for soooo long""...well I can't believe so many people watched this garbage for soooo long and actually enjoyed it.

From what I understand Hanks has wanted to do this movie for a while. If it meant that much to him he really should have waited untill something better came along from the Hollywood script dept. Yes he performed a great physical transformation for this movie, but others have done just as well and for much better movies (DeNiro, Raging Bull).

Tom Hanks has done a great job in some great movies...he now has to try to keep himself known as a great actor...he now has the power to wait untill the next 'gump' or 'private ryan' comes along. But Hanks answered our question when we asked ""what do you do after playing a role that great in saving private ryan?"" You sign yourself up for ""You've Got Mail"" that's what you do.

They should have stopped after Gump...if ever again I hear the names Zemeckis and Hanks in a trailer I'll run like hell.

If you're interested in seeing some of 2000's best stay away from this highly overrated film.

""I Have Made FIRE..."" and now I will toss a copy of Cast Away into it...",4
30 December 2000,Only Hanks Could Have Pulled This Off,"There's not much dialogue, monologue, action sequences, special effects, explosions, grand musical scores, breath-taking scenes or the other stuff that usually stick in our minds. It's just Tom stranded on an island with no one to talk to and nothing to do.

That Tom could take this movie and totally keep my interest and thoroughly entertain me was incredible. For that Tom deserves major kudos and this film deserves its high praise. It's a great drama that explores the experience of living in total isolation and the human desire to live and our need for companionship.

27 December 2000,Everything The Perfect Storm was not. Just extraordinary.,"It's not necessary to use many words to describe this movie, as it doesn't use many to tell its story. Awesome silence and aching loneliness mold and sculpt (literally) a man who must deal with cruel fate and cruel nature. The waves that come crashing in on his little island to imprison him as surely as steel bars are far more real, real looking and fearful than the computer-generated fakes in The Perfect Storm. This is the real thing. Tom Hanks is a shoo-in for a Best Actor nomination.

25 June 2021,Expectations Met,"In my honest opinion Castaway is nothing short of a safe viewing. That's not to say it's great or terrible, just about as good as throwing Tom Hanks on an island and watching him survive sounds. At times the runtime does drag a little, especially when you can't help but begin to question where this is really going, as there are only two options realistically, he gets off the island, he doesn't. That being said, Tom Hanks makes use of his acting chops here by delivering a gripping performance. Though I can't speak for the realism of certain circumstances, that doesn't for a second stop this from being a really entertaining film.

21 January 2001,well up with some tears and experience a moment of passing profundity,"Stories about being stranded on a desert island have an elemental appeal to the human imagination, so it seems appropriate that the premier spinner of high tech cinematic fables  Robert Zemeckis - would step up to the plate with his 21st century spin on the tale. Interestingly the title Cast Away is rendered as two separate words. Could this be a way to emphasize that the cast of the movie is away for most of the film. Perhaps it's because cast member Tom Hanks is also a producer and collaborator on the film, hinting that `cast away' may be a little like `anchors aweigh' where `the new' Hollywood launches another tale of Everyman for a politically, morally, and spiritually confused and transitioning time. It's time to take stock of ourselves in our high paced world. Who better to take us through that journey than the common man du jour, Mr. Hanks. Like Forrest Gump, or with anything featuring Tom Hanks or directed by Zemeckis, the film has quality and integrity. Life is struggle, we all go too fast, we don't value the really important things in life, love is powerful and enduring, fate works in strange ways, life is what you make it. Their themes are crystal clear, bordering on painfully obvious. That's OK, too, because great effects and fabulous scenery in service to good commercial filmmaking is virtuous and inevitably appealing, not to mention boffo box office. The three part structure of the film is therefor entirely appropriate. Those who feel the rescue section (I won't say what happens  just in case) doesn't work, miss the purpose of the storytelling. It is not created to make us leave the theater in an existential quandary, but to be entertained, well up with some tears, experience a moment of passing profundity, and briefly ponder a few big questions. Expecting the film to do otherwise is like having Johnny Appleseed sow his seeds across the America only to find out they never sprouted. The film's artificiality is part of its appeal. Perhaps that's why I find myself watching the credits until the very end. I needed to find out whether the large crab on the spear caught by the Hank's character at in the beginning of his island stay was real or animatronics. It was animatronics.",
25 December 2005,Cast out to sea. Never to return,"If I didn't know that Tom Hanks starred in movies like ""Forrest Gump"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"", I would have given him all the Oscars there is. ""Cast Away"" is the brilliant story of survival, in every word of the title, of a FedEx shipper who stays on and island and manages to survive in complete isolation for 4 years, without any phone connections, and living with a volleyball that he later becomes friendly with, Wilson, and icon for all of us who need someone to talk to, even if its inanimate.

As I watched this movie, time and time again, I picked up on some ways of survival, ways of starting things socially, as once again, Robert Zemeckis can keep an audience captivated by the one movement of one man, of the one man who can make a major difference. Its hard to say whether people can learn, or debate by watching this flick, by saying all the garbage about how someone can really do it. Switch yourself with Hanks for a week, and then lets talk about how manly someone is.

Helen Hunt, who plays Kelly, and Hanks, who plays the brilliantly stable Chuck Noland, have great chemistry together, as both light up the screen with flavor and pizazz, which seems that no movie nowadays possesses. Watching this movie will make you frightened, and make you cry, but the lessons are numerous.

Ready to take on the next 4 years of your life? OK. Now, here's the challenge, unplug your TV and disconnect your telephone and computer systems. Now that you're ready, open up the new page in your life and

Begin.",9
8 June 2001,Another great to many greats for Hanks!,"Cast Away could only of been successful through one actor alone....and that actor is Tom Hanks. This guy has to go down as one of the best actors of all time. The plot of cast away is straight forward as you'd gather from the title.

Tom Hanks plays the part of Chuck Noland who is a FeDex operative transporting packages by air. The plane nose dives into the ocean through bad weather and only Chuck comes away alive, he then drafts to an unchartered island where he is on his own.

The crash scene was very brutal and it almost made me look at flying in a completely different way, then i convinced myself ""it is a film"". But the scene was so realistic that it can honestly change your opinion. Hanks, once on the island, is very capturing, you see him struggle to survive and then LEARN to survive.

The acting by Hanks alone should of beaten off Russell Crowe for the Oscar i feel. He shows great emotion and presence within the movie to back that statement.

This is another great movie to go in Tom Hanks' record of achievement and its another great film to go into my collection.

9/10.",9
30 December 2000,A nice pot roast but not filet mignon,"Cast Away is a fine movie for mainstream Hollywood. It is a Sears kind of movie. Nothing too offensive or challenging, stays on main street, no forays into the darker sides of the psyche. Hanks chooses his vehicles well, as compared to many of the other male superstars like Hanks and Gibson who have sold out completely. I found the plot a bit contrived, and the most impressive special effect was the Hanks weight loss. Helen Hunt is in too many movies. Period. She needs to take a vacation.

28 December 2000,I wanted to see more of Helen Hunt,"I think the drama at the end of the picture would have been enhanced if we had occasionally been given a look at what Hunt (Hanks's fiancee) was going through while Hanks was on the island. I can't discuss specifics without spoiling here, but we learn about Helen Hunt's agonizing decisions only after Hanks gets back to civilization. It would have been more interesting for me to see what she was going through parallel to, and intercut with, what Hanks was dealing with on his island. I think the failure to do so accounts for my being able to leave the theater dropping only a few tears, instead of spouting a gusher.

27 January 2001,Is there anything Mr. Hanks can do wrong?,"Forget 'The Beach' (not hard), this is the best desert island flick of them all. It's funny, moving, poignant, and Tom Hanks is outstanding. However I only gave it an 8 because it goes all schmaltzy at the end, which is a common mistake (just see 'The Family Man' for God's sake). Robert Zemeckis directs it well, as per usual, and as mentioned, Hanks is a marvel. You become captivated by watching his actions on the island, especially those involving Wilson the volleyball. Hanks does many bizarre things like eat live fish and do dentistry on himself, which are fun to watch (if not a little sickening). Not totally brilliant, but it's so engaging you'll hardly care. A must for fans of Hanks and director Zemeckis.

1 February 2001,Cast Away? Perhaps that should be Cast Out,"I'll start by admitting that Tom Hanks does nothing for me as an actor. In fact, I think his only two decent films to date are Big and Philidelphia - and that's at a stretch. I went into the film with a healthy dose of skepticism, but was fully prepared to be surprised. Oh well, one outta two ain't bad!

This is the sort of film where, if someone asked me what it was like, I respond with ""the cinematography was very good"". Hanks joins Robert Zemeckis for the first time since Forrest Gump (don't even get me started on that waste of film).

The story itself is one of survival (d'uh!). Chuck is a jet-setting Fed-Ex efficiency expert who jumps on a plane, and the plane decides to jump into the ocean. Chuck survives and has to eke out a living on a deserted island. That's all there is to it really. Oh, he's kept company by a picture of his girlfriend, Kelly and a volleyball named Wilson.

There were some fleeting glimpses of brilliance in the film - how Chuck overcomes adversity living on an island, cooking, fires, home dentistry etc, but nothing too extraordinary. In fact, boring in parts. I think the film could have benefited from cuts to what's happening back home while he's on the island - mind you it would have meant involvement from the other actors - which would have spoiled the ""Tom Hanks alone in Cast Away"" effect of the film. Oh OK, credit where credit is due, Hanks did trim down fantastically for the film, and he looks, well, not that bad! I think taut would be the word. But that's enough gushing! Fed-Ex too, must be rubbing its hands in glee with the free advertising this film has provided for them.

It's a film that I wouldn't recommend highly to people, but at the same time, it's OK and worth a trip to see it on the big screen (because I think it'll lose a bit on the TV).

Now would someone please explain to me why Tom Hanks keeps winning these damn Oscars, because I'm stumped.",6
26 January 2001,Predictable With No Real Insight,"Now, the predictable part didn't bother me much, because I was expecting the movie to delve into the psyche of the main character and reveal something profound about humanity. Instead the film is extrmeley shallow. Here is the question the movie poses: What would it be like to be stranded on an island? Now, the average person has certain preconceptions when thinking about this question. The job of the movie is to provide depth and material which forces the viewer to reconsider these preconceptions. No such material exists in the film. It has the intellectual blandness that is typical of popcorn movies, but with most of the action removed. As a result, the movie failed to hold my interest. Besides this basic failing, there are also some minor nitpicks.

The film took the more marketable and typical gender designations with the male being lost on an adventure, and the woman at home. This formula has been around since The Odyssey and I would have liked to see Helen Hunt and Tom Hanks reverse their roles. But, seeing a woman on screen without make-up and perfect hair? A woman who can survive alone? We can't have that now.... In addition, no one spears fish standing twenty feet away from the target. It just isn't done. Tom Hanks also was remarkably chubby and healthy looking during the first few days on the island.

After returning from the island, the movie cheats us by magically producing a Tom Hanks who has managed to reintegrate himself into society in a mere four days. Sure, he's a little reserved, but after four years alone his behaviorisms would take a wee bit longer to disappear. The scenes with Helen Hunt manage to be painfully melodramatic which is quite an achievement considering that the situation would seem to allow for melodrama. Finally, I predicted the appearance of the beautiful woman in the final scene about a minute before she showed up which was depressing. It suggests that all a lost man needs to provide him with some direction in his life is some other pretty girl in too much make-up. So, all in all some nice scenery but not enough to make up for the films inability to inspire thought in the viewer.",
29 March 2001,This is what i call acting,"Tom Hanks doesn't ramble on and on and on. He doesn't make complex forts like in other movies of the same nature. He doesn't make complex hunting tools. He doesn't befriend the wildlife around him. He sits and he sits thinking about who he loves the most. The silence on the beach which in a way made you feel his pain. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar, but no he got robbed because he had already won 2. I refuse now, not to watch another show for the rest of my life. Did you feel his pain when he lost his beloved friend Wilson the vollyball. I did. Did you feel his pain when you found out he had lost he most beloved friend. I did. I advise you to watch this film and to not judge it right after you see it, just think about it.

29 September 2021,roleplaying,"Tom Hanks' work on the role was just amazing.

I admire the way he worked out his flabby tummy into Bakibaki abdominal muscle.

*Bakibaki is Japanese.

However, I felt the movie was a bit long.

It could have been a little more compact.

As Tom Hanks, there are no violent sexual scenes, so even those with children can easily enjoy this movie.

21 February 2001,A metaphor for Life!,"Not being a fan of either Tom Hanks, Robert Zemekis or American movies in general, I wasn't expecting much from `Cast Away'. It was an extremely hot day in Adelaide that day, and the closest movie theatre seemed to be the best escape from the heat. I walked out of this film feeling fully entertained, plus taking with me much food for thought.

None of the performances moved me terribly, but I found the screenplay most interesting. It was obvious to me that the story itself was a metaphor for life, and within this was a strong message to us all. Whatever message you take away will depend on your basic values.

The story covered the 3 stages of life - - I know everything, and I can do what I like - Good grief, I don't know everything, and now I have to learn about life from the ground up - I can rejoin the human race, but I'm changed beyond recognition. The catalyst to Stage 2 in the film was the plane crash, and Tom Hanks' character being stranded on a remote and uninhabited island. For the rest of the human race, this catalyst is generally far more subtle, but it inevitably leaves us feeling that our lives are out of our control. Feeling out of control is generally a neon sign that change is needed.

Whether the screenwriter intended this film to be a metaphor I can't say, but the result is a sharply and succinctly edited piece, which is so unlike other `big' American movies. I welcomed the change - it was like a breath of fresh Pacific Island air!",
28 December 2000,Another Great one from Zemeckis,"I Love his movies. They are filled with detail. Sometimes you don't realize until a day or two later how much detail is dropped into a Zemeckis film. It is in the details that his stories are really brought to life. At face value I would have given Cast Away a 5 of 10 as an average movie. Then I started rolling over it in my head and when I awoke from a realistic dream about that tiny island Tom Hanks was deserted on I knew it was more the first washes across you. You have to watch it more than once I decided. You HAVE to look for all the details. The religious symbolism. The Major Zemeckis theme throughout many of his films: Fate versus Free Will. The Man Vs. Nature. The Comedy is an average man's faults. These are the things a Bob Zemeckis film explores and makes you feel.

I loved this film. I give it a nomination for Best Director and I give it 50-50 odds of winning. I nominate it for Best Picture. It will be a close race with Almost Famous and The Grinch. Tom Hanks is definitely a nominee for Best Actor. He was simply REAL. There is no better performance this year. Maybe an equal, but no better performance. Amazing.

As I said, at first glance I didn't like it much. The ending was something I didn't like. After some time to re-think it through I think the ending is brilliant.

This is one of the three best films of 2000. Go see it for yourself.",8
7 December 2021,I haven't been disappointed,"Eventually I took the opportunity to watch Cast Away and it exceeded my expectations. I don't like Tom Hanks and his movies and this one was again It is really amazing how he does not show any emotions. Even a volleyball is more intriguing.

Some examples: mute the movie an replace sounds as follows: Scene when he is on the beach... Monty Python... Scene when he is at the airport and got told the truth... a movie when a guy is waiting for his prom girl Scene when he & H Hunt walks in the room with maps on the table ... Da Vinci Code

If the audience would not know the story and development of the plot, no one would know what each scene is about. Take a picture of a random scene in Cast Away and ask someone who didn't watch the movie what it is about. There will be 1000 different answers, completely contrary to each other.

Right after Cast Away I saw some indi movie with, at this time unknown actors. There wa s scene when the kids got told about the fate of the mother. The emotiona expression of those unknown unexperienced actors looked so real. I could take a picture of this scene and everyone would understand what was going on at this movement in the movie.",3
23 March 2001,Pretty good - but too bad someone from Fedex didn't edit it.,"We're going through another puffed-up time in film making. This is a good story, with a good cast - all brought together by a good director... who's had too many hits. In this film, after 25 minutes, we've learned about as much as good writing and editing could have shown us in 5 minutes. But it just might be that we have a situation where no one can tell this very successful director, ""Hey, we need to chop this thing.""

It's a terrific story with a survival segment sandwiched in the middle. The structure is valid (we see how the protagonist loses his obsession with time), though I'm probably in the minority in saying that the middle third is just another man-stranded-on-island story.

It's the relationship story that I loved, and it would have been even more effective if it could have been condensed. For example, we start with an entire segment in Russia. But why? Just to show the humor of trying to teach Russians the value of time?

I hope the reason for this movie's 148-minute length isn't to teach the audience not to worry about time.

Then we have a long Christmas dinner scene with 16 people at the table. A bit of gabbing, some holiday cheer... How does this help the story? What do we learn? Mainly that Hanks has a tooth-ache.

Instead of a trip to Russia and a big dinner scene, I would have loved getting to know the Helen Hunt character better. It could only have made the final third even more poignant.

As it is, we have a good flick that feels it needs to give you more minutes for your money. I would have preferred more impact.

It's a shame one of the Fedex people - one a bit more cognizant of time passing - couldn't have put in a good word or two.",5

18 February 2006,absolutely terrible,"I seriously cannot believe people like this movie. It was, what, three hours, of Tom Hanks running around in a beard talking to himself and a volleyball? I'm not one to knock Tom Hanks-God knows he's a wonderful actor. The man could make the phonebook seem interesting-just not for three hours. Yuck. His talent was squandered on this movie. *HERE BE SPOILERS* So, was the point of the whole thing at the end about what the tide is going to bring? Because it could have been done in a shorter amount of time. The whole movie was just completely depressing-his girl, the only thing that basically kept him alive, turns out to be married and has a kid. And I can't help but think if the schmucks had looked harder for him, or if the plastic thing had floated up sooner, the poor guy could have been spared so much more. Yes, yes, he wouldn't have ""learned,"" but truthfully what did he learn? That his girl wouldn't wait for him, that he wasn't there for his friends, that he could make fire? Yay. Go to Boy Scout camp to play ""roughing it""-don't get stuck on an island for four years. With a sick tooth and an ugly volleyball.

Not for children or those who like constant action. Disappointing last 1/2 hour and the very end was so off the wall it would have been better omitted. But definitely worth seeing.

25 June 2001,"Strong first and second acts, worth contemplating.","Cast Away had strong first and second acts. Well, the middle part was most of the movie but Tom Hanks again does a fine job and it leaves you contemplating and thinking about your own chances in that situation. Of course, you'll never want to get on a plane again.

But the third act, is weak. I will not reveal what happens except to say that Zemeckis doesnt quite achieve the same impact that hangs with you during the middle part. Some bad writing and cheesy acting (angel wings girl...ugh !) but all in all, the quality is pretty good. Worth seeing.

6 December 2001,one of the years best,"Tom Hanks gives another Oscar worthy performance as a time obsessed Fed Ex worker who, after a stunning plane crash, gets stranded on a deserted Island for about 4 years. During this time wee see Hanks become self-sufficient and more mature. He learns to forget about the unimportant things in life and focus on the most important, like trying to survive. He also begins to lose his mind, the only thing keeping him alive is the thought of being reunited with his girlfriend, Helen Hunt. Cast Away is a truly unique film. The hour and a half of Hanks on the Island contain practically no music and very little dialog. In fact Hanks' only company is that of a volleyball with a face on it. This may sound a little dull, but it isn't. The film runs about 2 hours and 40 minutes but it zooms right by and I felt it wasn't long enough, and that more time needed to spent on the island. The most interesting thing about this movie is just watching Hanks try to survive. To see how a person adapts to conditions they have never experienced is always a fascinating thing. The film is also beautifully shot and director Robert Zemeckis does a wonderful job of showing Hanks' isolation. Not only is this one of the best films of the year, but it will probably be loved by anyone who sees it.",9
30 December 2000,Gilligan's Island it is not.,"Cast Away has to be the most boring, uninspired movie of 2000. Going into the film (from the previews) I knew that Tom Hanks was going to be involved in a plane crash and stranded on a deserted island. And seeing that Helen Hunt was the supporting star/billing ho, it was pretty obvious that he'd be back to his Memphis home town (where seemingly, a'la Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, everyone has a southern accent except Hanks).

So what happens between that time? Everything you'd expect. He aims to survive. Food, clothing, shelter, Fed Ex shipments... But there is no tension, no drama, no suspense, and despite what Hollywood is hyping as some 20 minutes of gripping silence, there is no good acting. So you end up not caring, and it doesn't get much worse when you don't care what happens to the star of the show.

I felt sorry for Gilligan, he was too inept to rescue himself. But I won't feel sorry for Tom Hanks. Especially if he makes ""Cast Away II.... And the Harlem Globetrotters.""",2
24 October 2001,Third act fails the movie,"CAST AWAY

--01/13/01

It's a great Hanks performance vehicle ruined by a seemingly tacked-on conclusion. The film could have ended with Hanks' character being either rescued or Zemeckis could have shown us those conveniently missing four weeks. Those alone could have been a movie within themselves. But all in all, I enjoyed my time with the film.

Serious film-goers will note that one beach scene _obviously_ gives a nod to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Hanks' self-professed favorite movie and mine as well.

20 July 2002,Fascinating,"I've got to admit, this movie is one of the finest I have ever seen. Not only it focuses on survival, it also has an interesting field on how we can enjoy those many things that keeps on fascinating us. We all know that there is a saying, ""no man is an island"", well, beleive me, everything can be possible if we try to look deep in our hearts, on what we really want and what we can really focus on. For all those things, Cast Away gives an example for every one of them. It gives us inspirations to lead us to a life full of enlightment, and love for oneself. Not only this movie gives these valuable messages in life, but for me, it does tell us how beautiful the world really is. And on how we can love and interact with it, for all our problems and struggles we can just look at on how pretty the world is. For me, this movie is one big inspiration and will be one important part in my life.

I read stuff like Tom Hanks not talking for half an hour and Hollywood dribble and I had to be dragged off to see it. I really was much better then I expected. It never lags and is full of action, suspense and interesting themes. You don't watch Tom Hanks on the Island for 30mins you see Chuck Noland. It is really a great film and I was surprised it was as good as it was. Don't let other critics jade your idea of this movie cause it really is a very good movie. Go see it now.

10 December 2001,Lovely adventure,"I must say I did not watch the film at the cinema because friends had told me it was not as good as it seemed. However, I have had the chance to watch it on video, and I must say that I really enjoyed it.

One must admit, its a slow moving film. However, it is rich with emotion. A common person, with no survival skills, who discovers things we take for granted along this adventure - fire, food, water, shelter, and even companionship.

This film is not highly recommended for the adrenaline hungry, although it must say that the plane accident at the beginning is realistically frightening. Its a film which will appeal for the patient viewer who likes a story.

You will inevitably continue asking yourself: what would i do next if i were him?

30 October 2006,a really enjoyable and exciting movie.,"I enjoyed this movie throughly.

I do not normally watch movies with Hanks as the lead as i find them pretty dull. This was an exception.

I saw this on TV and thought it was really well done. The scene were Hanks plane crashes, and he finds himself on an island were he must work with nature is especially well done. The lighting and waves were excellent.

The character Hanks plays, is an uptight and busy man. When he goes to the island, he meets his worst nightmare, Time. With nothing to do and no comforts he makes himself friends. He takes a simple volleyball, names it and with this, remines sane.

I have only three small faults with this movie. The first is that the time on the island is a little short. He doesn't even spend half the movie here.

This isn't really a fault is just me but does anybody ever wonder what is IN THAT STUPID BOX?? Sorry, but really what's in it? He says he saves his life with that box, so what's in it? Tell me if you know please, sophielambe@hotmail.com . Thanks.

This is also not a fault but there should be a sequel!!",8
16 January 2002,Sooo Boring,"Man what to say. I can't figure out why people praised this movie. It was basically Tom Hanks on an island for 4 years and hardly saying a word. You never have a cut back to see what his wife may be thinking or has done or doing. Nope, you find all that out at the end when he is rescued. But boring,boring boring. Too long as well. Sorry Tom even you can't save this flick from either being swept away by an undercurrent or deserted and forgotten. I am not a Tom Hanks fan either so maybe that contributed to it I don't know. Avoid it people, don't wast $5 on renting it. Rent something with some excitement for that.

7 July 2001,Experience all 143 of its 143 minutes...,"There are long movies that seem as though they were half the length because they were able to keep your attention and take you in to the films environ. ""Cast Away"" isn't one of them. ""Cast Away"" belongs to that select group of long films where you begin dreading the halfway point because there's still half left.

The film was technically sound, but disappointingly lacing in emotional context. There's very little done to make you care for the main character, though you do fell sorry that he wasn't smart enough to take the clothes from something that washes up on shore.

All in all, a dull film; not because it lacks action (it does) but because it just isn't that interesting or deep.

My suggestion, see ""Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N."".

28 April 2001,Hooray for Wilson!,"I have seen this movie twice and both times when I walked out, there were people complaining about the movie and declaring that it was boring and unlikeable. I would have to say the opposite. The plane crash was extremely realistic and intense and happens quickly after the movie begins. The action on the island is RIVETING. You are constantly interested to find out what Chuck Noland does next and it is amazing how he is able to use the contents of the FedEx boxes. Tom Hanks turns in a fabulous performance with little words and big gestures, and also by losing weight for an awesome transformation after his four years on the island. He was ROBBED to not get the Oscar for Best Actor this year. The movie even made a mere volleyball an interesting character. You scoff now, but you'll grow to love Wilson and his tree hair extensions. In any other movie, there would have been typical Hollywood details thrown in... a beautiful mermaid living on the island to keep Chuck company, a shark attack while he is riding on his raft, Chuck managing to have a packet of waterproof matches on him when his ship goes down... ANYTHING unrealistic. This movie manages to stay true to its cause and explores the dire situation of being stranded out on an island in a simple, yet effective way. The ending of the movie was a bit overdrawn, but the ""ambiguous"" ending satisfied me, so that I could come up with my own ending for Chuck. When you first hear that the movie has Tom Hanks in nearly an hour of film time with dialogue... you wonder how it can be entertaining. But oh boy, it surely is. Don't miss it.

3 January 2001,Surprised,"My friends called me and asked me if I want to go to the movies. I said sure why not, what movie do you want to see? They said ""Cast Away"". At that point, here's why I thought:

1) I don't like Tom Hanks that much.

2) The movie is about him being lost on an island alone, which means it probably is boring.

But seeing that it's the no.1 movie on the boxoffice and that it's getting good reviews, I went along. The bottom line is: I enjoyed the movie. Of course it's not perfect, but it is well done in general.

TOM HANKS:

He did a good job. I didn't like some of his acting. For example, during the whole plane crash and when he was in the sea/waves/thunders right after, Tom Hanks didn't make a sound. Not even ONE SOUND, not a scream, not an ""Oh My God"", not a ""Help"", not a ""AHH!!"". I do not get it, for me it doesn't make sense. He must have been terrified during the crash and complete silence does not portray that. Other then that, I thought he did a good job although once again, the whole movie evolves around him. It's like he's the big star of the movie, who cares about the others. It's always like that in his movies, it's always about HIM. I am surprised the movie wasn't titled ""Tom Hanks"". But anyways, it's no big deal.

Also, as soon as he landed on the island, his actions weren't normal. He started screaming for help before even moving one meter and checking where he is. Anyways.

THE MOVIE:

There's not many scenes that I didn't like. I was entertained the whole time. Wilson must have payed huge money for this. There were some funny moments, some intense moments, drama, action. It's well-balanced.

All in all, I enjoyed the movie, and I recommend it to anyone. 8/10.",8
10 March 2001,...yet ANOTHER film masterpiece...,"From the Filmgod who bought us classics such as the Back to the Future Series, and Forrest Gump, comes yet ANOTHER film masterpiece. Top this off with Hollywood Legend and Mr Nice Guy Tom Hanks in the starring role, as well as one of the best screenplays to hit the Big Screen in a long time. This movie is GREAT! Tom Hanks truly deserves his oscar nomination for Best Actor, and I DEFINITELY recommend it. It's subtle, its funny, and it's brilliantly pieced together.

This is the story of Chuck Noland, an employee of FedEx who thinks time is of the essence. What happens on the airplane when he's flying to Malaysia will change his life forever. And it takes a while for him to ""rejuvenate"" after his experiences.

28 December 2000,Quietly Compelling,"How many actors would you pay to watch alone on screen for nearly an hour and a half? Casting Tom Hanks in Cast Away is a no-brainer. Not many other working actors could carry this film or even Tom Hanks' loincloth. Director Robert Zemeckis won the first battle just getting Hanks to star. He won another battle getting Fed Ex to agree to be featured in the greatest product placement since ET's Reese's Pieces. Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland, an executive with Fed Ex, who flies from meeting to meeting on the company's cargo jets. He has to survive one of those plane's crashing and learn to thrive on a deserted island in the south Pacific. I have to admit, I was thinking about the TV show Survivor as he struggled to catch food and make fire. But, sadly for Chuck (Hanks), there were no reward challenges to provide him with the occasional call home or water proof matches. Cast Away is such an appropriate title for this film, because not only is Chuck a castaway, but for Hanks, the rest of the Cast is Away. Most people feel Tom Hanks is a talented actor, but also an interesting person, I think, someone we'd like, if we hung with the Hollywood crowd. And, whether that was Chuck Noland out there on the island or Hanks, I didn't get bored watching him get acclimated to his lonely life, because I cared about him. One of my younger co-workers says he was bothered by the fact that there was no soundtrack and the quiet of many of the island scenes. I would hate to generalize by age group, but the silence didn't disturb me at all. I didn't even notice it until later in the film when I thought, `Hey, they should have some big building orchestrated music here!' I think the lack of background noise was perfect for the movie. All you can hear most times is the relentless crashing of the waves on the beach and reef, and that's a terrific scene setter. Mostly, I love Cast Away for what was left out of the film. There are some major questions left unanswered when the credits roll. That's so cool! Studios seem to want everything tied up in a neat package at the end of movies. Could Cast Away be the start of some novel trend? Let's hope so. Cast Away is rated PG-13 for intense action sequences and some disturbing images, including the death of a toy. Cast Away earns three and a half stars, on my scale 0-5. Bottom line, if you like Tom Hanks, you'll like this movie. And, if you too live and die by time, be sure you've got two hours and 23 minutes to enjoy him.",7
17 February 2022,I wonder how meaningful this movie is!,"Whenever I watch it, I get a different and impactful meaning of every scene. The transformation, the acting and the screenplay can not be better than what cast away has shown. Anyways I am a great Robert Zemeckis fan and he always gives me reason to love him even more.

31 December 2000,One of the few movies of 2000 I thoroughly enjoyed,"The TV spots really did give too much away, wouldn't you say?

Despite this, the movie was quite solid. Hanks impressed me with his work on the island, watching his struggles and successes during the ultimate test of survival skills. The mood of the film was nice -- I appreciated the quiet diligence that surrounded all the mundane tasks Hanks had to master shortly after being stranded .... I felt immersed in the solitude Hanks' character was thrust into following the crash.

Not only did his behavior seem ""right,"" for lack of a better word, but his survival of the brutal plane crash (what a scene!) didn't seem too outlandish. His behavior upon returning to civilization was perfect, too -- the silent nods and gestures given to all the well-wishers who welcomed him back, the impression that he felt crowded -- can you tell I was impressed with his work?!

I will agree with the naysayers on one point: Hunt and Hanks have zero chemistry. The best part of their relationship seemed to take place when he was on the island and she was a still picture inside his watch. Well, OK, here's a second point: The ""I'll be right back"" line was .... ick. Why bother?

Amazing how well (and to such depth) a story can be told without much dialogue. My favorite segment of the movie started at the crash and lasted until the birth of Wilson. I connected with the feelings Hanks was trying to convey through his actions .... very satisfying!

I do wonder this: Did you or the people you watched this movie with laugh much during this movie? There was laughter in the theater that I felt was misplaced .... maybe I respected the film too much? Whatever. A good movie in a bad year, but not because it was a bad year. This movie would have held up in most years.",
9 August 2006,"Should have been called ""Survival"" if only for the effort to get through it","Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",4
2 January 2001,"Exciting, bittersweet film with a clear message.","Tom Hanks will probably win an Oscar for his portrayal of Chuck Nolan. I was very impressed with this movie. I was expecting a remake of Robinson Crusoe, but this is more of a love story than an adventure (albeit a very bittersweet love story). The message, clearly stated by Hanks, is that you must carry on no matter what, because the sun will rise tomorrow, and you never know what the tide may bring.

25 September 2006,Cartoons run the world!,"I have to give more credit to cartoons for my cinematic education than I tend to like to admit. If it hadn't been for my early love of Warner Bros. cartoons, I probably never would have seen many of the films from the '40s that I have, and almost certainly wouldn't have entered my longtime infatuation with filmmakers like Welles and Hitchcock. 'The Simpsons' got me to watch more current classics to get their injokes, and now 'Family Guy' has brought the trend up to the newest films. So, that's why I watched 'Cast Away' when it came on television, though I otherwise had no other interest in it. And once again, I have to thank cartoons for broadening my horizons just that bit farther. I won't rehash the story of 'Cast Away,' since it's surely been done enough on this site and even if it hadn't it's pretty much in the title! I will simply say Tom Hanks has done another surprising job while staying within the confines of his nonacting (the only time I've seen him be other than 'Tom Hanks as...' was probably 'The Road to Perdition'), and that's fortunate since he has the responsibility of carrying most of this film himself. The story is another 'Robinson Crusoe' kind of affair, with a volleyball standing in for Friday. If I have any issue with this movie, it's that it didn't follow more truly the formula of such films: too much in-society, not enough cast-away. And that's IF I have an issue with it... This is not a great film. The direction is utterly straightforward and the writing is only as good as it needs to be. The ending is a little much after what is a fairly simple concept tale, but I'll leave it at that. So, see 'Cast Away' if you've nothing better to do. At the very least, it'll give you a leg up on the latest parodic cartoons. At the most, it's a decent enough picture that won't make you feel like you've wasted the last hour and a half...like 'Coyote Ugly.'",7
21 February 2001,The best film that I have seen so far this year,"I enjoyed this film because it had a touch of realism and the event portrayed could happen to anybody who flies frequently, that is if one was lucky enough to survive a sea crash. The actual crash was well done and very convincing.

I liked the way the film began and ended. It related fate, something to which we all suffer. I was left really wanting to know if Chuck was going to have a new life with the lady who owned the Fed Ex which he returned. It would make a nice sequel film.

It is easy to find fault with Chucks stay on the island. How did he survive looking so well for four years with not enough food and wood for his stomach and fire. How did he avoid fatal infection after being cut so badly and his rescue was most unlikely. But remembering that it was only a story, the acting by Tom Hanks deserves an award, the direction was excellent and effects well done. I would like to know if many stunt men were used. The story jumped around and left large gaps. It would have been good to have these gaps filled and the film longer.

Congratulations to the production team for an excellent and enjoyable film.",
13 July 2001,Worst Tom Hanks Movie,"I couldn't wait to see this movie,,, after all it was staring Tom Hanks, it had to be good. Boy was I wrong! Almost everyone I spoke to about this movie agreed it was not worth seeing. I had a good mind to demand my money back. I really do like Tom Hanks and have enjoyed much of his work, but not this time. The crash seen was great and the first few minutes on the island was good too but what next?? Suddenly it was 4 years later...come on... do they really expect us to believe that the only thing he did for 4 years was open 5 packages (I counted at least 16) and learned to fish and how to eat raw fish without getting sick? I am for the most part a city girl and even I could have thought of more to do on the island than that. I could go into details about what he did and didn't do and what he could have done but that would take too long. Let's just say that I would strongly not recommend this movie to anyone and I would be shocked if it got any kind of award.

28 October 2001,Superb!,"I cannot understand the negative comments regarding this movie. I thought Hanks was superb and it puts you in the position of a man stranded, in a very realistic way. All the way through the film, I found myself in thinking of being in that situation and what steps I would take.

I am quite an unemotional person, especially with films, but the scene when Hanks little, self made friend went bobbing away into the distance of the ocean reduced me to tears. I watched the film on my own and was blubbing like a baby. All in all, a great movie.

30 June 2001,Cast Back to where you once belonged.,"I don't know what William Broyler Jr. was thinking when he wrote the end of this film, but I hate him every day for it. Cast Away is a really good movie with a really bad ending. I was so deeply involved in this movie until Tom Hanks (who proves he is still a God to the acting community), got off the island. Helen Hunt? What's up? Hunt does such a poor job in this movie I was wondering if As Good As it Gets wasn't a fluke. And if you want to know about any of the other actors, trust me, WHO CARES. The only other ""actor"" worth talking about, is a volley ball named Wilson. I love Wilson and would watch a movie about what happened to Wilson. Hell, if you've ever seen the end of this movie then you know that it would be better to watch Wilson's voyage. Advise to the director: ""Stop going so soft. America is ready to see little Tommy Hanks do big kid stuff. Please give us more credit, we understand more than you do."" *** (THREE OUT OF FOUR STARS)

25 November 2003,Great film,"""Cast Away"" is a great film! I couldn't believe all the negative comments on this one. I mean, sure it's a slow-paced movie and it has a simple storyline and you know what's gonna happen at the end, but Tom Hanks shines in this! This is one of his best movies. It's right up there with Philadelphia (awesome movie) and Forrest Gump, which are the two movies he won Oscars for. He is such an amazing actor. The plane crash scene is very nerve-racking and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. But I just loved watching the scenes of him alone on that island trying to survive. I thought the fact that all he had to talk to was a volleyball named Wilson was very creative. Some scenes made me cringe, like when he had to knock that tooth out of his mouth with a skate and a rock. Ouch! I also cringed at the parts where he cut his leg on the coral and his feet on the sharp rocks in the water. Thank God there weren't any sharks around! This movie makes you think. What WOULD you do if you were stranded on a deserted island all by yourself? This film was also very sad. He loved Helen Hunt so much and he kept her picture all those years. Then he finds out she's married to HIS doctor and they've got a child after he's rescued. The scene where he lost Wilson was also kind of sad. That was his only friend for four years! The transformations that Tom had to go through to make this movie were also amazing. He truly is one of the best actors out there. This is one of the greatest movies ever made and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I am so glad I own it on DVD now. Thanks for reading my review.",
28 March 2001,A Superlative Performance,"After seeing Cast Away, you realize just why Tom Hanks is our generation's finest actor! To be able to carry off a movie on his own with liitle or no dialogue for major sections of the movie is quite the achievement, not to mention the difficult conditions that the movie was shot under and the physical demands of the role as well. Although, there are parts of the movie that feel rather stunted, it is a movie about a man stranded on an island and trying to cope with loneliness and survival on his own. What I loved was the middle part, when he's on his own, but there is no music, no drama, just Tom Hanks, and the sights and sounds of the island around him..Ahhh..I lust after that tranquility..don't get me wrong!! I don't ever wanna be stranded..I think I'd die within days:-)) The Academy chose Russell Crowe instead for Best Actor. Now, I am an Aussie myself(well, Indian born, but true blue at heart) and I was glad for Russell, he's a gem of an actor, but it truly did belong to one guy who wasn't even nominated!!! Michael Douglas for Wonder Boys was my clear choice for Best Actor. But after his non-nomination, I was firmly behind Tom Hanks making it three in a row. Do not watch this movie on a Saturday night with friends!! Watch it all alone and rejoice in the fact that we have an actor of Tom's calibre for our entertainment:-))

2 February 2001,What a movie,"I tell you they really know how to use special affects. Thats a good thing. This movie had me driving my fingernails into the seat at the theater. I was soo engulfed with emotion. Now that's how you know the movie is good. If it puts you in the say frame of mind as the main character, it's a knock out. I felt like I was stranded on that island too. But I do think that 4 years was a bit drastic and far fetched. Again Tom's will to live kept him alive. In most cases many people wouldn't have that strong of a will. I think this one's an Oscar contender from Go. Tom Hank's brilliant acting skills puts on the line, too. And at the end, you know how they feel when they meet after all that time. I can just imagine how hard it was to lose a love like that twice! An award should also go to Helen Hunt for her supporting role.

12 February 2001,Not enjoyable at all,"I had great expectations of ""Cast Away"", considering Tom Hanks is my favourite actor. I was very disappointed. I felt no emotion for any of the characters, least of all Chuck, even though Tom Hanks did do an excellent acting job and definitely deserved the Golden Globe. Also, the story line was way too jumpy. The best scene in the movie is the storm scene. That was the only part of the movie that had me fully interested in the fate of Chuck.

14 February 2002,good but something missing,"I liked this movie, but from start to finish, I kept feeling like something was missing. I think what it may have been was character development. I'm sure the director as well as the viewers wanted to get on with the main character getting deserted on the island but I think they hurried it a bit too much. The whole time that Chuck (I think that's right) is on the island, we see just how much he loves his wife Kelly but we can't really relate because we hardly know her. That's the way I felt anyway. And even Chuck, we don't really know him, we know that he takes his work very seriously and allows it to take time away from his wife but that's about it. I just didn't really feel I knew the characters. But the portion of the movie starting from the crash and the time he is on the island, I thought was very good. I know many people would have laughed at the idea of a grown man making friends with a volleyball but I think if anybody was alone on an island for 4 years, they might be desperate enough to form a close personal relationship with a volleyball. I might talk to an inanimate object after being left alone for a few hours but then again, I might be a little crazy... anyhow, overall, I liked the movie and I gave it an 8 but I thought it needed better character development. Tom Hanks did an excellent job but the lack of character development took away from his good performance I thought. Also, I thought it should have explained that ""special"" package a bit more. For some reason, this package meant a lot to Chuck. I chalked it up to, well he had an intuitive feeling but I thought maybe I was missing something.",8
4 September 2001,Great from beginning to end,"This was a great film. Ever since I heard of Survivor I was hoping a film like this would be made so I could really see how creative someone could be being lost on an uncharted island. The idea of Wilson the volleyball was also very creative. This is an excellent drama, and Tom Hanks played an extremely well-acted role. I know that I would never be up to gaining weight, then losing a lot (Tom Hanks did that in this film as well as ""Philadelphia"".) Cast Away is one of my favorite films, and it amazes me every time I watch it. It has a perfect setting, plot, and shows many different creative ways that an unexperienced man could survive on an island. ****1/2 out of *****.

14 July 2001,Don't Waste you time or money on this one.,"I thought this movie was going to be great... I was so very wrong. I was so bored. The others watching the movie with me wanted to turn it off at about the half way mark... I convinced them that if Tom Hanks was in it surely it would get better. Again I was wrong. I was so disappointed in this movie. Maybe Tom Hanks and the Produces/Directors of this movie are long time friends,,, maybe he owed them a favor, what ever it was the price was too high to pay. I will continue to enjoy Tom Hanks movies... after all it was not his acting I disliked but the story line. I know that if this movie is nominated for any award it will be because of the name Tom Hanks. One of the best movies, I think Tom Hanks did was Forrest Gump.. now that was very original and held my attention threw out the entire movie. I would not recommend anyone to see this movie. Unless you can see it for free and have nothing better to do for a couple of hours and even then watching re-run TV would be more interesting.

23 December 2000,Words cannot convey the greatness of this film.,"I knew from the very first preview I saw for this film that I was going to enjoy it. I just saw it tonight and I can't stop thinking about it. So how can I summarize this film in a matter that does not spoil it? I just don't think it can be spoiled... there is a lot to take in, and no one can explain it all to you.

I found that this movie brought me back to reality. There really is not anything you can simply point at and say ""that could never be because..."" to me Cast Away is almost like a documentary, except it's not boring and has good Actors in it. I am not even going to try to explain any of the plot of this film, just watch it for yourself.

Movie gets a 10 from me, hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

21 October 2002,A Normal Guy... A Stranded Guy... A Sad Guy,"This movie is one of the most saddest movies I have ever seen. The movie starts out with our lead actor Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a complicated Fed-Ex Manager (or someone who dictates to the Fed-Ex employees) who lives by the clock. His busy time dependent life suddenly comes crashing down with him in a plane being the lone survivor on an uninhabited island. Tom Hanks then gets to experience a new life where time has no influence. While on the island you get to slowly suffer with Tom Hanks as he tries to live on the island. When he finally makes a tough decision of leaving or staying on the island after four years, he chooses to leave the island in hope of getting back to a different world. After 4 miserable years Tom finally sets sail on a long little expedition on a tiny boat made out of trees and logs. He gets spotted by a ship and then gets brought back to his hometown of Tennesse. While on the island he wants nothing but to get back to his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt). When he gets back he learns his dentist, Dr. Spalding has married his wife and he has lost her all over again. At the end of the movie, he stand in the middle of a 4-way interesection puzzled on the next move he should make. This movie is sad but gives you a concept of a normal life turning sour, and never becoming good again.",
22 February 2020,God knows what made people so love this movie,"For the most part I felt what could be shown in two hours could be done in a matter of twenty minutes. Yes, I understand that it wouldn't create the same feeling but boredom killed me as I continued watching movie. What stopped me from leaving it was I was looking forward to a great ending. But that's me, that's how my taste works. I leave this with a 2/10.

25 March 2001,"A Story Of Loss, and Survival","This movie has been reviwed by many, and has taken some blows that do not do the story credit. This is not a story for those who've become accustomed to fast-paced action, although there are moments of that. This is the story of one who is forced to respond to events - survive - or perish. And given that it is the story of survival on an isolated South Pacific island, it has a pace that probably does not satisfy some.

It is a satisfying movie, however, for those that would give in to it. It is missing that last magical integration of elements that could elevate it to a classic, which it is not. It is, however, a wonderful story that leaves one with an overriding sense of loss, with just the element of hope and survival at the end that brings the loss into balance.

The cinematography has moments that are breathtaking, especially when the viewer is given the sense of isolation amidst the vastness of the ocean. For one who grew up in that Pacific, these moments were especially effective.

This movie may not be for everyone, but for those who are ready for something other than chocolate and vanilla, this may just hit the spot. I recommend it.",9

8 March 2004,Cast Away- Emotionally,"I believe the older a person is the better one is able to understand what Chuck Noland experienced on that island. One has to be beat up a little to gain life's true perspective. Watching the movie several times I still am moved by Hank's ability to bring out the sadness of his character's plight. At 66 years old I see things in the movie that move me to tears. About my third viewing I was moved by the scene of his getting over the wave. As he turns to start rowing he looks back toward the island. That look on his face shows such ambivalence. What he learned on that island has such a bittersweet after taste. This is so significant to Chuck that he turns Wilson around so he can take a look. Then the rain and fog come in to fade out the island. Great stuff! This is where also the theme music begins,it has been silent on the island. What a moving musical score. It comes in when there is emtional conflict in the remaining portion of the story.

23 May 2012,Tom Hanks Can Do No Wrong :),"Cast Away has a place in my top ten greatest movies of all time. Which includes ""Forrest Gump"", another Tom Hanks classic. Cast Away is perfect. Every actor/actress played their parts to perfection. I honestly can't pick out one flaw. This movie wasn't too long or too short. It was extremely entertaining and is guaranteed to have you guessing whats going to happen next; you'll be surprised more than once. Movies with predictable scenes can take away your interest in watching them, but this movie has a ton of scenes that you just won't see coming. It was a perfect balance of funny, thriller, drama and romance all put together. If you haven't seen this yet, you gotta pop some deliciously sweet kettle corn. Get yourself a crave case from White Castle. Pick your favorite beverage and get ready to sit back and witness one of the greatest movies you'll ever watch...

13 July 2005,"Good, but not as good as I thought it would be.","This film like a lot of films was hyped up and did not, in my opinion, live up to the hype. It was to me, very slow moving to him finally ""arriving"" on the island. The acting was good and the story was easily comprehensible, but overall, it is a better than average Tom Hanks movie. I think the FedEx scenes were long and drawn out and were not completely necessary to the plot. Tom Hanks talks to Volley ball(Wilson) on deserted, uncharted island!! That is the basic crux of the movie.

In other words, been there, done that(Well, maybe not a Volley ball)!! I think that Hanks saved this movie from being less than adequate. Helen Hunt was good, but there is not enough of her in the movie either.

4 January 2001,Great Movie but. . .,"It really seem like one big ad for Federal Express. I think it would have been better if there was a fake company Hanks' character worked for. (I guess the same would apply for the ball named Wilson) there is too much commercialization in American movies. So much so now that there is no need for ads in between breaks now. You see an actor drinking a Coke, calling someone on an Ericsson cell phone, driving a Pontiac Aztec.

That trend is taking away from the true art that was American film.

24 January 2008,review,"I have heard many people call this Fed-ex add, and i have to agree with them. It seen Fed-ex bosses abuse their workers,they have no lives, their jobs consume them, their family life suffers and even then the packages still go out late. Their planes aren't safe , their pilots are poor , and if they do 'loose' a package, they have no problem opening it to see if there is anything useful inside.

Very exciting start when the plane went down, laughable to find out that Tom Hanks was able to survive the crash from 25,000 feet. Anyone who works in shipping has to wonder why a package being delivered to Texas would have ever been on a Fed-ex plane going over the South Pacific. It wasn't logical.

Last of all,i couls not accept the fact that his girlfriend could turn her back on ""the love of her life"" only one year after he disappeared and married someone else.It actually made me quite angry at the end",2
8 May 2001,Simply beautiful cinema,"There is little doubt in my mind that people would just rag on this movie. However, Bob Zemeckis's film-making talent just got even better, and he didn't need his usual plethora of special effects to depict the movie. (He in fact used them, but much more subtlely)

The beauty of this movie is the ending. I real life, it could only end this way and it was film making magic. One thing comes to mind--the winged logo that kept Hank's character going throughout his trials and trevails. (there were lots of things that madfe him keep going, Wilson, a picture of Helen Hunt, etc.) Little did he know, even in search of the packages rightful receipient that another life far removed from the one with Helen Hunt or alone on the island was on the horizon. It's depicts fate, the human heart, and more then anything, hope.

Tom Hanks once again has turned in a performance of a lifetime and while many will feel that he lost out to a Richard Burton's ghost-like performance by Russell Crowe, this years awards which was severely criticized beforehand for the lack of quality, It sure produced some great and epic movies. Gladiator, Traffic, and Castaway not withstanding.

As a movie enthusiast, I can only look even more forward to the future. We have now entered into a Golden Age of Film that may be looked on in years forthcoming as monumental. Certainly Castaway has helped in this cause.",9
9 January 2013,true grit comes through,"from the very first scenes of the plane in a crash dive, robert zemeckis has once again proved what a great director he was. and probably the only one who could pull you through this drama is someone of tom hanks' capacity. once again, hanks' versatility as an actor has shown through as one thinks along with him as to the next important thing to do--one almost becomes hanks' character himself. on the astute recommendation of a friend, i picked this one to see--don't know how i missed it back then--and she was right. this is engrossing to the hilt and uncompromising in its ability to pull you in. if you haven't already seen it, go out and rent it today, or if you've seen it already, do it again. it's certainly worth the 2 hrs. and 23 mins worth!!!

18 January 2001,Excellent movie with BIG flaws,"This is an entertaining and visually stunning movie that has something terribly wrong with it. That something is inconsistency. I think both writer and director contributed to the good and the bad. Again and again, ideas of pure genius are mixed with unlikely  even irrational  points that are impossible to accept. For starters: could a Caucasian spend 4 years in the blazing sun of a tropical island and come away with crusted lips and no trace of sunburn? Not even a tan? Tom Hanks is good and likeable, as always. But he carries the picture only in the sense that for much of it no one else is onscreen. Although his role calls for him to do lots of unusual things, they're really script stunts, not acting. He needs that talent only sporadically. For me, the film's 3 big plusses are the plane crash, the photography and the story's conclusion. The crash at sea is seen wholly from inside the craft, from the passengers' point of view. (It's reminiscent of Hitchcock's masterful clipper crash in `Foreign Correspondent' 60 years earlier.) The photography by Don Burgess keeps us in precisely the right place every second. His camera is often at water level yet  thanks to digital work, I assume  there's never a drop on the lens. The movie ends in an ideal location and on a perfect note of indecision and nearly limitless possibilities. Among the film's best bits is Wilson, Tom's volley ball companion, whose loss is heartbreaking. For a good and skillful movie, however, far too many questions remain. The island's beach is littered with FedEx packages from the plane's cargo, yet it seems days before Tom even thinks to look in them for useful items. Why? (Eventually, nearly everything proves to be valuable.) He also takes too long to secure the inflatable life raft that got him from the crash site to the island. And once that's lost in an unsuccessful attempt to get away, ages pass before he even thinks of trying to BUILD some sort of escape craft. I just don't believe it. Among the dumber script flaws is Tom's toothache. With all the genuine crises facing a castaway, this affliction seems contrived and superfluous. But despite the irritating lapses in `Cast Away,' the splendid good points outweigh the clumsy ones, and best parts are unforgettable. 8 stars out of 10.",

5 February 2001,Tripe,"Zemeckis and Hanks sure know their audience as this movie has pulled in a gross totally out of proportion to the films quality. I am just glad that I saw it for free and didn't contribute my $9.50.

As many other reviews here state the cheesy ending when he finally returns to Memphis (some four weeks after he was rescued) spoiled even further an already mediocre film.

For those of you who want to see a film that accurately portrays life as a cast away then rent ""Castaway"" (1987) starring Amanda Donohoe and the late Oliver Reed. That film may not be the greatest but provides a more realistic portrayal of life on an island and may help you fill in the gaps in what Hanks may have gone through during those ""missing"" four years.

26 December 2000,Tom Hanks Does It Again....,"Great movie. Even though it will become a commercial success, Cast Away, has this understated edginess to it. It's by far the most captivating performance by Hanks since his Oscar winning turn in Philadelphia. He is by far, one of the best actors alive.

This movie has everything: Slapstick comedy, drama, action, oh, and did I forget to mention Tom Hanks? He does a terrific job of making the audience feel what he feels. I felt like I was on that island with him. And then when 4 years had passed and I saw his frail body on the screen, my heart ached. Never in my entire movie going experience had I empathized with a character so much. You know you're watching a terrific artist when they say and do very little and still seem to ignite the screen. His subtlety was brillant and so was the film.

28 December 2000,"Good movie, great acting, good story.","Tom Hanks, what can I say? He's great as always. Filming was very good, special effects were nearly flawless. Not sure I buy the jet engine chasing him through the water long after the crash and the front half of the plane has already sank. Story makes one think what they might do and if they could survive under similar circumstances. Can see awards coming for Best Picture, Best Actor (Hanks) and maybe Best Cinematography. The story did good not to give in the temptation do a cheery ending but provided a very believable ending. Gave it a 7.

6 January 2004,Stands the test of time...,"Upon my second viewing of Cast Away on television I became sad... sad

because I had forgotten what an outstanding movie it truly is. To me, it's one of those films that can easily stand the test of time and no matter how many times you see it, it's STILL that good. Zemeckis is one of my favorite directors and just does an amazing job of using not only Tom Hanks, but the surrounding

environment, appropriate timing on music (and lack of), and overall camera

work to make you feel everything Chuck Noland does. And ultimately, that's

EXACTLY what a director should do. It's very well done.

4 March 2001,Cast Away over rated,"I heard many great things about Hank's performance in this movie. When I watched it, I couldn't help but turn my head at times, not because of grotesque scenes or scenes that were too real. Instead, there were scenes of Hanks getting down on his belly and melodramatically licking water droplets. Come on! Also, the scene where he 4 years later, can harpoon a fish from 20 plus feed out. The camera pans up to him standing there..all stoic..nonesense. I realize that some of this is the directors fault, letting Hanks go too far with some of this stuff. But for the people tauting this as ""Hanks for Oscar"" etc. ..no way. Also, the last 3rd of the movie lagged and could have editted to half. Not a great film: too long and too many melodramatic scenes. Also, the whale scene was so fake I couldn't take it. With all the modern technology these days, that scene was pathetic. As for the product placement, I didn't find it distracting as it was part of the story, fortunately or not.

13 August 2001,Immensely Thought-Provoking,"Cast Away is one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen in a long time. It follows the events before, during, and after Fed-Ex employee Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks, in an outstanding performance) becomes stranded on a deserted island. Things are pretty dull until his plane inevitably crashes, when things become truly compelling. Hanks portrayal of Noland on the island is brilliant, capturing the terror and hopelessness that must be going through Noland's mind.

The moments on the island are truly great for several reasons. Most of our emotion comes from what we see rather than what we hear; Zemerickis wisely halts the score and lets us feel like we are helplessly deserted on a quiet island, completely isolated from the sounds of every day life, such as people talking, car doors slamming, phones ringing, and clocks ticking. This is a brilliant character study of what Noland does to keep himself alive, physically and psychologically.

When the island tidbits are over and Chuck returns home, things continue to mind boggle. How would people react if we unexpectedly returned four years later after being considered dead? What kind of position does this put Noland's fiance in? Although many of the details of Noland's life after the island are completely off and more crowd-pleasing, it is still compelling. Wouldn't Chuck be psychologically ruined after four years of human isolation?

The film is terrific until the last few scenes, which ruin the overall impact. Zemerickis tries to put together several painfully obviously hints at Chuck's future. The last shot alone, with Chuck looking at the ""crossroads"" and smiling at the camera is absolutely absymal. It is a terrible way to end what was a powerful and serious film, with a stupid little crowd-pleasing ""things are looking up"" conclusion tacked on.

The ending can be forgiven, and there is still no doubt that the island scenes are immensely powerful. They alone make this film one of the best of the year, and they make it well worth watching, if only to challenge us and make us think.

17 October 2016,A 10 out of 10 Movie,"This is the most favorite movie of mine. You are bound to enjoy the full movie. It starts slowly and after around 10-15 minutes the non stop thrilling begins which will keep you glued to the movie till the end. The way Tom Hanks tries to survive and inspire himself is really amazing. A must watch movie for all kinds of movie lovers. We all try our best to survive; this movie reflects that effort perfectly. Even a simple volley ball ""Wilson"" becomes a good companion of Tom in the lonely island. ""Cast Away"" does not show any magical or absurd tricks to survive that is why it appeals more to the viewers. You may feel yourself trapped in the island while watching this movie as the movie is so engaging. You may have watched ""Life of Pie"" but this one is way better than that.

19 January 2005,Incredibly interesting.,"Robert Zemekis and Tom Hanks pull off this magnificent film seemingly without much effort. The movie stars really one man, and takes place really on one island. So what makes it so good? For starters, this movie is very original. At first, who wants to see a movie about a guy stuck on an island? No one. BUT then you ask... who wants to see a movie about a man who struggles against his environment forces to make friends with a volleyball and desperate to escape to see his long lost wife after five years... well everyone! Tom Hanks should have been at least up for an Oscar for this performance. It was truly remarkable. Not only was this movie very good, but it was also popular. Wilson volleyballs will never seem the same after watching this movie. :)

25 December 2000,Hanks needs better material,"Tom Hanks is fine in Cast Away. It's too bad the script is another of Zemeckis's uplifting pieces of puffery.

Hanks does a fine job in the center of the film, the portion devoted to his stranding on an island, with little hope of return to civilization. Here the character is well drawn and his strength of determination is admirable. It is when he is rescued that the film falls apart. Instead of all the product pushing of Fed-Ex and his evident affection for those responsible for the loss of a large chunk of his life, it would be a great deal more satisfying to see him getting a high powered lawyer to sue the blazes out of them. It is time for Hanks to stop being likeable and take the role of a thoroughly despicable character. He runs the risk of continuing to be the Jimmy Stewart of this generation. One of those was enough. No more treacle!

23 December 2000,Damned Good !,"Well, after seeing his latest film, I feel that I can forgive Robert Zemeckis for his lame-ass Summer film (and inexplicably, a HIT) that aped Hitchcock in the worst way(s) ""What Lies Beneath"".

That film was made while production was shut down on ""Cast Away"", so that star Tom Hanks could recuperate.

Its about time that Hanks was declared the modern day Gary Cooper, and/or James Stewart, as he is just so memorable in everything that he does, and nobody plays the ""common man"" as well as he does.

The trick is, all his ""common man"" characters are so wonderfully complicated and fascinating to watch.

Despite that, Hanks always brings something different to each role, and, in ""Cast Away"" as the taskmaster ""Fed Ex"" dude ""Chuck Noland"", he invests the character with strength, pathos, and, early on, a bit of surly attitude (he seems a bit nasty barking out orders to the confused Russian ""Fed Exers"" at the start), but ultimatley, ""Noland"" is a man that we care about, and we want to see him LIVE and return to his beloved, played by an unusually restrained Helen Hunt.

I enjoyed the bejeebers out of ""Cast Away"", and I recommend that you rush out and see this right after you get done digesting your thirtieth dry turkey sandwich (its a Christmas release, natch), and I guarantee that the tryptophonic effects of the bird will have no effect on you as you watch Hanks offer up an acting tour-de-force.

Note to Robert Zemeckis: all is forgiven for ""What Lies Beneath"" :-)",
28 December 2000,The different views.,"I'm sick and tired of seeing reviews written the same way. So for this gem, I'll try a new approach.

1) The Intellectual ME: Enormously satisfying. Great movies have many underlying messages, and this flik a had a plethora. Made me wonder how important the man made stuff is (ie. like the computer I am typing on right now)

2) The Immature ME: Wow! What a plane crash that was!! I bet this is one of those movies that won't be shown on an airplane!

3) The Horny ME: The lady at ""Bettina's"" was hotter than an egg on Route 48 in Texas (and in July). I was teased to see that Hollywood had Helen Hunt running in a white blouse during a rain shower. Unfortunately, I did not see any flesh beneath it.

4) The What-If ME: Made me marvel at how much skill and luck Noland actually had. Would I have been able to start a fire?

and finally...

5) The Critic ME: This was hands down the best movie of the year I have seen thus far. It is not the best movie of all time, but it may crack the top 250. Tom Hanks is incredible, however, the same credit should be given to whoever is responsible for selecting his movies. The screen play was top-notch.

Any movie that makes forces you to draw upon your own reflection, is a worthy movie. Cast Away reaches out to its audience like an older brother trying to save you from a bad accident, and when it grabs you it teaches you a lot of good things. Should be a multiple Oscar contender.",10
7 February 2001,"Engaging Thriller, without a Villain","I finally saw Castaway, and thought it was an absorbing drama of human resourcefulness. I resisted seeing it for fear that the time spent by the Tom Hanks character in isolation marooned on an island would be boring. It wasn't. The cinematography is great ... beautiful sunsets and skylines, crashing waves and natural beauty. The endurance skills he develops are admirable, as are the ways he tackles small crises and shares his thoughts with us. His survival episodes engage us, including building a fire, searching for water and food, communicating for help, fighting the elements, looking for life on the island, attending to his wounds, simulating a human companion, and maintaining his sanity. His appearance after an extended period, with a full beard and loincloth, make him look like a genuine prehistoric man. The film's strength is how Tom Hanks makes it all believable. It would be hard for a lesser actor to pull it off.

Adding to the movie's appeal is the simplicity of the story. It's man versus nature for survival; what could be simpler? An auxiliary but equally straightforward plot is his courtship with Helen Hunt. There are no complex motives to decipher, nor cruelty or violence. We can all safely root for Hanks as he battles his loneliness, his environment, and his separation from his fiancée. It can roughly be compared to Jaws, with the non-human `enemy' changed from a whale to the forces of nature.

The air crash that leads to his ordeal is magnificently dramatized, but is not for the faint of heart. Those with a fear of flying may not want to see it, although the plane itself is not a commercial airliner. Even his romance with Helen Hunt, dismissed as contrived by some, rang true for me. That may be because attractions between people around 40 are rarely shown in films, and are seldom resolved as depicted here. The publicity for FedEx in the film is extensive and positive, and probably merited. I certainly recommend this movie.",
28 January 2001,"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT MOVIE!","This was a great, fascinating , and yes, even brilliant. What is wrong with these people on this website that say it's so terrible? Yall' are mad! This could almost be the greatest movie of this year. I recommend all the people who haven't seen Cast Away, to ignore all the bad things that have been said about it, and go see it NOW! I give it 10/10.

5 June 2023,great acting from Ton Hank,"I almost skipped the first 30 mins, it has nothing to do with the island.

Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film. I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing. The story is so well written in its simplicity, and Helen Hunt and Hanks have an amazing chemistry. It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together. I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile!

It is so well directed, with an absolutely stunning performance by Tom Hanks that you are going to remember it forever! It is very positive that it starts by building some story, creating some romance and then it becomes survival, emotional and dramatic! Some scenes are classic, a true piece of art! Ending could go to 2 directions but the writer wasn't too greedy and he made the reasonable , logical decision, that tells a lot about this love story! That was good too!",8
9 April 2003,"Not Zemeckis's best, but far from Hanks' worst.","A modernization of Robinson Carusoe starring Tom Hanks could've been waaay better. The conversation with the volleyball was pushing it a bit too far. So was the product placement from Federal Express. Zemeckis has been known to put lots of product placement in his movies (Back to the Future was filled with it, but it was done in a way that didn't get annoying) but this movie overdid it. The whole movie basically jumped up and down and screamed ""Give me an oscar!"" Robert Zemeckis has done much better (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump) but Tom Hanks has done much worse (You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle) Rent it, but don't buy it.

5 November 2015,Awesome!!,"If you are feeling lonely and nothing is working for you. This is the movie you should watch. This movie will motivate you not to quit, keep patience and focus on your work, whatever the situation. Directed and produced by Robert Zemeckis, ""Cast Away"" is an American adventure drama film released in 2000. This is a great movie in which Tom Hanks (Chuck Noland) a FedEx employee stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes in the South Pacific. In the film, Wilson the volleyball serves as Chuck Noland's personified friend and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted island. He learns to survive and doesn't loose hope. He stayed alive even there was no reason of hope as he believed that the sun will rise tomorrow. Who knows what the tide could bring?

17 September 2023,A classic dashed with Hank sauce,"From the beautifully shot crash, to the final escape, it's hard to bring up survival media without being reminded of this movie. Is it perfect? Well that's a matter of preference. It falls to an eight for me simply due to the blasé drama and romance typical of movies from this period and of Tom Hanks.

He is an exceptional actor, and the advent of Wilson was iconic, providing some much needed humanity (ironically) and dry comedic relief. These are the strengths of this movie, and have cemented it as a classic.

There's a lot you can do with this setting, and the time span of 4 years. In fact, a lot more would happen than what's even shown, assuming he wouldn't have developed an infection in his leg from that under-emphasized major injury. He does no base-building, and is even depicted sleeping on a rock, which is uncharacteristic of men. Since the movie is somewhat based on reality, these are weaknesses.

To be frank, the beginning was boring for me, and the ending too ""bittersweet"", leaving me with a feeling of emptiness. This is something I'm not a fan of, and I'm assuming others given the rating. But I understand that this is also less common in cinema, and was built to add meaning.

Yet with the level of cinematography, acting, etc. As well as a favorable setting, it is hard to go wrong. And, of course, Wilson. So it has earned its place, to say the least.",8

29 December 2000,"Well, Hanks is good.","There are movies that are part very good but in the whole unsatisfying. This is one. The plane crash and struggle to the island are well shot. Hanks is great in his struggle to survive on the island both physically and mentally. Wilson as a companion and primitive god is a good device. Unfortunately the love story that surrounds the action in the movie's construction is too thin and doomed from the outset to eliminate any reasonably ""happy"" or meaningful conclusion. Two people pretty well absorbed by their respective careers, Hanks a Fedex exec and Hunt working on a PhD, cannot quite find time or the full commitment to formalize their relation. A dramatic accident that creates the action and one person show for Hanks. Finally, rescue after 4 years and confrontation with Hunt who has moved on. Hunt however does deliver both a ""you are the love of my life"" speech and a ""I had a really hard time after you were lost"" line. Please. How could Hanks have a meaningful relationship with Hunt if she honestly believed that her hard times had any comparative aspect to being lost on an island for 4 years of near Hellish suffering? Who can believe that Hanks would want or expect Hunt to leave a husband(why cast ""Big"" from Sex in the City?) and child? The three items that kept Hanks going were Wilson ( a mixture of god and inner values), the package ( a commitment) and the picture of Hunt (love interest). In the end he's left Hunt, delivered the package and lost Wilson. Yes he can wander any of the roads open to him as in a new life. No, it doesn't make sense or pull the movie together.",7
24 July 2016,My favorite film of all-time!,"This is definitely one of my favorite films, if not my favorite film of all time! It is really, really underrated! There are so many great things about this movie that I can't possibly explain everything, but I will explain some things on why I love it so much. First, lets start with the acting. Tom Hanks delivers an outstanding performance! Never once is he monotonous or boring. You actually feel his emotion and it is just him on the island. The acting just has so much raw power, it is insane. Also, you better like Tom Hanks, since it is just him on the island, or you probably won't like this movie (but then again, who doesn't like Tom Hanks?) Now, I want to talk about the plot. I'm not going to reveal every detail or anything, but I just want to say that I like survival stories, and this is no exception. There is also a romance aspect to this film that I love, and also like how it isn't just straight-up romance, but it is subtle almost. Also, Robert Zemeckis directed this really well. Also, how is there so much emotion in this film? I felt sad and also started developing feelings for the characters, like Wilson and Chuck. Finally, I want to talk about the amazing cinematography. The amazing camera shots that they use are some of the best that I have ever seen. Also, the island allows for some good cinematography. Beautiful blues, lush greens, bright yellows (from the raft) makes for one of the best color palettes I have seen to date. Really, the cinematography is just breathtaking. Just such great scenery makes this a movie to see on Blu-Ray. No color grading present, just beautiful natural colors. Also, I mentioned camera shots. They really are some of the greatest shots that I have seen. Basically, just watch this movie. You will NOT be disappointed. One of the greatest films of all time and so incredibly underrated.",10
24 December 2000,An amazing experience.,"The best way to describe ""Cast Away"" is that it isn't a movie, it's an experience. It seems like so much more than just a movie, it is almost like you are living on the island with Tom Hanks. For the duration of the film I found myself totally lost in it. I was also a cast away.

There are a few films which are able to have just one brilliant moment in the whole picture. ""Cast Away"" contains several, if not the entire movie itself. The plane crash is one of the most intense scenes in recent memory, and rivals anything in ""The Perfect Storm."" The scenes where Chuck (Hanks) is trying to make a fire have a desperation and perseverance that accompany them. The raft scenes are also outstanding and incredibly suspenseful.

The best part of ""Cast Away"" is no doubt Tom Hanks. I have never seen an actor carry a film on his shoulders like Hanks does. The majority of the film is Hanks, and only Hanks. It takes an amazing performance to pull something like that off, and he delivers. His emotional state throughout his time on the island changes, and he doesn't have to say anything. It's all in the eyes and the body language. Tom Hanks may not beat Russell Crowe for best actor, but a nomination is assured.

The mastermind behind ""Cast Away"" is none other than Robert Zemeckis. He directs with patience and maturity. He allows Hanks the breathing room to make the tedious island scenes work. I have not seen editing this effective since ""JFK."" He delivers a movie with a lot of suspense and drama. The film's end is one of the best I've ever seen, and really is appropriate.

Go to the theater and experience ""Cast Away."" Remember to bring your beach towel and sun block.",10

23 November 2016,Gem of a Movie,"I had great expectations from the movie. And it didn't disappoint. Tom Hanks is way too good. This is one great movie which certainly goes much deeper than the portrayal. Nature, mortality, necessities of life, passion, never give up determination, love, humour, ET AL. You name it. This one here has everything in it. And a splendid display of them all. This goes to the topmost shelf of my mind and the most decorated cabinet in my heart. I am watching this many a time. Excellent. I am sure there's a lot in the audience who bought the DVD just in order to watch it over and over again. Well that's quite natural. You are in for a very nice experience. People having complaints about their situation. Just sit and admire this. There's a lot of help on offer.

15 January 2001,"A boring, stupid movie","""Cast Away"" is not a good movie for numerous reasons, not the least of which is that for an hour of screentime the only conflict is Tom Hanks' toothache. Very simply, nothing happens on the island except some ridiculously silly bits of expository dialogue between Hanks and a volleyball: ""What's that, Wilson? Why am I sad? It's because...."" Stupid, awful screenwriting plagues the movie, from bad dialogue to equally ridiculous coincidences-- good thing that FedEx package contains something that Hanks can use as an axe!

Hanks is a fine naturalistic actor in the style of Spencer Tracy, and is always fun to watch, but ""Cast Away"" is boring: the only scenes of poignancy and impact are those that aren't set on the island.

Wait for the video. Better still, watch Nicolas Roeg's ""Castaway""-- it's a far superior movie.",3
18 December 2016,Great movie,"Wow! WHAT A GREAT MOVIE! The transformation of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is unbelievable. He lost a lot of weight and grew a beard for the movie. He was such a great actor and now I am going to watch all of his movies. Wilson the ball was really hilarious at first but I can see the reason why he needed that ball as a friend. The ball acted as his only sense of relief and without it, Chuck would have been really depressed. However, when the ball floated away, you can see the desperation in his eye as he had the face the decision to save his friend, Wilson, or hold onto the raft that will bring him back to the society and home. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family.

Cast Away is not without one, fairly large, problem. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. The details you don't see, with an exception or two, are minor and, I won't spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, not much missed.

Still, I recommend it. It's FAR better than lots of the stuff they give us these days.

23 May 2023,Such a Great One,"The perfect Everyman actor, Tom Hanks does it yet again in Cast Away. If it weren't for Maximus Decimus Meridius in Gladiator, he'd have nabbed a third Oscar. A movie like this could've been soo boring without the right interpretation of the material. I mean, it's a guy Mario ed on an island by himself for two hours. Not too much in the way of plot or dialogue there. But Tom Hanks makes you empathize and feel what he feels the entire way. But the best part of this film is the love story. He could/should have given up at so many junctures, but getting back to his person was what drove him to simply survive and keep trying. Definitely check out this movie. It's an all-time great.

15 December 2006,Fantastic Metaphor for Divorce,"On the surface this movie appears to be another ""stranded on an island"" story, however it's a very deep metaphoric exploration of a man's experience of going through a divorce.

The acting, pacing and audio are sensational. Great work by all involved with the silver lining that life does go on and you can find love again.

Hanks at his absolute best, and perhaps more deserving of a best actor award than any of his prior performances. Hopefully over time this movie will garner the staying power and recognition that it truly deserves.

28 December 2000,"Good, except for the publicity","== this is meant for people who saw the movie = Overall, I would say I enjoyed this movie. It's been a while since a 2h30 film didn't seem long and I didn't complain about the chair.. since The Green Mile actually, but that's another story.

It's a good movie, but yes, it could have been better. Before I went to see this movie, I was pretty sure it would be a movie to make money out of the ""Survivor"" wave, but it's a little different than I tought. But I would have liked to see more of the life on the island instead of the beginning and the end.. his suicide attempt for instance, and more... That movie should have been 3 hours, it would have been worth it.

Many people didn't see the package on the raft, well, look again, it's used as a pillow and with a lot of videotape around it, it's there all the way...

But again, why didn't he open it? That's another part of the very annoying publicity in this movie, the reason why this package saved his life is because it gave him a REASON to live.. this package and his fiancee, he kept this package because he wanted to deliver it, and the photo of his fiancee also. I don't see another reason.

But again, I was a little sick of seeing overuse of publicity in this movie.. FedEx, Dr Pepper, Wilson, come on.. we are paying to go see those movies, cut the prices if you want to add publicity in the movie, this way we'll agree. This is enough to keep me using UPS as a courier service...!

Seriously, I found that part of the movie very annoying.. having a fake company would've been better.

But besides that, that was a good movie, but I would have liked to see more from it.. I found it too short, even for a 2h30 movie...

My 2 cents, enjoy!",8
9 February 2010,Tom Hanks refreshingly out of his comfort zone,"This movie is a refreshing and successful representation of isolated life and survival. Well written, and directed exceptionally. The basic concept lack originality, but the depiction accounted for it. Emotionally it depicts struggle, love, and underlying depressing themes with a splash of comedy at the beginning to lighten the feel a little (well chosen, otherwise one of the main themes may have been depression). As for the acting, Hanks is brilliant and clearly breaks free of his stereotypical extroverted, anxious character. Very good emotional depiction considering the fact that for long stretches in the movie he has no lines to work with whatsoever. Hunt is good but a little disappointing in comparison to her in As Good as it Gets. Overall a very good movie, and an exceptional piece of Hanks.

** ½ Out of ****



Reviewed by Matt Doolittle



This is a movie about Chuck Nolan or was it Jack I don't know because different people call him different names. At one point he is Jack and the next he is Chuck. Anyway he is married to his job and is about to get married to his girlfriend. He is then called to South America for his job. He gets on a plane and later the plane crashes in the Pacific Ocean. He is the only survivor and he floats on a raft until he finds an island. The island has nothing on it except for the FED X packages from his plane. He later opens them only to find a pair of ice skates, a volleyball and some other seemingly useless items. He lives on the island for 5 years and goes somewhat insane until he figures out a way to get off. By this time the volleyball is his best friend named Wilson and they talk to each other all of the time. He makes it back to his home and he finds out that every one thinks he is dead. Actually they have already had a funeral for him and everything, so he then has to decide how to start his life over.

Although a funny movie it is pretty pointless. The plane crash is no big surprise because he says goodbye so many times that you know something is going to go wrong. Also there is no chemistry between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt, so their relationship is pretty unbelievable. The volleyball is an attempt to be funny but just gets annoying after a while. Over the period of Tom Hanks' stay on the island he seems pretty crazy but yet he knows exactly what day it is and he practically does Calculus in his head to achieve his plan to get off the island.

Tom Hanks does a good job with his role, but I was a little disappointed with Helen Hunt's character. Although she does a good job with it, there is not much she can do. She is supposed to be a main character, yet she has about 10 lines in the whole movie. This movie is not horrible but is not great either, but if you are one of those people who like happy medians, this is your show.",
12 April 2001,A much used plotline doesnt diminish this film's power....,"Rating: ***1/2 (out of 4)

Review: When I first heard the plot outline for CAST AWAY, I was praying to God that Hollywood wasn't going to go back to Gilligan's Island territory and use a much-respected actor (Tom Hanks) as a way to make viewers not realize their the plot had absolutely no originality (which about 60% of all Hollywood films are currently...and increasing every year!). However, thanks to a perceptive screenplay by William Broyles, Jr., this film practically made me disappointed with myself for making those assumptions. Even worse, it wasn't until I saw Hanks on the THE TONIGHT SHOW a few months later and explaining that his inspiration for CAST AWAY came when he viewed a documentary on the life and disappearance of Amelia Earhart, as well as the startling theory that she may have lived another 50 years on a deserted island after being discovered missing. On that note, there will most likely not be another time I will misjudge Hollywood for what I hear before I actually buy my ticket and popcorn and watch the movie and not putting my opinions down on paper before I actually watch the final frame. Director Robert Zemeckis (who helmed the much-loved favorites BACK TO THE FUTURE, CONTACT and WHAT LIES BENEATH) teams with Hanks for the very first time to tell the story of a FEDEX employee who finds himself washed ashore on a Pacific island after a frightening plane crash. It's now Man vs. Nature as Hanks collects small amounts of water from coconuts and rain, builds a fire to cook crab, make attempts let people know he is there and be rescued, and even creating a companion to talk to---a Wilson volleyball! I will not divulge what happens to Hanks eventually, for the purpose that this film develops an emotional intensity during the final half four.

Just as it sounds this is Tom Hanks' show all the way; the two-time Academy Award winner has been giving outstanding trademark performances all throughout his career, from playing a 12-year-old trapped inside the body of a 30-year-old (BIG), to a homosexual battling AIDS (PHILADELPHIA), and finally to a sweet simpleton who only is only barely aware of his surroundings and the people in this life (FORREST GUMP). In CAST AWAY, Hanks makes his character someone to actually care about, which is one of the most important elements in any good performance; he makes his lost FEDEX worker convincingly go through different emotional phases which results in a strong development in the character. Academy-Award winner Helen Hunt (AS GOOD AS IT GETS) plays the woman he loves with earnestness and compassion. Still, the one ""character"" that practically steals the film is Wilson, the volleyball who Hanks creates as a friend in order escape insanity, and as a lesser reason to have something---if not someone---to talk to; Wilson's final sequence is truly moving and unforgettable. In more ways than one, CAST AWAY surprised me and I loved it from beginning to end; if anything, I truly believe that with any other actor besides Hanks the character would be dull and the viewer wouldn't get involved. The film also boasts a fine score by Alan Silvestri (a regular on many Zemeckis films), as well as gorgeous photography and, finally, William Broyles, Jr's wonderful script, which managed to dodge cliches and make the film overall seem new and fresh. For that reason, I know that next time I go see a film a famliar story, that I will not print a word until the theater's lights illuminate once again.",
13 July 2020,What a masterpiece,"After the crash of Chuck Nuland, a systems engineer working for FedEx, in the Pacific Ocean, he finds himself struggling to survive on a deserted island.

A very beautiful drama film, one of the greatest survivors and survival films .. The film is full of influential scenes and valuable lessons.

One of Tom Hanks greatest films, if not the greatest, Hanks carried the entire film on his shoulders with the performance of the least said that he is great .. The actor is great in that he lost at least 15 kg because the viewer lives the suffering that the character is going through .. despite my love Serious to Russell Crowe, but I see that in 2000 Oscar was the best lead actor who was supposed to be going to Tom.

And do not forget the great director Robert Zemex, who knew how to leave the viewer center for two and a quarter hours in one place and with only one character without any boredom.

10/10 💙👏🏻.",10
5 January 2001,"Like drinking a warm, flat soft drink.","This film is just like that. It is good if your desperate, and it doesn't contain anything awful, but you could have better and it leaves you unsatisfied and you wouldn't want to have it again.

I liked Tom Hanks in this, but would just as well see him in something like Apollo 13 or Forest Gump. There were a few creative and entertaining elements here and there, but the ending was bad.

So his girlfriend got with some other guy and married him. Big deal. He was gone for 4 years, did he just expect her to wait by the phone for all that time?

In closing, you'll probably see the film, but don't make the mistake that I did: going in with high expectations!!!

Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball).

1 June 2005,The best movie since The Green Mile,"Tom Hanks gives an Oscar@ winning performance as Chuck Noland, a man who lands on an island after a plane crash. The movie is very realistic to show us what it must be like if you land on a island. What Noland did to survive was tremendous and very sad. The film's supporting actress is Helen Hunt, Noland's girlfriend. The film is enthusiastic and is never a dull moment with superb Hanks as the lead role.The Green Mile which was also very sad. Helen Hunt is extremely excellent as Noland's girlfriend. This is a movie to remember with Tom Hanks in. The best Tom Hanks movie since the 1999 Stephen King movie, The Green Mile which was the saddest movie of that year

2 September 2002,Hollywood at its best,"Although much has been made of the numerous references to Fed Ex, I think that the logos were a really not very significant, and just a distraction for those who had trouble appreciating and understanding this wonderful film. With few words and against a backdrop both beautiful and hauntingly sad, we watch as tom hanks is forced to learn how to survive, and rebuild his emotional core. The scene where the volleyball drifts away is just incredible. This is a masterpiece. It's strong stuff wrapped in mainstream hollywood cliches and performed by the most generic of cast members. I generally boycott films starring tom hanks, tom cruise, brad pitt, and others of their ilk but I'm glad I made an exception for this.

17 February 2001,Hanks Does it Again,"Just when you think Tom Hanks can't impress you, he does it again. I'll give equal praise to the director and the writer, but it's Hanks that makes this film. It's a two hour plus film, but for 90 minutes it's only him on screen, carrying the film unlike any actor I've ever seen do. Sure there are movies when the lead actor is in every scene, but Hanks takes it a step further and goes it alone most of the time. And the director used very little music in the scenes, so it's all on Tom's shoulders to make you feel all the pain that the character is going through.

It's a great film and Hanks proves he's still at the top of his game.

8 January 2019,Solid,"I didn't like the time jump in the middle of the film, and I think it was pretty obvious the scenes after he got back from the island were shot before some of the ones on there, and at the beginning the camera angle on the parcel was terrible, but I enjoyed 90% of this movie and it's definitely a must watch if you're looking for something to do. The acting is spot on for the most part and the film really makes you think about the gap in time. By the time Chuck is stranded on the island is a perfect change of pace and by the time he gets back is a welcome change in pace. Solid 8/10 (I feel 2012's 'Arrow' references this film way too much)

1 May 2001,little dialogue goes a long way,"This film impressed me because of its long stretches without dialogue. To me that is the height of great movie-making and reminds me of 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY in that regard. The movie is not a pleasant one emotionally. There are many instances of loss and survival. I wish that Zemeckis had spent more time on the protagonist's readjustment to American society.

4 April 2001,Amazing Depth,"If Russell Crow weren't so darn good in Gladiator Tom Hanks would be a three time Academy Award winner. The performance he tendered in Cast Away was honestly better than the two that won him Oscars, especially when one considers his co-star for the majority of the film was a piece of sporting equipment. This film amazed me from beginning to end. For a couple of hours I because Chuck Noland. What more could I ask from a movie? I liked this film more than most of my friends, and I can certainly understand why it just wouldn't click with some people. Cast Away is deeply psychological and personal, and it makes the viewer think as much about his or her own life as about the story line. It is ultimately a story of hope and perseverance, not of one man but of the human race. Now that it has left theaters I suggest watching this movie alone and free from distractions. I hope it speaks to you the way it spoke to me.

14 December 2000,This movie will leave you wondering why...,"As always, Tom Hanks gives us a wonderful performance. It's really easy to enjoy spending time with him alone on an island talking to a volley ball, but I don't know what they were thinking with the book ends they stuck on the movie.

I guess it comes back to my lack of enthusiasm for Helen Hunt (she plays Hanks' love interest in the movie)... or maybe just that things happen kind of fast. First we're in Russia and we see that Hanks is an enthusiastic Fedex employee. Then he's home for Christmas, then he's on a plane, then he crashes, then it's four years later, he escapes the island and next thing you know he's sitting on a plane going home to Memphis. And what's the point of making him grow that awesome beard when he shaves it off as soon as he gets back to the motherland?

I will say however that it's a good movie in that you barely notice that it lasts 2 1/2 hours, but it could have been so much better (I know it's easy to criticize, but keep in mind that I always extend props to those who work on features. It's a lot of work and they do it well). And please, stop casting Helen Hunt, she really ruins movies for me.",
29 December 2000,A Movie to get you thinking,"Cast Away was truly one of those movies that gets a person thinking. I sat there through the whole movie just wondering what I would do if I was in the situation. Also, Tom Hanks did a marvelous job in this movies. It could be one of the best roles he has ever done. Finally Wilson the volleyball was my second favorite actor in the movie.

9 May 2008,What an amazing performance by Tom Hanks,"Cast Away is phenomenal, amazing, indescribably fabulous, and the list just goes on and on.

Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors to ever set foot on this planet, yes, but this wonder of a performance is a giant leap even for him. Tom Hanks takes you through all of the roller coaster emotions that you actually experience during extreme loneliness.

Cast Away is just overall a brilliant film about what one man must go through to get back home. When Tom Hanks meets and becomes friends with his volleyball friend, (I'm not going to give out any names) you actually start to become attached to the object just as Tom Hanks was in the film. when what happens at the end happens, the viewer actually feels sympathy for the volleyball! That's how great this movie is! The viewer actually begins to treat the ball as a person!

Cast Away is an instant classic, and is a film that absolutely everyone should see.",10

9 October 2006,"Thoughts About ""Wilson""","I did see the movie in the theater, and, did watch it twice on TNT over the weekend, but, the part about Wilson bothered me in the theater, and, it still bothers me - since this was just a volleyball, and, even though I like volleyball and play it often (my serve is just okay), I hope that I'd never make a volleyball into a companion.

My point - in ""reality"", he did bury a man that he knew - aside from saying, ""Well, that's it"" on burying the man's body (without even a decent prayer), it would have made more sense for him to do something that I did just yesterday on visiting my parent's graves (it's their anniversary) - even though in your heart you know that they are not there, another part of you, deep down, does feels comfortable talking to them when standing at the graveside.

In my mind, it would have given Chuck Noland much more comfort if he had talked to this man as often as he felt the need to stand at his graveside, during his time on the island (again, since many people do that every day in real life), and, this brings up another issue - many in real life talk to God every day when alone (I've done this more than once) - why didn't he resort to this, instead of using a rubber ball as a confidant? It gave me the impression that Chuck might not believe in God, since, during the entire film, he never mentioned God once, except as an exclamation (which isn't very useful to anyone), though, sadly, it might have been the filmmaker's attempt to remain ""politically correct"".

I did have to chuckle at the ""4 Year Chuck Noland"" - who looked very much like the ""3 Years Running Forrest Gump""!

Talk about life imitating art - as I typed this, the FedEx truck just pulled up, and, I signed for one small (but dry) FedEx box, and, one FedEx envelope - the man didn't look like Ramon, Fyodor or Chuck...

Take care,

Frank

P.S. Did anyone notice Joe Conley's (Ike Godsey from ""The Waltons"") in the role of Joe Wally, in the Christmas Eve dinner table scene? Apparently, the Director even gave Joe the courtesy of having a line that everyone could hear, since all went silent during his comment to Chuck - on checking on this site, sure enough, it was Joe Conley...",
11 January 2001,Infomercial,"OK, so does anyone know how much FedEx payed to have their name plastered throughout this movie? I can only think of a few scenes in the entire movie where their name wasn't on the screen. That got very annoying.

The movie itself was just excruciatingly boring. You could have easily trimmed 40 minutes off of it. Just stay home and watch Forrest Gump on TV and wait for a FedEx commercial.

19 February 2001,FANTASTIC!,"Once again Tom Hanks doesnt disappoint his fans, his work is once again brilliant! As in all his roles he delivers his lines with sheer genius quality however in this film he spends much of his time alone and not speaking yet his acting touches the audience as if he is verbally communicating. Just the look of his face, the gestures, everything.....all communicates to us his pain and suffering. The plane crash scene is just amazing, it is so very vivid and you find yourself in your seat gripping the armrest and holding your breath, as if you are a passenger on this plane as well!! What the character Tom Hanks plays goes thru in order to simply survive the plane crash is just the nightmare beginning for him.

I personally felt such a spiritual feeling from this movie. His character's guardian angel is the one who gets him thru this long ordeal and perhaps you will agree with this interpretation once you see it.

This is really a must see film and please dont wait for the video or the television showing of it.....you MUST see and hear it on the ""big screen!!""",10
24 December 2000,Cast Away: about as thrilling as a nap,"Well, Tom Hanks acting was good, the location was good, and the photography was good. However, I found the movie to be long, dull, plodding....a collection of cliches. The story seemed stagnant and unoriginal, and there seemed to be numerous chunks of the film that should have fallen to the cutting room floor.

Not a bad film, but not a good film either, at least insofar as entertainment value goes.

21 January 2001,What's all the noise about?,"A friend and I went to see this movie the day it opened in our local cinema. We heard so much about it, and the reviews were very good so... But we were very very disappointed. There's no plot, no character development, no real excitement (apart from the plane crash), and no emotional involvement on the viewer's behalf. True, the main part of the movie is supposed to be slow, calm and even ponderous, but it's not - it's boring. Also, the most interesting parts of the story are left out, i.e. the time spent on the Island. Instead, we see Tom Hanks getting on the island, getting a few scratches, making fire and then he's suddenly on his way home (like you would have expected otherwise).

what can you say about a movie in which a volley ball gets the best lines, and its acting is much more convincing than mr. Hanks'? Willson should get an oscar for his performance. Otherwise, this movie is so overlong, boring and pretentious, it's a sure winner of the Academy award.

31 March 2001,"great acting, but where did the years go?","Cast Away is a great film for the family to see together. Except for being long, it showed the resilence of a human being trying to survive. The movie jumped from Tom Hank's arrival; then, suddenly, it was 4 years later. It might have made more sense if his years on the island were divided up into individual years. In the beginning, he was at a loss as how to survive. By the end, he knew how to use his resources. In between, it might have shown how, with each year, he acquired new skills. The crash scene was really convincing. Tom Hanks managed to inject some humor into his situation. I loved the Wilson soccer ball made into a companion. Toward the end, he showed deep despair over his loss of it. It's incredible how he managed to survive on that raft he made. He seemed like more of an urban guy than some rugged survivalist. Losing his girlfriend to another man was a sad reality, but if he survived a hostile environment for 4 years, he'd survive this too.

27 December 2000,True to life,"A very well crafted film. There were absolutely no shortcuts taken in the plot, something I admire greatly. Every response was true to the characters. The acting was superb. The crash was one of the most frightening scenes I have ever seen. Someone I talked to (who hadn't seen the film) said he heard that scene dragged on. I replied that I too had wanted it to end, but not because it was dragging, but because it was truly horrifying -- maybe that's what they meant. Great filmmaking.

14 August 2001,Good film - could have been a masterpiece,"I agree with the general consensus that the first two-thirds of this film are brilliant, and the final third is somewhat anticlimatic and disappointing.

The plane crash scene was unforgettable - very realistic and heart-stopping. And of course, all the scenes with Hanks on the island, and then struggling to get off it really were outstanding and showed what a brilliant actor Hanks is, and what a great director Zemeckis can be.

One of the main problems in the final third is the music - too much of it, and too syrupy. I remember there were two scenes, practically back-to-back, with the same melodramatic, distracting music. These scenes probably would have been perfect without any music. Note that there was no music during the crash or the time on the island.

My rating for this film is therefore: For the first two-thirds - 10/10 For the final third - 5/10",8

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",4
14 March 2001,Yay!!,"I enjoyed the learning how my life would change after many years without being known or heard of. That's why im hoping i don't get hung up in a situation like in this movie.

I enjoyed the acting and that crash scene. The island scene was pretty comical in many parts.

6 August 2001,Hanks' performance completely saves what could have been another boring survival flick,"At it's heart, Cast Away is simply a survival picture telling the tale of a man's isolation and lonliness for over four years on a desolate island, lacking any large amount of food, or even wildlife, in the tropics. So lonely, in fact, Chuck Nolan (Hanks) spends some time speaking to a volley ball for half of the movie, and even crying for it's loss. This could have been a hilarious situation, something for a Saturday Night Live parody of the 'Survivor' TV series, but Hanks is so convincing and human in his performance, he doesn't hold anything back. You can't help be sad for the poor volleyball's (named ""Wilson"") fate, when really you, the audience are sad for Hanks losing his sanity while adrift in a wood raft (the director, Robert Zemeckis, sure has a good way of manipulating the audience). There are also many special effects in Cast Away that one wouldn't notice, just take for granted as part of the filmming - there are many SFX scenes in Cast Away, but none of them are used for 'eye candy', like many, MANY other films today. You just can't help but root for Hanks throughout the entire movie, so he can get off that stinking island. Also, the bulk of the film, when Nolan is on the island after the plane crash (which is easily the best scene of last year, 2000), will totally immerse you into his isolation, thanks in part to no cutting back to what's going on back where his girlfriend is waiting for him - so many movies have been ruined in part to this, (The Perfect Storm a great example). Instead, the characters tell him what happened later on. And somehow, there is little to no dialogue in the 'survival' bulk of this movie but it never gets boring. NEVER. Zemeckis should have taken a hint while making What Lies Beneath in between Cast Away.

Not that Cast Away is perfect.

The film loses steam when Nolan returns home, but there are still some great scenes ahead, but once again, I am not bought on Helen Hunt in the role of Nolan's motivation for going on and trying to get off the island (there is a short scene involving him hanging himself). Just like in Pay it Forward, she's not too convincing and is best suited for Richard Gere chick flicks like Dr. T and The Women.

And no - the trailer didn't reveal much about the film. You see - Cast Away isn't about plot - it's about damn good acting.

4 January 2002,A good movie,"I saw it at a theatre when it first came out and rented it again last week. It is not a great movie, just a good movie. Tom Hanks plays his role well as he usually does.

It is worth watching a couple of times but not worth buying and taking up valuable space in your video collection.

22 February 2005,What could be worse than Tom Hanks on an island by himself for two hours?,"This movie is the definition of Tom Hanks cheesiness. Mr. Hanks plays a stranded Federal Express worker who gets trapped on an island, and from there the fun never stops! Tom Hanks insults my intelligence and I hope the intelligence of all of the other people who see him as he is; a man who is willing to do anything to get that third nod from the Academy. Nothing would ""establish"" himself better as one of the greatest actors of all time than a third Oscar. Is it me or is it impossible for old Tommy H. to have a movie where he doesn't try to jerk our tears. I see Tom Hanks as he is. He is a phony, and nothing could be worse than spending my money on watching Tom Hanks on a TV for two hours.

19 September 2018,A new take on the Robinson Crusoe tale,"Robert Zemeckis has directed a new take on the Robinson Crusoe saga with a man marooned on an island with nothing more than his perseverance and patience. This may be an adventure film on the surface but there are underlying themes of loneliness, loss and isolation. Of course, there are some stupendous scenes, this being CGI obsessed (in a good way) Zemeckis. The plane crash is a highlight and different from what we have seen in other films and the island scenes with the waves are amazing. As mentioned above Hanks is so good you cannot picture anyone else in his role and his collaboration with the director keeps on flourishing (they also made the critically lauded Forrest Gump). Do not miss Castaway for anything.

26 January 2001,This is it?,"I was sorely disappointed by this hyped-up and overrated film that promised to be something enjoyable. So much was left out in an attempt to squeeze a promising storyline into a few hours. I can't fathom a man being lost for 4 years and so easily integrating himself into society. ""Hey, guys, I'm back"". I was disappointed by the ending. Although it left the audience with something to think about, I thought it was cheesy and underdramatized. I'm afraid to say that Tom Hanks is losing his touch.

17 December 2000,Best film since The Insider,"I read some really bad reviews before I had the opportunity to see the film myself; This is not only a good story that makes you think about the way you live your life at the moment but also takes its time to develop real characters and has btw. the most realistic airplane crash I've ever seen;

nobody's talking your ears off ( not much dialogue when you're alone on an island ...), you only get the actor's physical reaction expressing his inner state of mind and Tom Hanks is just doing a terrific job !!! No other movie this year - except The Insider and perhaps Gladiator - had me leaving the theater still thinking about what I had just seen.

1 January 2001,this might be the one.......,"Cast Away is excellent!

Tom Hanks' performance is the best of the year; no music, no effects, no fancy anything for about an hour and a half, just Tom Hanks performing in front of the camera. He, not only performs, but he shines and entertains and inspires! His performance might be genius!

While I give most of the credit of Cast Away to Tom Hanks, the photography was also good! The conclusion was somewhat awkward and unfocused, unlike the rest of the film, but still very interesting! This is one film I encourage everyone to see...NOW!

A great achievement by Hanks, once again.

I liked it because it was very realistic, especially for a movie about such a strange situation. Tom Hanks did his normal good job and I even liked the ending, even though many didn't. I'm glad they made the audience think about what he was going to do rather than spoil it for us.

18 June 2007,Almost there.,"When I first saw this film, I thought the execution was amazing from a great filmmaker in Robert Zemickis.

However, once Hanks gets to the island, it falls flat after 1 hour.

You can only be on an island that long.

I told my date at the time, they should have introduced ghosts, monsters, weird hatches, etc.

Well, 4 years later, they made LOST.

Lost is what Castaway could have been.

Instead of a documentary, they could have made a very entertaining cast away movie.

Nonetheless, Zemickis and Hanks, I know both wanted a mature look at a very well-used topic. They partially succeeded, I guess.

Good film, but could have been so much better.

7/10.

LOST (TV SHOW) 10/10",7
13 March 2001,Tom Hanks' show,"This one can be considered as Tom Hanks' one-man show. He excelled in conveying his emotions through his eyes' expressions and able to capture the audience in almost one hour(where he was stranded alone at the island). The ending might be too long and can be trim a bit. But then, what I like about the ending is because the reality of it. Tom Hanks should be awarded for his work in this movie. His performance is top notch, and he deserve an Oscar.

To the viewer, not having an update as to the time he has been on the island ( just a note along the bottom of the screen) one is left wondering how he is managing but as he doesn't seem to lose any weight you feel he's only been there a matter of a few weeks. Plus as he like things to be precise and seems to be a person who investigates and references things he is remarkably stupid on some basic survival techniques. Overly long and the end leaves you wondering, ""what now?""

9 January 2015,A wonderful film about abandonment and moving on,"I first watched this film as a rental shortly after my son was born. My ex was well onto her way towards leaving for good, and she still hasn't explained why, at least not with any grip on reality.

Without giving away any spoilers, this movie is a wonderful parallel to the simple fact that in life somethings things happen which are completely beyond our control. We can kick ourselves silly trying to figure out what we might have done better, but when it comes right down to it, the answer sometimes comes up, ""Nothing.""

Chuck Nolan finds himself in the same situation, faces additional setbacks, yet somehow manages to survive. His road back to life was as long as mine.

He made it. I made it. Perseverance is wonderful, even though it's initially painful as hell. Cast Away does a wonderful job paralleling the severe emotional journey of abandonment, survival, recovery, and the eventual re-awakenings of life all men go through when they're abandoned by their spouses through no fault of their own.

The term ""cathartic"" is a huge understatement.",8

From that point on I was just so lucky to experience Hanks talking to and having quite emotional arguments with ""Wilson""...interesting. This was just a lame movie. It took everything I had to finish watching it, and when I was done my eyes hurt from rolling them so much. I can't believe Hanks' still has a career after this horrible film!!

The first 3/4 of the movie are first rate; the ending was a little too obvious. They sort of hit the audience over the head a few times where subtlety would have served them better.

Tom Hanks is incredible in this. Zemeckis is good, but he has to watch himself; sometimes he gets a little too cute, like he did in the running scenes in Forrest Gump.

27 January 2001,"Amazing, Unforgettable Film","Some of the comments here are pretty ignorant. I found this film to be a powerful experience, and I am grateful for the message. I suppose the consensus is split (though I seem to find more positive comments). Some say the film is ""predictable"" and ""nothing happens"". Uhh, what would you prefer? For pirates to take over the island? Tom Hanks (who is extraordinary, by the way) is fighting to survive, and that seems fitting enough for me. Nothing is more moving, terrifying or thought-provoking. You must put some thought into this film to get something out, and it appears some were reluctant to do so. Entertainment value is not what ""Cast Away"" is about. I think it's one of the finest human dramas ever made, and I'll never forget it. The Hanks-Wilson relationship is touching beyond all odds, and despite a minor stumble during the conclusion, the movie retains its power. And I like the ending.

22 December 2000,Tom Hanks yet again proves why he is Mr.Mainstream.,"If you are a die hard movie addict (watch 4 + new movies a week) you will dislike this movie like I did.

This year produced many great original and or invative movies (The Cell, Traffic, Almost Famous and The Tao Of Steve) and many decent mainstream movies (X-Men, The Grinch and Meet The parents.)

Let's get back to the point just because a Tom Hanks, John Travolta, or Nick Cage is in a movie does it mean it will be good. I feel the best way to judge a movie is by who is in the supporting roles.

This movie casts Helen Hunt who herself has made good (As good as it gets) and not so good (Sexual Healing) but also cult favorites (Trancers 1,2,3). A reliable choice but I am sick of seeing this woman this year she was in 1. Dr. T and the Women 2.Pay It Forward and 3. What Women Want all released in the last quarter of the year. We saw so little of her since As Good As it gets and then it seems she took every role that came to her.

The rest of the cast really do not have any drawing power.

So the whole movie rests on Tom's back. Yes he can carry a movie. But can he carry it to the awards any more? I think not.

Tom did a DeNiro by changing his weight. (As many others have eg. Vincent D'Onofrio for full metal jacket) Which is hard to do and losing to look like he did in the movie is much harder then gaining. ( I give him that).

But in all respects this movie was MADE to make cry and not think. In my opinion a good movie should have you thinking about it after the lights come on.

As much as I was pulling for this movie I found it hard to like.

I hope Tom hooks up and makes a dramatic career change and play a brutal and sadistic killer in gory detail. (So he can take on more challenging roles after shattering his Mr.Mainsteam Title.)

But if you only go to the cinema once or twice a year this is the movie for you. After all my beef'en I still think this movie will get a couple of nods for the oscars because they needs tha mainsteam people ta watch!",1
11 March 2002,A good love story,"I was shocked again by those stupid moviegoers.

Cast Away is a love story. It just echoes a century old theme: is there a one love made for you in the world and will you find your other half in your life time.

The Chinese fables have an interesting character: old moon man. Every new baby is born, the old moon man ties an invisible thread at his toe, and he ties the other end at the toe of his true love. Eventually, the invisible thread will bring them two together. They'll live happily after forever.

The parcel was the invisible thread in the movie. Tom survived plan crash, isolation in an island for 4 years, drifting in a pile of woods in the deep ocean. His motivation might appear to come from the picture of his wife. But the real force at work is the power of invisible thread: the parcel with logo of wings.

It's a love story like the `Sleepless in Seattle' from a different angle.",
2 January 2003,Your time would be better spent in a coma!,"I checked my watch every two minutes beginning about 10 minutes after the plane crash. This movie was a criminal waste of my time. The plane crash was genuinely scary, but after that, nothing drew me in. I was so detached from the character that I only wanted him to commit suicide so that the movie would end.

20 January 2001,Bravo!,"CastAway is as strong and deep in storyline as any movie I can remember. Its gripping, happy, sad, and really not long enough. Near to the last scene (not going to spoil it in discussion) should have expanded more...It is really hard to sit through the film and not feel teary eyed. Tom Hanks has really established himself as a phenom. actor. Definitely gonna be one of my DVD must owns.

1 June 2021,Worst film in history,"I can't believe it won anything, a man crying about a ball made by Wilson

I would be trying to find all the wild berries and fruit

not to mention coccanuts.

You can spear fish with a stick and you can make a knife out of stone

Then use wood and twine to make your spear.

From the raft in that one opening scene.

I gave you a 5 because after hearing you say Wilson 5 times, I was appalled by the ratings of this movie.",5
22 March 2002,As real as it gets,"What a splash in the face. This movie was amazingly put together and Tom Hanks delivered a performance like no other. He was nominated for Best Actor for his role in this movie. At first, Castaway takes you down an easy-going slope of normalcy and everyday life that we easily take for granted. After that, it's pure survival that becomes so astonishingly gripping. It makes you sad, and it may even make you cry. Zemeckis and Hanks made another great movie together since Forrest Gump. Don't miss out on this movie, especially if your a Tom Hanks fan. The cons? I had a few minor ones. Like, how big was the island? I also didn't like how this movie ended but that is for you to decide. My rating: 9/10

15 October 2016,The Charm of The Film is Silence,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",7
9 October 2019,The movie had everything!,"Sometimes I get the feeling that there are interminable movies in the late 90s not only in one specific genre but in all of them. Robert Zemeckis ,the director of Back to the future series, made another masterpiece along with Tom Hanks and in my opinion this movie was somehow more interesting than Forrest Gump in which these two were cooperating together again.

Cast away definitely engrossed the audience attention for being so unique. The brief story might not sound fascinating but the story of men facing unknown is always interesting if it is followed by great actors and a rich screenplay and in this case particularly, it happened!

It's a story of a FedEx executive who's in a plane crash and he strives to survive in an island with no population. It demonstrates how modern people are so vulnerable to the nature and how we take for granted simple things like our easy access to food or electricity.

In general, everything related to the movie was marvelous and I didn't get bored not even for a second. They did a great job in making an average ordinary story into an incredible movie. I highly recommend it!",8
1 September 2001,It's God who has been cast away,"I found it incredible that someone stuck on a deserted island for four years not once is shown in prayer or seeking help from a higher power. As far as the movie is concerned the spiritual dimension does not even exist. The man can not rise above himself, all he can do is talk to his alter-ego, a volleyball. I guess the movie just reflects where society is today, at least a large segment of it.

3 August 2003,the whorst movie ever,"Why do we have to pay for a commercial by FEDEX. 80 minutes out of the 110 minutes this movie is a commercial for FEDEX. I feel very bad about Tom Hanks giving his credibility to a project like this. Does he really need the money this bad that he sign up for a movie like this.

8 January 2001,Boring and Disappointing,"Good performance from Hanks but the movie itself is not worth much. The only few interesting parts are partly shown in the trailer (why do they always have to do that). It could have been much better, especially in the last 45 minutes. And why do we have to see a fed ex add every 30 seconds, we know he's a damn employee ... commercial bulls**t, it gets annoying.

10 January 2001,"Great acting, boring movie","This is really sad and disappointing, seeing Tom Hanks in a badly scripted and directed movie. The idea was good but it turned out to be a 2+ hours FedEx commercial with no story. The time gap is horrible, even a kid could think of something better than displaying ""4 years later"". At least it deserves the Oscar for best commercial advertising.

2 July 2001,The movie was far deeper than I expected,"I'm not sure why this movie has such a low rating on IMDB -- 7.5 as I write this. The movie is far better than that, easily one of my all-time favorites. Granted, I like Tom Hanks and most of his bad movies are better than a lot of people's best.

But what I liked the most about the movie was the simple imagery, particularly the angel wings and the closing shot. That last shot might have seemed heavyhanded to some, but I thought it was near perfect.

And I really liked how the story was told, how they let four years go by and how what happened during those four years became important to the end. That was fairly deft storytelling.

The imagery and the storytelling added up to a story that was far more than just a 21st century rewrite of Robinson Crusoe. It's a movie I continue to think about two weeks after seeing it on video. That's a sign of something.

Lots of people have commented on Tom Hanks acting. I'll just say he remains one of my favorite actors.",10
23 December 2000,I fell soooo cheated.....,"First of all, let me register my agreement with nearly all of those who wrote before me in that Tom Hanks should and probably will win an Oscar for his performance here. That aside, I feel very cheated in that the movie completely failed to show the viewer what they want to see: the transformation of Chuck Nolan over 4 years on an island. The issue in this movie is not ""will he get off the island?"" for the trailers and previews and press releases have all told us that he spends four years there before being rescued. Okay -- now that we know that, the real issue then becomes ""how does he transform himself over the course of those four years?"" How does he grapple with desparation, depression, loneliness, sickness, weather, hope, fear, spirituality.....the list goes on and on. Certainly the movie need not go into every intrinsic detaila bout his life -- but the audience, I think, wants to SEE how he transforms himself -- not just be told, ""Four Years Later"". That is lame! All in all, even Hanks' stellar performance cannot save this film. Too many questions, too many plot holes, too many ""huhs!?!?!"". Thumbs down from me.

26 January 2001,"Tom was good, the movie was so-so","First of all, seeing 10458.5 commercials for this movie completely gave away the ending...HE GETS OFF THE ISLAND. Where is the suspense? Yeah, that's what I thought. There was NONE. Maybe that's why I didn't like it very much. Tom Hanks was very good though, I must admit. It was a very demanding role, and he performed it very well, and I would not be surprised if Mr. Hanks walked away with another Oscar this year. His wonderful performance almost made up for a less-than-exciting movie.

29 December 2000,As flat as the screen you read from,"Rarely do I write a review about a film I see, but I found it necessary to warn viewers of a film that is this repulsive and disastrous. The first 20 minutes of the film are a big commercial for FedEx (as you have seen in the trailer). Then, in a (I must admit, exciting) sequence, his (FedEx) plane goes down in the Atlantic Ocean.

Now the film gets REALLY dull. We see Tom Hanks play Survivor's Richard Hatch (with, thankfully, more clothes on), for a full hour where he talks to Wilson (enter the advertisement), his new friend VOLLEYBALL!

Then, you can brace yourself for the last grueling 23 minutes, and come out of the theater feeling like you just survived a plane crash yourself.

In conclusion, basically, Hollywood screwed up. The film is as flat as a news broadcast. If you want to see it purely for Tom Hanks extraordinary acting, good luck.

Be Warned: Seeing films without a plot can be hazardous...",
3 January 2001,Great performance by Hanks,"Cast Away is a decent film about the survivor of a plane crash. Tom Hanks proves his acting ability once more in a distinguished career, as he has over an hour of screen time by himself, with no actor to play off of and no musical score in the background. Such a feat is nearly impossible to pull off without strong acting abilities. The film is a little long, but the crash scene is very hauntingly real and the performance by Hanks is worth seeing.

14 November 2001,"Not much substance here, but Tom Hanks fans will (sadly) love it.","Good Points: About the only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was, overall, well made. Robert Zemeckis makes a good movie any way you slice it, and no one can debate Tom Hanks' acting prowess. The rest of the cast did well also.

Bad Points: But there it ends. There's nothing in Cast Away that hasn't been done already. You've got your typical 'stranded on a desert island' theme coupled with the 'trying to return to a life after years of being out in left field somewhere' idea, and it just makes for a rehash of old plot devices. And, I'm sorry, but ANYONE in their right mind would have ripped open that package in record time in case anything it held could aid in survival instead of keeping it intact so that it could be later delivered (you know...on the off chance you DON'T starve to death) with a burst of pride for a job well done. GIVE ME A BREAK. I swear, every time Hollywood uses some idiotic plot device just to do something tear-jerking, the heart of creativity dies a little more. Tom didn't seem to have a problem ripping open the rest of them now, did he? A REAL Fed Ex man would have kept them all! (Sh'yeah...and pigs might fly outta my butt!)

Bottom Line: Unless you're a Tom Hanks fanatic, don't waste your time. And if you are, broaden your horizons for pity's sake. Watch something else. This movie is just another excuse for rich people to get richer.",6
29 December 2000,A ho-hum disappointment,"This is probably just a matter of expectations, but I found Cast Away disappointing. The opening 20 minutes are so action packed they take your breath away. Once on the island, though, things slow to a crawl. Tom's character is such a slow learner and not particularly clever. You find yourself wanting to give him advice. The physical effect of years on the island are totally unbelievable. He suffers numerous wounds, but looks buff and unscarred after four years. Huh? Once he leaves the island, you hope things will pick up but they actually get worse. There's too much wasted time and too much that is pointless. And I haven't heard one person who liked the ending.

22 April 2002,An okay movie,"I adore Tom Hanks, but had been told this movie was not up to snuff. Well, I rented it anyway. I thoroughly enjoyed the plane crash sequence! I had to play that over several times. The genius of the set and direction in that sequence was wonderful to behold. I felt like I was in that crash, too. How he could hold his breath that long was a little far fetched, but still it was amazing. The part where he is on the island is okay. I expected a little more something, but was disappointed in the end. The scene when he meets back up with Helen Hunt is totally contrived. I didn't like that, but the ending was good. One could imagine which road he would take and what he would find.

29 March 2004,An Unconventional Piece of Mainstream,"Though this movie belongs to the department of Hollywood mainstream, it can boast a couple of devices that distinguish it from productions, normally spawned by this machine, and, at the same time, taking into account these devices' quite daring nature, render its tremendous box-office a bit puzzling.

The first one of them is, of course, that uncompromising with no breaks, regular dialogue or music island sequence which shows a quite memorable encounter of the hero with the ""benign indifference of the world"". This part of the film, especially the detailed description of the first days on the island highlighting how important our every step or action can - and, probably, should - be, reminds me of 1956 Robert Bresson's ""A Man Escaped"" that contains a meticulous report of an escape endeavour undertaken by a French prisoner during WW2.

In his usual merciless manner not only Bresson manages in his movie to render extremely important the main character's every single action and movement. He practically makes the audience ""fulfill"" them along with him, and thus creates tension beyond conceivable providing us with an actually ""physical"" notion of what it takes here to succeed (F.Truffaut called Bresson's movie one of the most accomplished attempts at creating a real time out of an imaginary one).

Similarly, Mr. Zemeckis in his one doesn't take the path of least resistance, and instead of just delivering a sympathetic character and emotionally involving situations makes us literally spend some time being encircled by the beautifully ruthless ocean and conjuring a spark out of damp wood (by the way, the French lieutenant's whispered recounting of his actions somehow corresponds to the dialogues with ""Wilson"").

And when the ""man escaped"" there comes the second device - which, I guess, has surprised, if not disappointed, those viewers who had been expecting a more conventional structure. And which evokes another allusion - this time to the similar structural device used in A. Hitchcock ""Vertigo"". In his masterpiece Hitchcock suddenly reveals the secret somewhat forty minutes before the actual ending and thus elegantly shifts the emphasis. He eliminates the mystery as a driving engine, but significantly amplifies for the viewer the dramatic effect of the heroine's final metamorphosis.

Here the escape from the island doesn't triumphantly round off the film either, but opens the third and, in a sense, most dramatic part of it - in which the protagonist goes back to the world that didn't get frozen when he had left it. And this part leads to the resolution that might seem not entirely satisfactory to some viewers, but, in fact, makes a perfect ending for this movie. Which does not probably avoid all clichés of conventional mainstream but, at least, gives it a good try. And, at the end of the day, manages to provide the audience with a fresh, in some ways bold, and in many ways touching contents.",
6 October 2004,Off Course,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away.

19 August 2006,What went wrong?,"What, exactly, went horribly awry in this film? Was it the hideously inappropriate corporate product placement? Was it the studious solemnity of Tom Hank's performance, and the resulting uncomfortable laughter at dental procedures and love for volleyball? The sheer obviousness of the film's attempts to grab at our heartstrings? Was the ending much admired in France? The whole caboodle looked great ""on paper"" I am sure. Robinson Crusoe! Rip van Winkle! Tom Hanks! Somewhere, in committee, were the makings of something that looked fine, yet, in its execution, went terribly wrong. No discredit to Broyles or Hanks, but the rest is left at as an exercise for film students and fans - excellent fodder for - what the heck happened with this? Like a fine wine, corked.

A disappointing ending that left you hanging in the end. It was about as satisfying to me as sanka to a caffene jones. I felt deserted by the writer. The movie suffers greatly by a lack of an ending..but that was maybe his purpose to leave you feeling a little like nolan. it's just two sceans short of a ten.

It didn't wimp out at the end with a storybook close and I appreciated that. Could it have been better. Yeah sure but then wasn't it great that there were no dinosaurs or pirates on the island!!

For a long film with limited dialogue it didn't drag for me and was a lot more interesting and fun that Survivor.

24 May 2006,That Volleyball Deserved a Freaking Oscar!!,"We all know who Tom Hanks is, but what about the volleyball? Simply an amazing performance by a truly underrated performer. Really, what a performance!

Anyway, the movie is quite alright, I wont call it a masterpiece, because it isn't, and I wont call it a 2 1/2 hour FedEx commercial either. It is a wonderful film of the more ""artsy"" side of things. The silence used in the film really adds to the movie, in a way that it becomes such a part of the feel, that without it, the viewer does not get that same feeling. There is an awful lot of time to think in this movie, but that is the point, time is the only benefit being stranded alone on a desert island can offer. To some, the film may come off as being boring and too long, but the rest will understand and begin to understand the plight of the character played by Hanks. It has an all too realistic theme to it as well, really, a good movie.

I really enjoyed. but what they could have changed was shorten the movie a bit if they took half an hour off the movie than the movie wouldn't ramble on the same parts. it was 2 1/2 hours and the last half an hour just kept going on and on. well anyways Cast away was a very good movie Tom Hanks And Helen Hunt Were excellent.

19 June 2001,Amazing!,"From its musical score, directing, special effects, location shooting, and the impressive acting ability of Tom Hanks to keep one mesmorized by his solo performance, This movie is a WINNER! To those who thought it was boring and stupid how he talked to a volleyball...you just dont get the concept of isolationism. I WEPT with Chuck Noland when HE wept over Wilson! It would have been a ""little"" more believable if maybe he was trapped for only 2 years instead of 4, but regardless, This movie was GREAT...it also contained the most realistic, terrifying airplane crash I've ever seen!

1 March 2015,Wouldn't watch it again,"Tom Hanks has to be one of the best actors out there.

I watched this movie because they made fun on it on Family Guy and I wanted to understand the joke. I felt like this movie relied on the beginning which was not to good... at all. The movie skipped time which left a gap in the plot and the realism of it. There was no standout acting performance. Well except Tom Hanks. I don't feel like this movie is what everybody is trying to make it, it is what it is.

I felt no realism in it (i can't do an a example without spoiling anything). This movie was almost just like All is lost except this is actually decent.

I'm going to recommend you too see this movie, cause it's an a have to watch film, it may not be good but it's an a have to watch

7 February 2001,Waves keeping us in,"What a storm. This little man in a yellow inflatable adrift on a giant wave one thousand miles from anywhere. On a tiny island trapped in by waves. Keeping company with a ball. With no hope. Hopelessly Distressed. But not so distressing as returning to a world in which you no longer belong. Grey walls, hard floors, technology, fine food and drink. How meaningless and prison like the real world seemed by comparison to the existentially terrifying little island. Isn't that strange? Tom Hanks is a very good actor, and of course the film could have explored much more interesting perameters than the ones it did, but, I enjoyed it, and I didn't cringe very much at all. Still one can wonder what Tom Hanks would have created as an actor if the film had been made without the typical three act, two turning points framework that failed so blatantly here. There was scope for something completely new and different. Still, an interesting film none the less.

31 December 2000,Boring & Trite,"I am not playing devil's advocate, but I cannot in good conscience read all of the hyperbolic praise for this movie without making a dissenting comment.

First, Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is not an actor. He is a star, perhaps a superstar, and a comforting presence (much like Harrison Ford). I am not an actor, and yet I could have easily done as good a job portraying Forrest Gump as Hanks did. Tom Hanks is appealing in every film in which he appears, I acknowledge. However, I find myself suffering from a Hanks-allergy. This is certainly my loss, but I find Hanks too cloying to endure.

Jimmy Stewart frequently portrayed the same sort of character as Hanks, but Jimmy Stewart had more than one facial expression. Tom Hanks, unfortunately, comes from the Clint Eastwood/John Wayne/Harrison Ford school of acting - which means no acting is required at all, but only looking into the camera and quoting your lines with virtually the same emphasis on every word. Of course, I know that these stars have more talent than that, but not much more.

Second, Robert Zemeckis. Has he really directed a good film since Back to the Future? That film had a few surprises, but Cast Away had none. Was anybody really surprised how it ended? Was there a single element in the middle which surprised? Indeed, if you took out the plane crash and the (admittedly humorous) roleplaying with the volleyball, was there anything about the film which even involved?

Helen Hunt was, well, Helen Hunt. If you are a Helen Hunt fan, then you were probably pleased. If you find her plain and uninteresting (as I do - although my father finds her hot), then she added nothing to the movie.

I have seen worse movies this year, but not many. I hope that this review persuades a few people to spend their money on more worthy efforts - Before Night Fall, for example - and to reconsider the near-veneration that likeable, though not particularly talented, Tom Hanks inexplicably recieves.",
1 January 2001,A Mixed Bag,"A good idea but not taken far enough. The plot is painfully predictable once we realise he's eventually going to be saved. The most interesting developments were those on the island. A 'stranded' movie would have been more interesting. The rest of the movie serve as cheap white bread that sandwiches a good piece of meat. The whole project smells of uncertainty and indecision.

27 December 2000,A Film That Proves The Triumph of the Human Spirit!!!,"I went to see Cast Away not knowing what to expect. There were many things that were said about the film that made me apprehensive about going to see it. People told me the film was boring and that there was not much dialogue. True, there is not much dialogue, but if you think about it, why would there be. He is stuck on an island by himself. The things that make this film interesting is the sheer fact that you feel as if you were there with you. I don't believe that the title refers to him as a ""Castaway"" on an island, but in fact ""Cast Away"" from the world and his friends and family. Tom Hanks is remarkable in this role. If he does not win an Academy Award for this role then there will be many upset people out there. Something that made this movie feel all the more intense is the fact that there is no music. All you hear are the waves, the wind, and the coconuts falling. It makes you feel like you are truly out on the edge of the world alone with nothing except some rocks and an old soccer ball named, Wilson. Cast Away is a an exceptional movie experience like none other. Joel Seigel said it best, ""Tom Hanks and Director Robert Zemekis have none the impossible...You will walk out of the theater in absolute awe.""",10
26 December 2000,Hanks does it again,"This movie was amazing ... I really enjoyed it .Tom Hanks is such a talented actor that he can pull off talking to a volleyball for much of the movie......Pay close attention to the begining and the end.. I have read alot where people do not understand the ending much(go to the boards here ,a user whose name i can not recall who wrote something that helped me better understand it) I took my ten year old to this movie...she refused to leave and go to the bathroom for fear of missing something).....

28 July 2001,Where's the beef ?¿,"I love Tom Hanks but I hated this movie. Best part was the Wilson Spaulding joke ... and that wasn't all that great. Nothing to think about, predictable ending (figured out the ending when I first heard the title of the movie), long lapses of nothings with nothings to follow.

I wouldn't recommend this film unless you really like Tom Hanks movies. I mean his acting was fine but the story sucked the big cahoona.

Regards,

14 February 2001,One big ad for Fedex...,"This film just about takes the biscuit for product placement. From the first second to the end take we're under pressure to believe Fedex is the best thing ever to hit Planet Earth. We learn all about the Fedex methods, how packages are rushed from A to B and Tom lends his full weight to getting the Fedex message over, even to those disorganised Russians. The Fedex theme is skilfully woven through the whole film, with presumably Wilson contributing with basketballs ad infinitum. The Fedex packages keeping poor Tom alive. For those who ship by Fedex, UPS and others like DHL, I was particularly amused by Helen Hunt's cautionary references to ""undeclared hazardous goods"" being the probably cause of the plane crash. Heaven forbid, pilot error or some other employee disaster. And of course, Tom at the end shows how Fedex delivers regardless, as he appears on Fedex TV, with Fedex planes reaching as far as the horizon. As usual Helen Hunt is a miserable mess. How she managed to get into movies, well, enough said.

On the other hand, ignoring the Fedex overdose, Tom pulls the whole thing together and makes the movie. I was truly moved when he apologised to his escaping basketball.

Zemeckis must be one of the most talented directors who ever lived and Hanks is going to be a true legend. I can only hope the Hanks - Zemeckis partnership will strike gold again.",7
23 December 2000,The best movie ever!,"In other words the greatest movie of all times!!! Tom Hanks helps it through. Without him this movie just wouldn't be right. This movie is a mind boggaling movie that touches your heart in places that haven't been touched before. The movie takes place a little in my state! And then goes to-- well-- a plane crash... And we all know what happens there don't we? Even though Helen Hunt wasn't in the movie that much she did make it seem like she was there the whole time. Without her I don't know how the movie would do. It's just a great combination in this movie. Laughing, crying, terrifying events at times, and the relief that he is finally home. I give it ***** stars for the system the credits go by in Hollywood and ********** for the system here in IMDB

25 December 2000,Tom Hanks does it again,"Tom Hanks once again proves he is one of the best actors on the large screen. You can feel his anguish when he realizes his situation on the island. I appreciated the lack of music during his island stay. You heard and felt what it was like there. The plane crash was real and scary.

29 December 2000,A Three Act Play Where One Act Would Have Sufficed,"There is one positive in this movie: It solidifies Tom Hanks as not only one of America's most beloved actors, but also one of the best. There is a sequence in the middle of the movie where Hanks begins to figure out exactly how far away from everyone and how large the search area for his crash is that is simply heartbreaking. Hanks stunning acting on the island, however, is muted by the opening where he is surrounded by cardboard cutouts of stock characters, the brilliant island footage, and then he returns right back into cardboard cutouts and forced situations. This movie is worth seeing, worth thinking about for a moment, and that is about all....

17 April 2001,A type-A executive for FedEx gets stranded on an island,"How can an actor reduce you to sobbing over his relationship with a volleyball? If you want to know, see ""Cast Away"". Tom Hanks is a wizard, and everything he touches, it seems, turns to gold. This is not a great movie, no competitor for the Best Picture Oscar. But Tom deserved his nomination for Best Actor! One fine, fine movie.

15 June 2001,Bit of a disappointment,"Seeing the likes of Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan gave me the impression that this would be another outstanding performance by Tom Hanks. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. The acting was very impressive, but the plot seemed to be non-existent. They show him when he first became stranded on the island, then they show what happened four years later. What on earth were they thinking? Before that, I was very impressed, but afterwards, it was just completely ruined. A little too far-fetched and way too long for my liking. I left the cinema in great disappointment.

25 February 2002,"This movie should be ""Cast Away""","This movie should be cast away because it sucks! I have never seen such a long commercial for Fed ex as this. It's two and a half hours of tripe. The plane crash scene is well shot and I really liked the part where he's deserted and stuff but the rest is long and excruciatingly boring. Tommy, my son, do something worthwhile like deserting yourself on an island for 4 years if your going to put yourself in another migraine-initiater like this one. Sorry, i didn't mean to be to negative imdb but this movie is kind of crappy.

19 January 2022,Cast away,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",9

10 November 2002,This film was good because it really touched me.,"My idea of a good film is one that makes me think about it a long time after I've seen it. My other main criteria is that it touches me in some way that I can relate to. This movie did both. It made me cry. As soon as I saw it I wanted to run home and call my boyfriend and tell him how much I love him because as Chuck found out, you never know how much time you'll have. It broke my heart to know that two people so deeply in love could not be together, and I could feel the pain of that separation. That, to me, makes this an incredible film.

14 October 2003,True acting...,"What Hanks has done with this film is he has taken a simple, yet unlikely, story about a relatively normal person and created a believable, and humanistic, experience. Sure the directing and story are a little over the top, but Hanks' performance alone allows you to look past the movies deficiencies and see the struggle that exists within the human consciousness. Let me just ask you this, how many actors could get you to shed a tear for a volleyball?

When he sees the Gold Wings on the back of Lari White's pickup, you could almost see the life coming back into Tom Hanks. I do admit I don't understand why he didn't open up her package on the island. I liked the film as a whole and wish we could have seen the transformation during the four years.

6 January 2001,A shameless FedEx Commercial with a great advertisement for Wilson sporting goods thrown in!,"I am outraged at watching this horrible sell-out movie that serves the purpose of making money and promoting FedEx as a saintly company. It starts out watching the efficent delivery of a package. Then Tom Hanks giving speeches about packages not even being a minute late and FedEx can not be like the postal service. Hell, the movie makes it painfully obvious he cares more about FedEx then his girl. Then the FedEx plane crashes. He is stranded and FedEx packages float to shore and save him. On the way he makes friends with a wilson volleyball and the sell-out director even goes low enough to name the ball ""wilson"", so you can be reminded what brand the freaking ball is! Then he gets back on a FedEx plane. FedEx people give speeches about him. Then after breaking up his girl, he goes to deliver a FedEx package. This delivery of the package that ""saved"" his life, leads him to another romantic interest just in the nick of time. What am I saying? FedEx is god. This movie warped my fragile little mind. I can't wait until all movies, songs and book are about companies!

23 December 2000,Paradoxical and Beautiful Filmmaking,"As I left the theater after seeing Cast Away, I had a strange mixture of emotion in my mind. Perhaps this was due to the disappointing quasi-Hollywood ending that followed the terrible yet surreal ordeal of a man who grasps at hope of escape from the island he has been physically imprisoned on after a plane crash. But I have a feeling that Robert Zemeckis, an accomplished and innovative director, inserts this incredulity for a purpose. And the more I consider it, this weakness complements its powerful central segment in which actor Tom Hanks grapples with the forces of Nature. Upon his return to civilization, he finds that his former life dissipated and thus the audience's hollowness resulting from the film's frail ending analogously parallels the protagonist's tumultuous emotions and uncertainty about how to proceed. I recommend Cast Away because it is a wonderful film in many respects; these achievements far outweigh any regrets about its finale. The lavish photography of Tom Hank's solitary struggle against his island prison and the beautiful yet harsh Pacific Ocean brings a humanitarian spirituality to the film. This brought me an appreciation for the seemingly petty elements of civilization that we frequently see and ignore (in a manner quite similar to American Beauty in my opinion). The hidden element of film of sound really contributes to Cast Away by pounding each and every wave that hits the protagonist's weak little raft deep into the audience's mind, expressing the brute power of the ocean wonderfully. And of course, the darkly humorous acting of Tom Hanks plays the key role, seeking to mask his desperation by introducing Wilson the volleyball, a ""character"" that he converses with freely. Enjoyable and intriguing, Cast Away has been quite possibly the best Hollywood film of the year, in my opinion.",9
4 January 2001,"good film, should have been set in the 60s","My only real complaint about Cast Away is that it is virtually impossible to get lost on a tropical island, WITH a life raft (since rafts nearly universally I think, in this modern day have emergency transmitters (EPRBs or something like that) that can be picked up by satellite and your location gets sent to the coast guard). The jets radio black out is also rather implausible. The lack of infection from a major injury in topical (bacteria infested) waters is also at least extremely lucky. One of the things I liked abou it is that its sort of just a story of a guy going through an amazing experience, just s slice of life, not major upheaval and resolution and etc etc, an amazing slice of life due to the circumstances, but just a guy somehow managing to get thorugh it. Could have been you or me. That, in addtion to the excellent direction, on location etc. gives it a very realistic feel. I think Philadelphia is still Hank's best work, but Cast Away is good.

23 January 2001,Psychologically Fascinating,"This film delves into the psychological transformations of a modern American man forced into cave man island solitude for 4 years. The portrayal of his coping mechanisms and the development of eccentricities is quite evocative and understandable. [Don't we all act a little odd at times when we are alone?] His re-emergence , the trailer gives that away] is realistically portrayed in a way that invites reflection rather than complacency. I liked the ending. 9/10.

Tom Hanks is a very honest and truthful actor when handled correctly. Compare this to how ham-fisted Shpielberg ""uses"" Hanks' simplicity and economy of expression in the inferior ""Private Ryan"". Had S.S. directed this we would have had to SEE the wedding ring reappear, Kelly's picture would have slowly faded etc... Now the only problem is that S.S. has gotten his hands on Kubrick's last project ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" and already produced a schmaltzy trailer with the silhouette of a little boy right out of his schmaltzy Dreamworks logo(you KNOW he designed that cutesy / pukey image).GREAT FILM.

24 December 2000,Awesome movie!,"Just like the feather in the movie Forrest Gump is representative of the thin thread that binds us all together, in the movie ""Cast Away"" the director once again takes us on a journey about the binding story of humanity. The movie works under the premise that everything happens for a reason, therefore we must strive to ""breathe"" every day because as Tom Hanks' character in the movie says, ""Tomorrow the sun will rise. You never know what the tide will bring"".

This movie simply mesmerised me! I highly recommend it for anyone that is looking for an uplifting, well-acted, as well as action-packed movie!

25 June 2003,The ending,"This is a great great movie, but like many the ending for me was unsatisfying. The entire point of a movie is not having to think about the next actions of the protagonist, its about thinking about why they made the choices they made. ALthough i like what the director has done with the choices/cross roads scene, i think for Chuck to make a choice and for the audience to see that it was the right choice would have been a better ending.

Hanksy and Huntsy give excellent performances and i cannot reccomend this movie highly enough, although by saying that i have reccomended this film highly enough.........and now ive lost my audience.

ps im training to become a journalist, i hope my clarity improves.

22 January 2001,A sabbathic experience,"I saw it hours before I wrote this lines and I'm still feeling exhausted as I cried for about 2/3 of the picture. It's a cleansing, sabbathic and religious experience watching this movie. Not because it mentions the word God or other divine entity (note the funeral) but it has faith and the character believes in itself even when he thinks he no longer exists as a human. Beginning with a crossroad somewhere in the middle of an American desert (instantly reminder of ""North by Northwest"") the movie starts within a minute in a frantic pace of a FedEx box traveling (physically and with the camera) from America to Russia in another well-remembered voyeur-voyage by Zemeckis. Frantic or not, we soon discover the meaning of TIME and SPACE in this multiple-paced well-placed cameras showing the exact spots of what Time and Space are supposed to stand in the castaway's life. Zemeckis' twisting and turning views in this movie are sometimes experiencing what the character does, other times before and after him and we enjoy more viewing this movie as a voyeur (didn't Hitchcock teach us a lesson about the art of cinema?) rather than what's going to happen in the plot which is a bit secondary. Then, there are the boxes. The Pandora boxes, only this time what's inside them loses power for what they are and steps in another dimension of their usefulness. They act as tools and sometimes as characters to solve the problems of one's Cast Away. They expand time (the volleyball ""ball"") and produce space (the blades of the ice rollerskate). Finally, the blood. Lots of it. Not like a sign of death but incredibly, as a flux of life that the castaway uses to generate his feelings (Wilson or Son of Will) or to survive (the blood spill when he's making fire) and, thus returning to the religious thoughts in the start of the comment, he must need to sacrifice his body in order to (re)gain spiritual meaning about being alive. Note detail: he only eats after a long time drinking coconut MILK! Crossroads are exactly where this post-modern urban castaway stands in the beginning of the movie regarding his multiple choices. Career/marriage, workplace/home to name a few. Eventually he'll get to make one in a limit situation: the girlfriend's watch opposed to the lifeguard-waistcoat. It's a nice ellipse when he ends up in the place that was only known by the viewer in the beginning, having to choose a course in the vast desert. And this time he really chooses! P.S.: I hope Tom Hanks will deservedly be the first man to win three awards for leading role in the history of Oscars!",
18 January 2005,Simply the Best,"Any one reading my comments will quickly notice the common denominator - Mr. Tom Hanks. This might make people think my comments would be biased as I am clearly a fan but then there was SPLASH, enough said.

I have seen the film about 5 times but the last time was the best. Not only did a few loose bits fall in to place (two names above the ranch entrance at the beginning then ...) but i seemed to experience all the emotions of every character as they played out. I nearly cried when he cried on the raft over Wilson ( OK I actually did) and when Kelly was beside herself at the Airport reunion I wanted to reach out and help her do the right thing. (for us anyway) The jeep/taxi scene at the end was magnificent and the rain made all the difference. Then the way he spills out his emotions at the realisation of losing Kelly again was just superb.

As always see the film for yourself and make up your own mind.

For me, 10/10 Top of the class Mr. Hanks, Ms. Hunt a close second.",10

2 October 2023,Academy Award Winner no. Far Better a Film!,"When I first saw Cast Away almost 30 years ago, it helped change my life in addition to being a next level movie. That Tom Hanks was able to make me fall in love with ""Wilson"" through the careful screenplay and acting development is stellar.

My wife of 20 years and I watched Cast Away this evening - both of us not having seen it since it's 2000 premier. This film is as fresh and powerful as it was for a 23 yrs hence. Bob Zemeckis' direction, the most beautiful cinematography +++

How on earth is this not an Academy Award Winner at first boggles the mind but then one realizes that Cast Away is simply far too marvellous a body of work for ""The Academy"" period.

5 October 2004,1 of the best films ever made!,"1 of the best films ever made! I brought this film without even knowing what it was about, just because Tom Hanks was in it. I was not disappointed at all. Tom Hanks makes the film, hes great! 10 out of 10. Due to the best acting, the film is very powerful, it speaks many volumes. I would recommend anyone to watch this film, as i think it would suit anyone. It has the drama, the comedy and even a little romance in. with all these quality's, its a film you can watch over and over again, still with a smile on your face. I love the humour they have put into it. Not many films can pull tragedy and humour off at the same time, but this film works wonders, it really does all fit into place.

27 January 2001,Could've been GREAT...but..,"What a disappointment....and waste.

Tom Hanks aka Modern Man, stuck on an island, with no food, water or communications. Its obvious that he will somehow fend for himself and salvage all the bare necessities required. This film shows just that - and ONLY that. It did not portray the more humane (and psychological)side of the situation, that is: How and what does a man FEEL when alone on an island? Hanks displayed little, if not, no signs of fear, despair or disillusion during the initial stages of his strand. He did not break down and was not torn by internal conflicts of loss, hope and reality. Sadly, the producers had to use a volleyball (Wilson) to elicit such emotions from him. The next thing you know, its 4 years later and Hanks has become an expert spear fisherman.

And after being exiled from society for 4 years, we're supposed to believe he could adapt again in 4 weeks?!?! C'mon! Although the film did try to hint at his ineptness and awkwardness ( more reserved, sleeps on the floor, sense of loss over unfinished food ), it never really does hit the correct emotional note. No oomph.

His re-unification with Helen Hunt was a tad too dry. Little emotions were shown from them, as if both sides were suppressing bottled-up feelings; though Hunt seems more likely to be the culprit.

Overall, a film with some beautiful visuals and a great plane crash scene. There were many chances for the film makers to capitalise on for more powerful scenes, but I guess they just didn't know how. ""Survival Skills:101"" seems like a more apt title.

Perhaps Wilson's final scene was its only saving grace....",
11 August 2001,Mostly Boring!!!!,"To sum up this movie in as few words as possible I'd have to say, good acting (Hanks), same old boring desert island story, and about 20 minutes too long. Some scenes were dragged out much too long for whatever effect I have no idea. Too much talent (Hanks) wasted on a mediocre movie with a less than mediocre story-line.

22 December 2000,Cast Away all other movies and see this ...,"This movie is great. There's no other way to put it. Tom Hanks does a great job as the man who must learn to survive against nature and against his own weakness. This movie shows that man needs three things for survival: food, shelter, and companionship.

The musical score was only in existence when Hanks was in civilization. This brings to the audience the sense of being there alone. Often times music enhances the viewing experience, but in the case of Cast Away the lack of music enhances the experience.

There is a good deal of comic relief as portrayed by the volleyball. ""Wilson"" as he is titled becomes one of the audience's favorite characters, and should have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor in a Role by the Golden Globes.

It's a great movie to see with friends and family, but there are some questionable scenes for younger kids. I would advise seeing it first before you take your ten year-old son or daughter to see it; don't make the same mistake most parents made with ""Saving Private Ryan.""

Helen Hunt's character was not one we learned to love and most people will be apathetic towards her. She's not one of the main characters; only a main influence. Hence, the end of her paragraph.

Does Hanks deserve an award for his role and portrayal of the man who is cast aside by nature? Yes. Hanks does a great job in this movie and no other could have done it as well. Do I think he'll win? No. Going up against the other actors in his category is a hard battle, and Crowe was better in Gladiator than Hanks was in Cast Away.",8
23 July 2001,forget the hype - one of the most boring movies you will see,"how did they suck so many people in to go watch nothing for 2 hours ?? talk about a show about nothing - it make seinfeld look like pulp fiction. dull dull dull. so many obvious mistakes and way to much dramatic licence taken to make tom look like the dumbest cast away ever.

When I was watching this movie I never got bored at all and it went by rather quickly because it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The special effects in this movie are interesting as well.

And then after he gets back home that was the part I liked and enjoyed, beautiful scenes can be seen there

12 April 2001,Tom Hanks wasting time alone in a boring situation- how boring,"I think the director was trying to show the audience how boring years of solitary life on a deserted island can be. He was very successful.

This was the most boring movie I had ever seen next to the Blair Witch Project and The Dresser. I distinctly remember one scene where he found a cave for shelter when a sudden storm hit. He lay exhausted with his newly found flashlight left on. It wasn't enough to know that the batteries would be dead by the time he woke- they must have wasted a whole minute (seemed like five) showing him sleep with the flashlight on, slowly dimming near the end. It's about as boring as watching liver slide down the wall; and about as much fun.

20 November 2002,See It More Than Once and You'll GET IT.,"I saw Cast Away in wide release two years ago and it was a strong experience then primarily for Hank's marathon performance and the interpersonal chemistry between Helen Hunt and Hanks. But in my second viewing the film's deeper mythic level hit me. Few films go so deeply or for so long into one man's psychic solitude and what he must construct for himself psychologically when isolation and deprivation is imposed upon him. The fall from grace and all that comes after it, the watch, the wings, the burial, Wilsons arrival and departure, the rope back to the raft, the final visit with Kelly. Zemeckis obviously went to the wall for this film. It's not standard Hollywood fare, it takes all the time it needs, which accounts for the slams posted here by those seeking more spectacular mindless fare. No music, just the sounds of the environment. Hanks ain't gussied up either. Well shot, well scripted, well directed, and the elements rage. Hanks is even more brilliant in the final scenes of the movie than he is when left to the mercy of Planet Earth.

Cast Away would be unique opportunity for any great actor, and Hanks sinks his teeth into this. Sorry Gump fans. Forrest Gump doesn't hold up as well to repeated viewings. Hank's Gump character work starts feeling forced in a few scenes. His Chuck Noland in Cast Away is perfect and natural and shows him once again at the top of his game. 2000 Oscar goes to Hanks, not to Russel Crowe - my vote.

It stays with you long after the film has ended. Just go see it, you won't be disappointed.

26 January 2001,High drama: compulsory viewing!,"This is a very well made, intense experience, and for a lot of it's running time, basically a one actor film (though the volleyball Wilson provides staunch support!). Tom Hanks' performamce is stunning, entirely believable. The movie begins slowly, but then comes the crash which leaves Hanks stranded, and, even though I was expecting it, when it came it was terrifying; it was also brilliantly filmed, as was the movie all the way through. There were some gripping and drenching sequences, especailly the scene where Hanks jerks out a bad tooth with the blade of an ice skate. Some other highlights besides Hanks performance included Wilson, who injected just that little more into the movie. The downside was probably the ending, drifting into some romantic scenes between Hanks and Helen Hunt, and a very unfinished final scene! That said, the romantic scenes I just mentioned were very moving; once you've been drenched from your strength by three quarters of the film, then you're drenched from your emotions by the last quarter! The feeling of loneliness on the island where Hanks is stranded is acute. At 2 and a half hours long, this is a very draining movie to watch, but very worth while! Go and see it whenever you can!",9
1 July 2001,This one bit the big one!,"I don't know what I was expecting,but whatever it was this movie sure didn't live up to expectations. As a fan of Tom Hanks,I must say this is right there with ""The Burbs"" as his worst film. Next time I want to see something about a person/people stranded on a deserted island,I'll turn on Gilligan's Island! Robert Zemeckis did a much better job on ""What Lies Beneath"".

19 October 2002,Stark soundtrack,"Much has been made of a few elements of this movie: the importance of the volleyball; the extended period in which Tom Hanks is the sole character (except for his schizophrenic conversations with Wilson); the package he returns at the end.

However, what struck me most about this film was the score--or, more accurately, the lack of it. There are some standard pieces during the beginning segment (Elvis tunes, Russian symphonic/choral pieces, Christmas songs) but otherwise, there's no incidental music for about the first 1 1/2 hours of the movie, and no music at all during the extended island sequence. The first real appearance of the score is when Chuck leaves the island and reaches the open sea. Even more remarkable is that the score stops during large portions of the credits, for just a recording of the pounding surf.

In short, this movie is almost as short on score as Shindler's List was on color. Good movie, and one that dares to break with some of Hollywood's most sacred conventions. Zemekis is a rebel.

4 July 2001,Product Placement.,"This movie had a few moments of decency but overall, I'd say that it really wasn't worth the rental fee. I could swear the first half hour of this film was a Fed Ex training film. I'm not really sure this movie goes twenty minutes without the words ""Fed Ex"" being present somewhere. When he does become stranded, the movie does in fact pick up a bit. I did like the lack of much dialogue or soundtrack during these scenes, that was effective in relaying his feeling of isolation. The fact he does go a little nuts was also appreciated. When he finally gets home however....ugh. I don't think the melodrama was needed, nor well done at that. I also thought Tom Hanks' character took things a little too well, after all, this is a man who earlier risked his life almost drowning trying to save a volleyball. It's hard to believe he'd take the woman he loved marrying another so well. This could have been a lot better. I personally would have wanted something a little darker.

12 June 2001,2 words describe this movie: Tom Hanks,"Another outstanding performance by the greatest actor of our day. He takes a movie that would have not been much of a story and totally makes it a masterpiece. I give Zemekis a bit of the credit, but lets see him do the same with, say, George Clooney or some other mediocre actor out there. Helen Hunt didn't really add too much to the movie. I thought she had better chemistry with Hanks as a photo than she did in the scenes together (or was that done on purpose?). It did bother me that the movie was a 2 1/2 hour commercial for Fedex, but I suppose it could have been worse (I actually enjoyed the dig that was made at the expense of the US Postal Service). While there may be some that feel that the movie is weak in parts, they would say that Hanks saves the day and keeps this ship from sinking. I suppose if at all possible, I would have cast Meg Ryan instead of Helen Hunt (but then it's too much like You've Got Mail/Sleepless but in reality it might be a bit closer to Joe vs. the Volcano). Bottom line: Tom Hanks steals the show and makes a good film an excellent one.

4 August 2001,Eerie kind of movie ..,"The major feeling I got throughout this movie was one of loneliness (which is quite understandable and obvious I suppose)....

It's a human nature verse adverse circumstances type of movie...(not for fans of action and violence)...

I have to say that I thought it was pretty good...It had a realistic feel throughout the film...but the down-sides for me were the ridiculously explicit brand advertisements that went on ,Fed-ex etc (even on a remote island) and the fact that you only ever see a beach on the island along with a cave.... (what about the other side? There may have been a five star holiday resort and Tom didn't even know it)...

Worth a look (but spoiled by the ludicrous advertising)....

The crash scene is the only one worths seeing. Moscow episodes are absolute shameless trash. Watching Forrest Gump will give you the same amount of Mr. Hanks but much more pleasure even if you do it for the 10th time in a row. Pure waste of time and money.

24 February 2003,what about?,"You know you wonder about certain things sometimes like what to buy? What to wear? Where to go for vacation? But who would of thought that this would happen? A fedex employee would be stuck on an island forced to live with himself and of all these choices he must choose between life and death? Do you see where this is going? Robinson Curuso was a real man who was shipwreched and in many of the same situations as our good friend Mr. Tom Hanks found himself as a character involved in. If you are reading this thinking I hated this film you should know that I really did enjoy it. I felt it was a great job by Tom Hanks to be going solo on screen with no one around but himself. The greatest asset one has is themself. He did a great job in making us feel like ""Wilson"" was a real life character and might as well have won best supporting actor for his role in the film! One should be advised that this is a long movie with alot of solo acting done by Tom Hanks. But does anybody really know it is a Robert Zemeckis film? The same man who did ""Back to the Future"" and ""Forrest Gump"" just to name a few. I look forward to even more Robert Zemeckis' films!

15 January 2001,Bad ending ruined this movie,"This movie had the potential to be a truly great film; however, I felt the ending was so bad that it completely ruined the film for me. It was clear to me neither the director nor the writer knew what they wanted to do with the protagonist when he gets home. Despite the fact that (plot revelation coming)Chuck makes it home, this film seems almost completely void of hope and happiness. The audience not even rewarded with the recipient receiving the package.

Much of this film is amazing. The plane crash is incredible, and watching Chuck struggle to stay alive is incredible as well. Tom Hanks, once again reminds everyone in Hollywood that he is at the top of his profession.

It probably would have been better ending with Chuck (Hanks) being rescued, rather than him standing at some a literal and metaphoric crossroads. It just rang hollow to me and absolutely made the film completely average.

In my opinion this is a film that is just screaming out to be rented. Don't waste $8 when you can rent it in a few months for 4$ or less.",6
4 January 2001,"Good, but Disappointing","What saves this film is good acting. There is no real plot, very little dialog, and the story depends entirely on our ability to believe Hanks's character.

I've heard and read a lot about the ending being disappointing, but little as to why. The reason has to do with the fact that they telegraph the ending near the beginning, when Hanks decides not to open a particular FedEx package because of the hand-drawn design on the outside. That in itself, for me, was extremely hard to swallow. A man or woman fighting for survival will use ANY means, and so many of the other packages (virtually every one of them) had something he could use.

And so, I ask myself, why are we left to wonder at the end what was in the package? Has the screenwriter no sense of irony? Are we supposed to believe that a pair of wings drawn on a package represent some sort of guardian angel metaphor? Thin. VERY thin.

It it weren't for Hanks (and yes, Hunt, whose smallish part was just as brilliant as Hanks's) bringing sheer brute-strength acting skills so this film, it would have little to recommend it.

The fact that I was disappointed by an ending they revealed so early in the film is why I couldn't give it a high rating. Filmmaking, after all, is about story telling, not just about acting. The story suffered, and so by extension, so did the movie.

In summary, I found it, overall, to be emotionally unsatisfying.

22 December 2000,Best Picture of 2000,"By far this is the best film of 2000. Tom Hanks ranks up there with the classic actors of yesteryear. Just when you thought he could not top his last film, Tom does it again. This time Tom pretty much has the entire film on his shoulders. This thought provoking film is incredible, it makes you feel as though you are alone on the island, you only have the knowledge in your head to survive, and a will or reason to live. Cast Away is a bit lengthy but you never realize it. Also the movie is filmed beautifully in both Russia and the Fiji Islands. I would like to see the survivors on Survivor the tv show live out a life like what is portrayed in this movie. This is true survivorship. Not even the Swiss Family Robinson or Gilligan's Island had it this rough. This is a must see movie for anyone.

30 June 2001,Very shallow,"I thought this movie was very shallow. I had just finished reading Robinson Crusoe. When Crusoe was stranded on the island, he ponders many deep subjects- the meaning of life, his standing with God. He learns to cultivate crops, tame animals, and eventually frees a savage from cannibals. Hanks's character, by contrast, talks with a volleyball. Give me a break!

23 June 2001,Just Alright.,"I was very excited to see this movie. I cursed people at BlockBuster for getting the last copy, and I harassed the clerks there by phone and in person. I expected an amazing movie, one which would leave me satisfied and content. And while I didn't hate this movie, I was left very disappointed, and not at all content.

This movie was a Tom Hanks movie. And, I don't mean he was the leading man, I mean, if you don't like Tom Hanks (my boyfriend doesn't), don't see this movie.

Tom Hanks is an amazing actor, and he shows it in this film. A very many scenes took place without dialogue, and he carries it off by displaying his feelings in facial expression and body language. This part of the film impressed me greatly. However, the plotline once Hanks is saved from the island really left something to be desired. Without giving too much away, I will say that the story seemed to become very tense and not at all what most of the viewers I've spoken to wanted from it. A movie of this magnitude should carry with it a great ending. An ending which makes the whole of the movie make sense, and injects the whole project with meaning and resolve. Instead, I felt the ending to this was weak. I kept saying to myself, ""Don't fade to black, don't fade to black"". It faded to black.

I just think it could have been done better.",7
4 June 2002,Why not only Tom Hanks needs somebody else on that island,"The film is really the Tom Hanks show! He's alone on that island, he's a survivor! He resists over 4 years on that desert island (I don't think anybody except Patrick De Gayardon could make it!) and the film has no plot, no dialogues and it's terribly boring for the public hearing only ""splash splash"" for more or less 1 hour. What about two survivors on that island? Well, maybe Tom Hanks would have not been nominated to Academy Awards, but maybe we could have heard at least a complete phrase in that empty hour! The audience needed dialogues, not only Tom Hanks on the desert island!

31 January 2001,And best supporting role goes to...,"It's a bit hard to know where to start with this film, what to expect, when the film gets rolling. It's about a guy stranded on a desert island... You're not expecting therefore a lot of action such as Crouching Tiger or deep, meaningful conversations on deep and meaningful things. As far as the acting goes, Tom Hanks is very good, portraying the 'time is money' Fed Ex man who finds his whole life literally crashing down. The island was clever and very beautiful.

The story was a bit long though. There were points when you thought 'ah yes another 5 minutes and we'll be out' and then an added 15 is shown, with the ending being slightly to cliché.

As for the others, Helen Hunt is good as the wife who lost her husband and especially for Wilson, the volleyball! Astounding screen presence, delivers lines with pinpoint accuracy and does his own stunts, definitely a supporting role nomination.

If you want to see a film of a man sitting on the island, or you are a big fan of Tom Hanks, this film is worth seeing. Don't expect a lot of high drama and action though, after all, there is a limit to the amount of stunts you can do with a volleyball...",
25 December 2000,Shed a tear for a vollyball...,"Cast Away is not a fast paced movie. Rather, it is a picture blessed with delicate forms of pristine scenery and stunning environments, all which invite the camera to slowly creep through an array of long, extended takes. In this sense, the film invites the audience to revel in simple beauty, even when cast away to a remote island, in the middle of nowhere, in a desperate quest for survival.

Yet, the survival presented by the movie is not one reminiscent of Golding's Lord of the Flies. It is a different brand of individual exploration, in which a brilliantly prepared Hanks guides the audience on a dramatic journey from the high ground of establishment, to absolute desolation, and back up again...with several surprises on the way.

Again, this is a rather slow paced movie. But it absolutely hinges on the acting prowess of Hanks, who will keep you glued to the screen, as he illustrates a transcendence back to primal nature - struggling to adapt at the most basic level of existence.

In what is essentially a one-man performance, Hanks (with the obvious help of Zemekis' brilliant direction and Burgess' elegant cinematography) creates an uncanny relationship with a lush, tropical island. You will undoubtedly forget, nor be able to refute, the powerful, metaphoric similarities to the glaring realities of modern life that exist on this island. Not only do they prove to be dramatic, but charming and hilarious as well.

Overall, I should admit that no other group of filmmakers and actors could have made me so emotionally attached a volleyball! But this film did, hands down. See it, and find out what I mean for yourself. 9.9/10",
23 December 2000,Another confusing ending for Zemeckis (probable spoilers)!,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",
1 January 2001,mildly entertaining,"Once again the hype is better than the film. The movie did keep my interest, but I thought it was a little slow. I enjoyed watching how he survived the island, and the emotions that went with it, but that was the best part of the movie. I felt that once he got back, the movie fell apart. Way too shallow there, and not very realistic. And how many times can a guy say he is sorry about stuff that isn't his fault?????? The ending was way too pat and dry.

The simple story, about a man's adventures stranded on a desert island, becomes an incredible drama that makes you feel for its characters. Oscars all around! Best Movie of the Year!

28 December 2000,"A fascinating failure, less than the sum of its parts.","If ever a movie was less than the sum of its parts, this is it.

This feels like three separate films within a movie, and as the trailer makes it clear that the Tom Hanks character gets off the island, I don't think I'm giving anything away to say that this trio consists of pre-Island, on-the-Island, and post-Island.

The first segment is the best, with Hanks giving a charming and relaxed performance as a Fedex employee on the job in Moscow and at home in the States with friends. The plane crash that ends this preface to the story is brilliantly done.

The middle segment is itself divided once again by a ""Four Years Later"" flash-forward where we see the formerly chubby and clean-shaven Mr. Hanks now svelte and hirsute, and with his island companion Mr. Wilson. There's a memorable scene in a cave that rivals Marathon Man in its depiction of the horrors of tooth pain and rudimentary dentistry.

But the final segment just doesn't pack the emotional wallop it's supposed to, and the casting of Helen Hunt, perhaps the most over-exposed, over-used, and over-rated of American actresses doesn't help.

Ironically, for a movie whose central theme is time, it is time itself that ultimately seems to defeat this film. That is, two hours is not sufficient (or wasn't with this approach, anyway) to do justice to the beginning, middle, and end of this particular story. As a result, the ending feels a little tacked-on.

All in all, a movie I'm glad I saw, but ultimately a disappointment given its pedigree.",6
23 January 2001,Great film. Pity about the ending though ...,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",
7 January 2001,Great Movie!,"Yet another spectacular performance by our hero Tom Hanks. This movie makes you realize how valuable life really is. This movie is about a Fedex employee who is the only survivor of a plane crash. He is stuck on an island for 4 years without anybody except Wilson, the volleyball. This movie is great, but there are a few scenes that might be disturbing to younger audiences.

20 January 2001,a 2 1/2 hour promo for FedEx,"A survival story of an average guy stranded on a deserted island. Tom Hanks is the perfect actor to play this part and the audience is only too happy to spend an hour with him alone on an island, cracking coconuts and making fire. I was impressed with how the screenwriter avoided the cliches so common in survival stories -- for instance, when Hanks crashes at sea during a storm he doesn't simply wake up the next morning, washed ashore on the beach. Instead, during the middle of the night and the storm, he has to crawl on top of a coral reef. The story should probably have ended with Hank's rescue, because the audience's interest runs aground once he makes his way back to civilization. The resolution with Helen Hunt, his former fiancee, is overlong, fitful and unsatisfying. Worst of all, the ending where Hanks delivers the FedEx package he refused to open in his 4 years on the island was downright absurd. (Newsflash to Hanks -- there might have been food in that package!) The big winner for this movie has to be Federal Express. Next time I send a Wilson volleyball to Russia you can be sure I'll use their service.",5

10 March 2001,A great film,"Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away is one of the best films I've seen for a long time. Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance as Chuck Noland, a Federal Express worker who leaves Memphis, for a short time to go overseas on business. Before leaving, he tells his girlfriend Kelly ( Helen Hunt), ""I'll be right back"". What happens next is extraordinary filmmaking: Chuck's plane crashes, and Chuck is the sole survivor, finding himself cast ashore on a deserted island. These scenes are the greatest in the film, for we see Hanks trying to adjust to island life, and having as his only companion, a volleyball which he calls ""Wilson"". There are a few funny scenes in Cast Away. I laughed at the scenes in which the Federal Express boxes were cast ashore, which were full of rollerskates, videotapes, and of course the volleyball. But the main point of Cast Away is the drama of trying to adjust to life, both on the island and when he gets back home. Whatever you do, just see this film at least once.

3 August 2001,Outstanding.,"The difficulty of carrying an entire movie alone must be tremendous... Yet Tom Hanks succeeds in Cast Away. This modern, high tech retelling of the man on desert island tale is outstanding in every way. Wonderful acting, excellent direction, and ,despite its simplicity, an engaging story. Also, some interesting themes about fast paced, modern life. Pretty much everything has already been said about this movie, but I want to recommend seeing this one on DVD! There are many many extras that add insight to the film. For example, in Robert Zemeckis' alternate audio track, he tells you that Fed Ex paid nothing to be put into this film, but that it had been a part of the story line from day one because it fit so well with the way they wanted the Chuck Noland character to be... I found that reassuring after hearing so many friends said the movie was a Fed Ex commercial... Anyway, go for the DVD version... if you have a good surround sound system, you will really be able to appreciate the excellent sound effects which are another big part of carrying this film.

25 December 2000,"Not that great of a movie, worth one watch","Not that bad of a movie. After the initial crash and about one-half hour of being stranded, it became a very dry movie. The sappy ending didn't do that much for me either. I think that the plot of the movie could have been better, and they could have done a great deal more with it. Special effects and everything were excellent, however, which makes it worth one watch.

14 May 2021,Survival,"This movie has taught us no matter the circumstances, the will to succeed can turn the tide in any situation. Hope, no matter how small, is the pinnacle of human evolution and the director does just that. Exceptional performance by Tom Hanks in the lead role, Marvelous location and cinematography and top direction. This may not be the best directorial venture of Robert (Which I believe to be Forrest Gump) however, it does shine as one the best survival movies and perhaps the best movie of 2000. However, I think the ending could have been improved a bit with perhaps 3 - 4 minutes of runtime towards the end showing Hanks resuming his duties, getting over the memories of his previous relationship and striking a new one with the end-parcel-lady.

19 August 2002,"Finally it's here, a two-and-a-half hour FedEx Commercial","I personally hold the opinion that Tom Hanks is an over rated actor. I must admit that I haven't seen the Road to Perdition (it's not even out in Australia yet) a performance that apparently may change my mind. He has put in one truly great performance in his career, that being Philadelphia, his other major triumph was Forrest Gump, which was only really a good performance in a great movie. I personally liked him better in his earlier roles such as Joe versus the Volcano and the Burbs, back before he'd developed as an unmistakable presence in a film. The success of this film depended almost entirely on how the audience responded to Hanks. According to the poll I just voted in, the response was nothing short of remarkable. Not just that it made so much money, but also that no one seemed to notice that Wilson the volleyball seemed to have more of a personality than did Hanks' character. (OK, That one is a blatent lie, but I had to use it)

It's all the more remarkable if one considers that the entire film is one big commercial for Federal Express. A kind of cross between 'The Postman' and 'Robinson Crusoe'. They spend the first 20 minutes or so telling us how reliable the service is. Then we learn that the mail is so securely bound as to not become redundant and useless when it falls out of a plane into salt water and floats there for a few days. The real clincher is the film's final scene when Hanks' character actually delivers a package that he has been saving over the four years that he has been stranded on a desert island for.

Federal Express: Not even we can deliver this film from mediocrity.",
11 December 2000,Great Movie!!,"This movie is a real thriller!! I went to the movie premier in Hollywood, on Dec. 7... It was a very suspenseful movie... It makes you appreciate the human spirit... It will make you laugh, cry, and really think about the everyday things in life we take for granted.... I met the star himself! The movie, and the premier were a great experience!

30 January 2012,Good film!,"I have never seen a more meaningful and thought-provoking film. Right from the start, I knew this was going to be a classic film, and my opinion was not changed throughout the course of the movie one bit. It delivers such a strong message of fear, survival and hope, that leaves your mind devoted to thinking about it for a long while after. It made me think about all my creature comforts, and what is actually necessary in life. Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic! I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film, maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV, but anyway, it sort of made you guess how he was feeling, in a clever way. This is one of my all time favourite films, and I could watch it again and again without getting bored... so go and watch it...NOW!!

1 January 2001,A Great movie that could have been Excellent except for...,"...one scene where the words ""FOUR YEARS LATER"" appear, in my opinion that's what can seperate a good director from a great director. If done well the audience should not have to be told it is 4 years later... we should already know it... again that is just my opinion, otherwise kudos to Tom for making this another ""Must See"" film. I was sitting in a theater getting ready to watch MEN OF HONOR, another good one, when the trailer for Cast Away came on, and I remember sitting there captured by the clips of the plane crash (I agree with another viewer, they did give too much of the movie away) and saying I have to see this.

Huge credit goes to Wilson, of course, ""someone"" I am sure we can all relate. I admired Tom's desire to get Wilson back and then making a conscious decision to give up the fight and move on... that was a very powerful momment... a very final momment that was beautifully done. I am glad Wilson did not wash up on shore, to me it would have decreased the impact of the significant role Wilson played.

All the scenes done without dialogue were excellent. You could here a pin drop in the theatre. Tom does a great job at telling a story without words. The shoe scene was FUNNY.. I think it was meant to be funny. Kind of makes you not want to take off your shoes in an airplane, which goes against Bruce Willis' theory about dealing jetlag (DIEHARD)

Overall a great movie and while I wasn't knocked out of socks about the ending I did appreciate the ""realness"" of it. The movie is worth the time spent... and finally it may be just me but I am not to sure I would be ready for another airplane that quick after what happened. But again, that's just my opinion.",9
13 January 2001,Not at the top of this year's class.,"This movie is worth seeing because of Tom Hanks' stellar performance. However, the movie is nothing special other than that. Helen Hunt still plays the same character in every role, not that her role is that big. The island story is a retread. The only thing Oscar worthy is Hanks.

23 December 2000,An amazing film experience...,"I just saw this film on its opening day and I must say that this film struck me in a way very few films have. ""Cast Away"" is remarkable for its power to make you think about isolation away from everything you have. Isolation from your loved ones, human contact, and even the everyday things we all unknowingly take for granted. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Chuck Noland, a man so obsessed with not wasting time, that, ironically, his whole life is passing him by. Chuck is a troubleshooter for FedEx who has to check his schedule before he can even schedule family events or a date with his fiancee Kelly Frears (a sweet, affecting Helen Hunt). While on a Christmas Eve emergency trip to Malaysia to save a FedEx operation, Chuck's small plane crashes and leaves him stranded on an island in the South Pacific where his only companionship is a volleyball that washed ashore. Chuck's emotional and physical journey begins on that small island. Tom Hanks turns in one of his best performances ever. ""Cast Away"" is a film that makes you feel nothing but gratitude for your life. It is a film that will break your heart. It was so emotionally effecting for me. It is a beautiful film.

Tom Hanks is one a FedEx plane to Malaysia and crashes and finds a package from this same women from Texas. Now while its possible that this artist sends her work via FedEx worldwide, what are the chances of her sending one package to Russia where Tom happens to be that day AND sending one to Malaysia on a flight he happens to be on!

Well having seen the movie, I still feel I cannot answer those questions. They showed how life was tough and that is it. It was tough on the island and it was tough when he got back. That is how it ended. I was waiting for something significant to happen 2:20 into the movie. Maybe in return to cast away Island? ha ha

8 January 2001,FedEx: The Movie.,"I rarely find myself going so far as to comment on a film here, yet after seeing the rave reviews this film has been getting, I found I could not help myself.

What people see in this movie, I am not really sure. Perhaps it is just the casting of Hanks and Hunt, or some bit of hype which has built up....

From the start one of the most annoying things was the MASSIVE product placement of FexEx through out the movie. Half of the movie was basically a giant advertisement for FedEx. You could see logos everywhere. The scene when Hank returns and is waiting to see Hunt and looks out the window to the parking lot to see her in a fit---with about 20 FexEx planes strangely in the background was especially bad.

And one knows since FexEx most surely paid a lot of money to get their name and logo everywhere and anywhere, that not a single harsh word (or should I say harsh even? perhaps not even a Realistic word) would be said against them.

As for the rest of the film, it seems the whole film is basically given away in the title: Cast Away. It is almost as if someone came up with the title and then proposed they make a film about it and some how found some way to Cast him away and bring him back, all nice and neat and pretty.

The period of time which Hank spends on the island is basically meaningless, and while he does struggle and learn, in the end nothing has really changed. He finally makes it back home, and some how returns back to ""normal"" life quite quickly with little readjustment. (if one was on a stranded island for 4 years, coming home would be one hell of a bizarre proposition).

The love interest seems to be included very much for the sake of simply having one, or at least giving Hanks something to DO when he gets back, with out which there would be nothing to show us.

So the film tries to give us the passion, but showing how much they still ""love"" each other-- yet god forbid they make an ""immoral"" movie where a woman runs away from her family to be with a previous lover-- So they attempt to show us that the desire is still there, but desire is grounded by practicality, and so life moves on (now that sounds pretty dull to me.)

In any case, there were a few scenes on the island I thought were interesting, yet over all I hardly feel this movie deserves the reviews it has gotten.",3
15 January 2001,The title is 2 words.,"I didn't catch it until I looked at the poster after I saw the film. The director, ""Dr.Z"", is a genius for giving a bizarre quasi-sequel to Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks as Gump meets all these people through out history with little effort and takes part in the entire U.S. experience - Chuck Noland is a man that has to do with everyone, 6 degrees wise, with everyone in the world (he's with FedEx). Then is not connected with another human soul. His wonderful kaleidescope of people and places take place on a microcosim of himself. In the time he is away the things like Strife (Surviving & War), friends (Wilson & Bubba), and redemption (Jenny & Kelly) happen as can be seen on Nolan's appearance.

Dr.Z has always shown us stories of infinite contact and communication of the human spirit whether through time, space, etc. and now the human spirit of isolation. Surviving one's self is ultimate to the human experience. One who is Cast Away is banished, or forced not into nothing - but onto oneself (for better or worse). This is what this Movie is at. Go Dr. Z!!!!

P.S. Wilson can also be seen as stife since friends and family are like blood and so is Wilson if you get down to it. Who else do you bleed for?",
31 January 2001,Not as fun as......,"When you think of being stranded, stuck on a tropical island, what do you think of? Of course, Gilligan! We are forever stuck with the hilarious memories of Gilligan and the gang from childhood (if not even today with the eternal reruns). If you were lucky, you may even remember the time the gang got off the island and returned to civilization. The rescue was hilarious, Gilligan tried to make a barbeque on the raft. The fire and smoke attracted a boat and Wham, they're saved. After returning home, none could properly adjust back to their normal lives, personal, social, and career. Perhaps that 's my bias with Cast Away, this movie is totally stuck on Tom Hanks the ""survivor"" than Chuck the person.

I know Hanks did a supurb job acting. Robert Z did a great job directing, the supporting cast did a supurb job supporting, blah , blah, blah. But what credibility and imagination did this movie feature? What insight and introspective to the human psyche? I'd like to make one up, but find myself scratching my head thinking, well at least he survived and he'll ""keep breathing"" (or whatever he said). Gee, what a shocker, why don't Helen Hunt marry an alcoholic and then we'll see what ""keep breathing"" really means. I mean, she lives in a nice flat with a chance to get a doctorate...that's not ""keep breathing"", it's ""I'm happily married to YOUR dentist!!""

Dealing with adversity is one thing, acting as if it's just an obstacle is another. If I found out MY girlfriend married another person, I'd go nuts, even if everyone in the entire world thought I was gone. I'd cry and destroy my 4X4. But Hanks gave a subverted performance that just displayed a ""wow, you kept my car in great shape....can I have it back..."" Totally cool, totally cold.

I rated this movie a 5. With ANY actor besides Hanks, it would've gotten a 5. Leo, Cuba Gooding Jr., Woody Harrleson, etc. , but with Hanks, we all gave it a 7, right?? Admit it, you went to see it for Hanks. You said it was great cause of Hanks, You recommended it to friends cause of Hanks. hanks could do no wrong and you would feel no wrong.",7
15 June 2001,Falls little short of a masterpeice.,"What would you do if everything you use to make your daily life easier was all taken away.

26 January 2001,Great Movie,"I went to see Cast Away after an awful day and work and it kept me focused on the movie plot for the entire time. The whole crash scene was lengthy but seemed authentic and I was already rooting for Hanks to get away from the plane engine and into the raft safely.

Making fire is at least as hard as it looked on film and I teach firebuilding to Girl Scout leaders!

The ending was also good--not just the woman left at home waiting and doing nothing until his return.

Tom Hanks's acting was great and this is what ""Survivor"" should really be like.

14 April 2006,cast away,"I am a boy of Port De Bouc, near Marseilles in France. I am 16 years old and I am a schoolboy. I give my opinion to you on what I think of film. To excuse me if I make spelling mistakes because I am French and I handle not too well the English. I saw this film, I have enjoyed it. The topic of film very is successful. The positive side is that it is funny, the story is interesting. To dimension negative films is that I find that there is not enough special effects. For me it is too ordinary a topic. What I want to say is that everyone can direct it and that it is not extraordinary.

I you it recommend nevertheless for those who have not seen it because it is interesting.

9 April 2001,Hollywood moviemaking at its best,"I love it when Hollywood proves me wrong. Here I am, a huge proponent of independent cinema as the last bastion of quality filmmaking left in America. But I have to admit, it is such a good feeling to walk out of a multiplex after seeing a Hollywood movie that is finely crafted by intelligent professionals, with production value afforded by the financial support of a major studio, and yet so full of truth and love. By any standards, Hollywood or Indie, Cast Away is a smart movie that is courageous enough to challenge its audience. I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to pitch this idea to a studio executive.

Exec: Lemme get this straight, for the whole second act of this picture, we only get to watch one actor? How are we gonna get dialogue out of that?

Writer: That's the point, you see? There won't be any dialogue. This is a movie about the loneliest guy on earth.

Exec: Are you kidding me? The average Joe Moviegoer won't go near a picture that doesn't have any dialogue in it.

Writer: Um, yeah.... Did I mention that we also don't want there to be any music while he's on the island...?

I'm of the opinion that the only way this movie could have been greenlit is if the greatest actor in the world was attached to star. And indeed he was. While there are many great actors in the world, none of them have the same Everyman affection, the Nice Guy appeal, or the Movie Star clout as Mr.Tom Hanks. He's the only actor in the world who could carry a film like this by himself. And it is such a joy to watch his mind work through challenge after challenge after challenge on the island.

Watching this movie just makes you feel good. As much as I say it challenges the audience, it is also dramatically satisfying and thematically reassuring. We are presented with a story of man vs. nature, reminiscent of romantic classics such as Robinson Crusoe. And by watching his struggles and witnessing the difficult lessons he learns upon his homecoming, the movie delivers one of those universal truths that we never get tired of hearing. This is Hollywood moviemaking at its best.

7 January 2001,Wrung Out...,"Whew! What a film. I just got back from seeing ""Cast Away"", and I'm not quite able to put into words what I'm feeling right now. Suffice it to say that it was probably the most uniquely engaging film experience I have ever had at the movies. I never thought that a film with such a scarcity of dialogue through the central portion of the film could provoke such an emotional response from me, but this film pays off in buckets. When Tom Hanks' character felt pain, I felt it. When he experienced jubilation, I was right there with him. Additionally, the absence of a soundtrack score through a lot of the film enhances the experience that the main character goes through, and this minimalist approach forces the audience to focus on the bare essentials just as he does.

There seemed to be 3 distinct movements to the film, and the final movement I think might have been the most poignant, all due to the previous sections of the film. Without giving anything away, just know that when the final scene fades you feel a subtle elation that things turned out the way they did.

Also, the scene in the airplane earlier in the film treats you as if you're a passenger. Hanks' character never really knows what is happening or why it is happening, only that something is horribly wrong. Again, no music on the soundtrack, no additional dramatic flair, just a harrowing experience of the sort that I continue to fear whenever I have to fly somewhere. (On reflection, this scene probably wasn't good for me, and I hope I conveniently forget it!)

This film did not evoke too many tears for me during the actual duration of it (although it had some very real moments that I can't forget), but what it did do was leave me sorting out the details long after it was over. If a movie can do that, it was more than worth the price of a ticket. This one does, and is.",
17 January 2001,"Saw it, was okay, wanted to FedEx something.","Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away.

Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball).

5 January 2001,Good Movie but overhyped,"First of all I want to spank to the people that promoted this movie. The preview featured music from Braveheart. Great, but please don't do it again. We all now that James Horner achieved his maximum in Braveheart but that doesnt mean that everybody has to use the music in all previews. Remember, Titanic also used Braveheart's music in the preview. I guess that because the music is so nice they'll get more people to see the movie. Anyway, for a movie that didnt promise too much, a castaway lost in his pacific island for two hours, I have to admit that Cast Away surprised me. I didnt find the movie boring at all because there are a lot of humor in it, and you get along with Tom Hanks role. But besides from that I don't think this movie is by far the best of the year. Its a good movie, but I don't think it could be better.

25 June 2001,good but with one flaw,"A good film but would have been better if, instead of Hanks, the late Terry-Thomas played the lead. Instead of going crazy he would have sat back and made very droll comments on his situation, trying desperately to keep his tea time intact and his clothes in presentable fashion. I like Tom Hanks but boy did he miss the mark by casting himself.

25 December 2001,"Superb Acting, Thin Story, Great Portrayal of Memphis","As a native of Memphis, I am thrilled that my hometown was (accurately) portrayed as a modern city where people don't live in manufactured housing nor talk as though they'd walked off the set of ""Hee Haw"". Contrast that with the treatment of Memphis in John Grisham's ""The Client"" and ""The Firm"".

I enjoyed the first section of the movie -- the scenes set in Russia and in Memphis. Director Robert Zemeckis gave an adequate overview on the fast-paced lives and dreams of Chuck (Tom Hanks) and Kelly (Helen Hunt).

For the first part of his island stay, I was interested in watching Chuck survive using the various items at his disposal. While some scenes were quite interesting, many of the island scenes were very tiring to watch. I am normally appreciative of a good long film (Kubrick's 2001 is a favorite of mine), but there were many scenes that could have been cut out without abandoning the plot. My wife and I deliberated on hitting the fast-forward button on the DVD player many times during the island scenes.

The ending portion of the movie was indeed emotional, but largely a waste of film. Zemeckis put forth too much effort in exhibiting the emotional sides of the characters in the final 20 minutes, and didn't bother with the task of actually coming up with a conclusion. From the beginning of the Memphis homecoming scene to the end of the movie, the story is at a standstill. Zemeckis could have better used this time to give the audience a better insight into what Chuck plans for his future instead of turning it into a big pity-party. Zemeckis could have even tacked on an extra half-hour to show Chuck's reimmersion into life in Memphis.

Acting-wise, this was the Tom Hanks Show and Hanks was outstanding. Helen Hunt was her usual mediocre self -- slightly better than Wilson the Volleyball -- and nowhere near her excellent performance in As Good As It Gets.

On a personal note, one message I gathered from this movie is to not take what you have for granted. Chuck had to re-invent fire and become friends with a volleyball to cover his basic needs for warmth, food, and companionship. Always be appreciative of your loved ones. Instead of putting in that extra few hours at the workplace, spend that time with your family. You'll be very glad you did.",5
12 December 2001,"""Cast Away"" not as shallow as it could have been","Pointless soliloquy of Tom Hanks (the only actor for half the film) as a Fed-Ex worker stranded on some island after his plane wrecks. Movie is interesting, and beautiful to marvel at, but never really adds up to much. Although his character is in good standing, and his screen presence charismatic, we've heard of all this before. Still great entertainment.

I am a great fan of Hanks, and tremendously enjoyed Forest Gump and Apollo 13. However a word of warning firstly! Don't go to see this movie if you are flying any time soon. That part of the film was well done, i.e. the crash scene.

I was expecting great things of this movie, as it had an all star cast of Hanks and Helen Hunt. It was an average movie and rather disappointing as they could have made a lot more of the plot possibilities. There were alot of open ends, the movie was slow. They don't seem to have made the most of potential plot possibilities. The script seemed rather weak, a pity as Hanks' acting was very good.

You come away from the movie feeling a wee bit cheated. My feeling is okay, go and see it, but its not something I would rave about

23 December 2000,Too many questions left unanswered,"This movie left too many questions unanswered and was entirely too slow in many places. After his leg was injured so badly on the coral how did it heal? He was shown bandaging it up and no mention was ever made of it again. When he was being rescued by the steamer there were several shots of him on the raft. Absolutely nothing else was on the raft ... however, many scenes later he is shown leaving a FedEx package on the front porch of a farm house. Where did the package come from suddenly??? How did whatever was in the package save his life while he was on the island, and what did that have to do with the plot of the movie .. nothing that I could see. I expected much more from a Tom Hanks movie.

27 December 2000,Tom scores again!!!,"Well, Tom Hanks does it again. He turns in a splendid performance that may very well earn him another Oscar. I'm not sold on that the film is ""Oscar worthy"" but worse performances and films have won before. Expect his popularity to help him to another victory.

Following the outstanding plane crash sequence -- which my wife leaned over to say ""Wow!"" -- Zemekis and crew do a great job. Tom, as Chuck Noland, flounders through the beginnings of abandonment and provides with a laugh here and there. One minute I'm ready to scream out ""Use the belt"", the next, I'm giggling at his cave scribble.

Even his physical transformation was amazing and I wish I had never seen the trailer, for this gave away too much information. It's during this sequence, ""Four years later"", that Hanks reaches that performance excellence which is similar to ""Philadelphia."" Absolutely great.

Lastly, the film really hit the home run ball when it didn't try to spoonfeed me an ending. Just like Tom's character, we are struggling to know how to feel. The comments I've read say that the writer didn't know how to end the film and they felt slighted by the ending. I disagree and ""get"" the ending.

So, in closing, ""continue to breathe and see what the tide brings in.""",8
22 December 2000,Good but ....,"Entertaining movie if you can accept waterlogged packages with dry contents (ink on cards doesn't even smear), no ill effects from being pulled under water then surfacing rapidly (any SCUBA divers in the crowd?), and a current that pulls his raft one way and his ""friend"" another. Otherwise, another great performance from Tom Hanks. Worth a see.

8 February 2001,Watch it at home,"This was by far the best FedEx commercial I have ever seen. As for its merits as a movie; it didn't fare as well. Though it did seem to be one endless FedEx advertisement, Cast Away is not a bad movie but is far from a great one. Tom Hanks gives a decent performance as a luckless FedEx employee stranded on a deserted island but his performance lacks any strong distinguishing characteristics that have become synonymous with Hanks roles (i.e. Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan). The most entertaining character in the film is a volleyball named Wilson who Hanks talks to and eventually befriends. I thought the imaginary friend concept and how Hanks dealt with it was very interesting and made the audience wonder how they would deal with such intense desolation.

The island scenes throughout the body are visually stunning but the beginning and end of the film were a big let down. Wait for it to hit the video store.

22 February 2001,Tom Hanks is great.,"I think this is good picture about human strength and faith. It's faith helped Chuck came back home. He believed in his love and everyday thought about his girlfriend. But life is so fierce, and when he came back home after four years, he understands - his love stayed in the island.

Tom Hanks is great. He showed to us, he is a wonderful actor. A lot of part time in film he plays alone. And only old volleyball ball is his partner. Very interesting to see how Tom talks with that ball. It's funny and sad together at same time. It's the every nice movie. I liked that picture.

23 March 2001,Unusual and good film,"A break from the tradition of formula driven Hollywood movies makes this an interesting and thought provoking film.

The first 20 minutes or so gets a little sickening at times with the obvious product placement, it feels a bit like an overly long Corporate advert for FEDEX. However this does not detract from the overall quality of the film and as the audience has come to expect over the years Tom Hanks is excellent.

I would definitely recommend this film.

This movie's made me in to a Tom Hanks fan because it really did give him the chance to shine. Him and his co star Wilson (the volleyball) work brilliantly together, as well as Helen Hunt who was under used but with Tom Hanks there instead......I know which one I prefer. I must warn you though, if you are flying soon and have a fear of it then don't watch this movie for your own sake. The plane crash is phenomonal and leaves you feeling dizzy and shaken. The last half hour of the movie does let the film's interest slip a bit but not much. 2 and a half hours of non-stop Tom Hanks running around on a beach and talking to his Fed-Ex friend? Desert island bliss!

2 August 2002,A Wise Film,"""Cast Away"" is an interesting film in the first place for a lot of reasons. One being the ever so famous Tom Hanks as the star, 2nd being Robert Zemeckis as the director, 3rd for having an intriguing plot that makes one wonder what really is the fuss behind a Fed Ex guy stranded on a deserted island due to a plane crash.

I really enjoyed watching this movie. It's indeed a worthwhile experience. ""Cast Away"" is a film with wisdom. It shows a lot of metaphors (sometimes with humor) to the truths we go through in life, and the one thing that it points out couldn't be more clearer to me by the time I finished watching the film. This film made me appreciate what life has to offer for me and eventually taught me more reasons why we shouldn't give up in life.

Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis's 2nd collaboration (Forrest Gump being the first one) in this film is an excellent idea. They're both geniuses in their fields. The rest of the cast and crew of ""Cast Away"" also did an excellent job.

Definitely a worthy movie to buy in DVD. Go watch ""Cast Away"" if you still haven't! You'll laugh and maybe you'll cry during the sad scenes, but most importantly, you'll learn.",10

9 August 2023,The tide brought Cast Away in!,"Cast Away is a movie from 2000, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. It tells the story of a manager at FedEx (Chuck, Tom Hanks) who survives a plane crash into the sea and lands on a desert island, where he tries, day by day, to stay alive, hoping to be rescued by someone, somehow, some day.

Cast Away is not only a beautifully portrayed fight-for-survival story, but also an exploration of the human feelings connected to that. Love and loss, hope and desperation, loneliness and company, sorrow and gratefulness take the central role of the movie as the events play out and the viewer stands by Chuck in his fight for survival.

To do that, the movie doesn't only focus on the story on the island, but also takes the time to explore Chuck's everyday life in the time frame before the plane crash as well as the aftermath of the disaster. This is done in a chronological order and gives the movie a well-identifiable three-act kind of structure. While the first and last parts do have important roles in the movie, the dramatic core of the movie is to be found in the central part, where Chuck is alone on the island, and no other actor except Tom Hanks appears on screen. Here, even more than in the rest, he carries the whole movie with an excellent one-man-show performance.

Time passes and Chuck starts to learn how to get food and shelter on the island, kept emotionally alive by the memory of his beloved partner. He also starts talking to Wilson, an imagined character in the form of a volleyball found among the packages which were carried in the plane before the crash that reached the island as well. The relationship with Wilson becomes an important part of his life and a way for Chuck to externalize his thoughts and emotions. Later, Wilson is dropped into the open sea on Chuck's way to freedom, and in the way in which Chuck tries to recover him, we have by far the most intense sequence of the movie. Here, the fact that the viewer is so emotionally connected with this scene, even though what we are seeing is a man trying to recover a ball, tells you about how good of a job this movie does in taking the viewer into this extremely dramatic journey.

Chuck opens all the packages that have landed on the island, looking for useful items which could help him survive and/or look for help, except one, which is left unopen. This symbolizes the hope for him to be back to mainland one day and be able to deliver the package. While this plot point is used toward the end of the movie, I don't think this symbolism worked particularly well, or at least it didn't for me. It is carried further with the logo on the package - angel wings, but this makes it both a bit too obvious and too ambiguous. Why that package in particular? And what if that package could really save his life? Would you really take that chance? It feels a bit too stretched.

The movie is almost 2 and a half hours long and has a quite slow pace. Although this gives the movie a kind of everyday life rhythm, it does get a bit too slow in some parts, where feelings and interactions among the characters (especially Chuck and Kelly) feel a bit too stretched (similarly to the unopened package deal above, in a certain way), and I wished the movie could have moved on to the next part a bit sooner, because the main message was already well delivered. The same applies to the setup, where a lot of time is taken to get to know Chuck, his family, his job and his obsession for punctuality.

Through the dramatic events of the movie, it is interesting to observe Chuck's growth and path. We meet him as a successful FedEx manager, convinced that anything can be done in 87 hours. We leave him as a fragile man, dealing with existential questions and confronting the viewer with topics like time, destiny, on one's mission in life, on the fact that ""tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?"".

Great movie! 8 stars!",8

4 January 2001,Overall very satisfied with this movie,"Wow...what a rush! Can you imagine falling from 30,000 feet to the earth? The crash scene was really intense and Hank's interpretation of the utter helplessness felt by his character was superb. It's amazing how one's mind fixates on something important (gold watch) and one is willing to risk life and limb to obtain this object! It still amazes me how an actor can sacrifice so much while making a film. Hanks had to have lost 30 pounds or more to portray the nearly starved crazy 'Gilligan'. It was a little depressing towards the end when he gets rescued only to find that...well...see for yourself. Overall a very good movie and I would enjoy seeing it again!

1 January 2001,Don't take everything so seriously!!,"I am very disappointed in the reviews I'm reading. Mostly, everyone is complaining about ""product placement"". WHO CARES?? We live in a materialistic world, that is how it works, that's how money is made. No one is going to wake up one day and say, ""Oh my God, I'm making movies that feature prominent companies and products! How can I live with myself?"" No one is going to just wake up and renounce all possessions.

Aside from that, I just want to say that Wilson is the best thing I've seen in a long time. He made me laugh, and I felt he was a very believable character. I don't feel so much that he was even product placement, because he was transformed into so much more. I think it was amazing that they were able to put so much personality and life into a volleyball! I nominate Wilson for Best Supporting Actor!

8 August 2001,Boring! *Spoilers*,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",4
21 August 2001,A movie that became funny,"I think this movie was just boring. You see Tom Hanks getting hurt, you see nothing on the other side of reality and there is no music not one thing. I mean its a movie thats more interpretive and like a spritual film. I rented the movie on dvd and the extra stuff was better than movie. All the movie was Robinson Crusoe (a good book) with a different name and thats it. The movie almost became funny when he started writing help on the beach. But you dont have to take my word for it!

23 December 2000,Had potential,"...but devolved into typical shallow Hollywood fare. There were some really lovely, genuinely moving moments (like when he discovers a fellow passenger who perished in the airplane, when he is completely alone on the raft and is crying)but they were overshadowed by a lack of commitment to REALLY explore human terror and loneliness. They didn't go far enough into the insanity that was only hinted at. I found the stuff with the ball (wilson) annoying if only because it came off as cutesy instead of desperate. I had a hard time believing that he was really stuck on the Island for four years and there was little to help alleviate this feeling. I was far more focused on the knowledge that Tom Hanks had lost all that weight and was thinking of the newspaper articles I had read. The real waste for me is that the filmmakers put their toes in the water at various points in the film which showed that there was the potential for more. Robert Zemeckis should be made to take a page from the Steven Soderbergh handbook to see how you can make Hollywood movies with balls.

3 January 2001,Needed A Little More Work,"Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is a marvelous actor and has a very impressive (and deserved) selection of Academy Awards, but I just wasn't really impressed with a couple things in this film. Hanks' character just wasn't really believable and the script leaves us hanging.

For one, in the script, we seem to make a huge jump in the film when Hanks is stranded on the island. We jump from the first couple of days that he is there to four years later! This leaves a huge gap of time that seems to be forgotten. Sure, we see Hanks now, four years later, looking a lot thinner, bushy hair and a huge ""Harley Davidson"" beard. His survival techniques are a little more skilled, but that's pretty much it.

The second thing that needed a little more work was Tom Hanks' character. He just didn't seem like a man that was stranded on an island. He didn't seem like a man that has left his wife behind. I must say that I was rather shocked to find a Tom Hanks character unbelievable. I thought he was great in the GREEN MILE. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was terrific! He had one of the greatest acting performances I have ever seen in FORREST GUMP. Just about every movie Hanks has done is extraordinary! But he just didn't have me believing that he was actually there.

And lastly, the ending (and I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the film) could have used a little more work as well. It just seemed rather tagged on and very short. Instead of wasting 15 minutes of film on what I thought to be unnecessary footage of Hanks floating in his raft on the ocean in the storm, elaborate on the ending! Don't leave us hanging! We were on that island with Hanks for about over an hour!

I walked away from the film with the same feeling that I did when I saw James Cameron's TITANIC. And that was that I just couldn't find it believable. You know your watching a good movie when you forget that you're watching a movie.

Bottom line: It just needed a little more work.

1 January 2001,Cast Away Is An OK Movie,"I went into this one skeptical because the critics liked it. With the exception of a very few, the movies critics applaud bore me to tears. This one was, in my opinion, a casualty until the crash. Hanks and Hunt walk through their lines in the beginning like they are just punching a time clock saying memorised lines. There is no passionate chemistry between them. In fact they are rather cool to each other not even acting like they like each other really except where it says ""insert kiss here"". The movie does take off however when Hanks boards the doomed flight and soars from then on. The rest of the movie is suspenseful, funny and poignant. Hanks is marvellous in his Robinson Caruso role. Hunt finally finds her emotions at the end and finally the chemistry between Hanks and Hunt is there for the ending. This one fell flat for me in the beginning but soared into the ending with flying colors.

30 June 2001,Zemeckis and Hanks: a Winning Combination!,"In Cast Away, director Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks,

triumph again with a movie which tells a compelling tale about the

human condition. Obviously, the story line is radically different

""Forrest Gump"", and has not quite the nostalgic ""entertainment""

value. In Cast Away Hank plays a man who endures no human

contact for four years, whereas Forrest Gump in his very eventful

life gets the opportunity to interact with a multitude of characters,

many of them famous. However, in both films, as in many others,

Hanks portrays a decent and sensitive man and skillfully gains the

empathy of all but the most cynical audience members. And both

films have bittersweet endings, perhaps ""hokey"" to some but in my

opinion, endings which nicely underline fundamental truths about

the journey of life and its inherent joys, despite the adversities

encountered along the way.

I thought that just about the right amount of time was devoted to

Chuck's life before and after his stay on the island; enough for us

to get to know him in the ""civilized world"" and enough to show the

difficulties (and ironically, the acute loneliness) of his return to that

world.

Although I had some reservations about seeing this film,

wondering if I could endure an hour and half of watching one

character with minimal dialogue, overall I was pleasantly

surprised. Although not a ""perfect"" film (the scene with Helen Hunt

at the end could have been pared down and made a little less

melodramatic), it succeeds in telling a story a lot of directors and

actors would probably be unwilling to risk. Well done!",8
11 February 2001,Good but falls short of Oscar,"This movie would have been so much better with some scenes of what Chuck's friend and girlfriend were going through over the four years he was on the island, like what their lives were like, scenes of the events of her life (no spoiler). Also, once he gets rescued they clean him up too quick, one minute he is on death's door, the next minute he is the aqua velva man. I would have liked to see him in his just rescued Robinson Crusoe look trying to relate to humans again and contrast his wild man look interacting back with civilization.

4 February 2001,Outstanding!!,"I've been to see quite a few films recently and none of them grabbed my attention as much as this. I wouldn't say that I'm a die hard Tom Hanks fan but I do like movies he's in, so I knew that I would enjoy it despite some reviews saying that it's a boring 2 1/2 hour FedEx commercial. He works for FedEx for crying out loud, of course you're going to see the name appear every now and then, and it's far from boring.

You get so absorbed in the film that you really feel for Hanks' character who is acted out superbly. I've never had a feeling of so much dread as I did when the plane flight started to go wrong, the surround sound was spot on. After you've got you're breath back from that scene and he finally realises that he's all alone on that tiny island, you start to feel everything for Chuck (Hanks), desperation, sorrow, his boredom (not yours). It's humourous in certain places where the film touches on the black comedy genre (washed up corpse scene). And finally when he gets back and everything has changed after 5 years, he realises everything that he used to take for granted, lights, food, bed and the only thing he didn't take for granted he can't have anymore...his girl.

This film is a must see!! Don't be put off by the length of it, you don't even realise, honest....Outstanding!!",
22 December 2000,"Wham, Bam, Snooooooooooore","Interesting, but hardly an intellectual stretch. I do agree with other reviews that it is visually appealing cinematography, however, that alone does little to save this snore. If you thought that Blair Witch Project was great, then you might think the same of this film. If, however, you thought BWP was trite and, then save your money and more importantly, your time. To sum up: it was only the second movie during which I have found myself dozing off. Sorry, Tom... you can do much better.

2 January 2001,Life is too short to live by the clock.,"Cast Away was a great movie - the emotion of the story of Tom Hanks (Chuck) rushing through every day life as a FedEx corporate Trainer and stating lines like ""You live by the Clock"" is so true. We all live by the clock in our fast busy every day lives of juggling careers, friends, and relationships. But life slowed Tom Hanks down in Cast Away - it snatched that clock right away from him and landed him on a deserted island to think about what is the importance in life. For him it was Kelly (Helen Hunt), his true love.

Tom Hanks was superb and his terror and fear ran through me in this movie. The cinema-photography was so vivid! The airplane crash was so real, the close up of Tom knocking his tooth out and the huge waves that crashed down on him was so real, vivid and placed me right there with him.

I rated the movie 8 Stars - I wanted to give it 10 stars, but the ending left me wanting more. The beginning and the middle of the movie were excellent and the ending was sweet - but so much more could have closed it.

You won't regret seeing Cast Away - I didn't!",8
23 January 2001,"Pretty film, weak script","Hanks' solo role on the island is a great piece of acting and film-making, despite some annoying minor technical glitches - sound out of sync, poor colour timing etc. The plane crash scene that leads to his arrival on the island is surprisingly gripping as well. However, the script of this film seems quite weak in places and the post-rescue scenes are bordering on unbelievable; The 'happy' ending appears as it was tacked on, almost as an afterthought. And just what was the deal with the whales ? Wait until it comes out on video, or leave after the plane crash...

1 December 2001,Survival on a tropical island teaches survival everywhere.,"Fate or chance events removes a Chuck (played by Tom Hanks), a FedEx employee driven and consumed by the constant advance time, from all he knows. He is left on a deserted tropical island with almost nothing. How can he survive? Why should he?

In the most powerful fade-to-black ever, we are utterly alone with merciless rainy night as our raft heaves in the South Pacific. Thus does Chuck begin his journey of self.

Chuck's value for time fades, letting years drift away as he becomes a primitive. Chuck clings to his humanity with his remembered love relationship (played by Helen Hunt) and developing a new friendship with Wilson the volleyball (played by Wilson the volleyball). Chuck's friendship with Wilson shows the strength of social bonds and his desperate need to have a relationship. That social side of humanity is every bit as important to survival as finding water or food. Seemingly chance events ignite Chuck's rebirth as a master of the time than once ruled him. Time becomes just another tool he uses to go on surviving.

Don't think of this movie as an island survival movie whose epilogue begins with his rescue. You will think the ""ending"" is too long, and you will miss the point. The island portion with its random cruelties of nature is a model of the survival that Chuck (and all of us) must face. He returns to civilization and must choose to go on with the good and bad consequences of what has happened. In fact, this movie does not end, it continues within your own imagination.

This film makes marvelous use of the absence of music. On the island, he is without it. Elsewhere, the most powerful moments are created with silence, or with sounds of nature, which may only be set up, or framed by music.

The film has wonderful sense of irony in its use of time and its references to time: the train conductors pocket watch (symbol of the first industrialized need for time accuracy) with the photo of his beloved is Chuck's tie back to his previous life. Chuck creates an analemma calendar. Chuck quotes himself on the importance of time.

Chuck's journey of self teaches him to accept what he cannot control, to shape what he can, and, like a true survivor, to heed small hints sent his way. His profound apologies to his FedEx friend and to Hunt's character show his mastery over fate does not excuse him from his humanity. He discovers on the island and back in Texas the role of hope in survival. The opening and ending of the movie have many details which reward viewing multiple times.

A Christian perspective: Chuck's character would not work so well were he in a living relationship with Christ. It is impossible for a Christian to have the same sense of loneliness.",9
8 March 2001,In a word - Brilliant!!!!,"This movie is so good. Before going to see it I knew Tom Hanks was a good actor but he is so much more. How one man can star in this and still keep you rivited is amazing. He deserves his third gong for this! The plane crash is incredible and ensures that this will never be shown as an inflight movie!

19 January 2002,Excellent,"This film is as ambiguous as life itself and, for that reason, it does not provide a fascile, crowd-pleasing Hollywood ending. Are there flaws? Yes, and I have a few quibbles myself. But imperfections aside, Cast Away is a highly unappreciated film which I enjoyed more than anything else I've seen in several years. As for complaints about the ""4 years later"" break, what were the film-makers to do? Roll cameras daily, for close to a year, while Hanks shed over fifty pounds? Certain restrictions apply! All in all, Cast Away (a pun, by the way--the character is a castaway who has been Cast Away from his societal identity) is a moving and compelling piece of work which gets better with each successive viewing. Kudos to Tom Hanks, who gives an extraordinary performance, and to all involved.

12 April 2001,Acting Tour De Force,"In Cast Away, Tom Hanks delivers a powerful performance which virtually defines the film, a tale of a man literally stripped bare of his societal pretensions. Hanks is a premiere performer and his work in this film definitely deserved an academy award. Of course, the ""oscars"" have rarely reflected the ""best"" that there is to offer in films. Fortunately, Tom Hanks is an artist who surely realizes his best reward is in the work he does. Comments that the movie is ""boring"" depress me. Would viewers have preferred to see Daryll Hannah wash up on the island?

8 August 2001,An almost perfect film,"This is one of the biggest hits of the year, so I'm not going to waste time with a description of the plot.

Let's begin.

Basically, the first twenty minutes are boring, then Tom Hanks gets on the plane, and the moment the plane begins to experience trouble, this film is a technical masterpiece right up until he leaves the island. Yes, sorry, he does get off the island, but this shouldn't come as a surprise since the trailer ruined that shock before the film even opened.

Tom Hanks is washed ashore and the next hour and a half results in one of the most amazing pieces of film making ever. Tom Hanks is brilliant in what could have been a one dimensional role; Robert Zemeckis directions with another firm hand; and, above all, I got really attached to that damn volleyball, so kudos to the film makers on that, too.

But, then he gets off the island, and it's another twenty/thirty minutes until the film finally resolves itself - Hanks has to get back to the girl he left waiting for him, even though it's been four years, played by Helen Hunt. Now, I like Helen Hunt, she's a fine actress, but she's terribly overrated. If someone could tell me why she won an Oscar for As Good As It Gets, I would like to know because every character she ever plays, regardless of the film, is the Jamie Buchman character from Mad About You. She's wasted here, with hardly more than a cameo, and the film suffers as a result.

The trailer ruined what could have been a perfect film, since there's no surprise that he gets off. But the film almost collapses on it's own with a weak opening act, and a terrible third. This film would have been far better off if the hanks character had been on the plane in the very begginning, and the movie ending with him getting off. Hell, even though 3/4 of the movie was spent on the island, the film makers could have shot an extra half hour of stuff, slapped it in, rather than the weak first and third act, because everything on the island is perfect.

The rest is weak, contrived, Hollywood tripe.

All in all, a good movie, that is great if you fastforward the first twnety minutes and shut it off after he gets off the island. Hanks deserved an Oscar, hands down. And so did that damn volleyball.

I was impressed with how the film makers managed to surpress any shark attacks, since it has become a Hollywood cliche. I would love to give this film a 10/10, but due to the first and third acts, I can only give it an 8. Still, highly recommended, but I recommend having the remote in your hand.",
6 September 2023,One of the most memorable films of the 2000s,"""Cast Away"" is a film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks.

One of the most surprising aspects of ""Cast Away"" is the interpretation of Tom Hanks.

His performance is extraordinary, and his commitment to the role of an isolated man on a desert island conveys authenticity and emotion.

One of the things I liked most was the narration which focuses on Chuck's struggle for survival, but also explores his transformation as an individual. Isolation and loneliness force him to confront himself and re-evaluate the priorities of life.

Another element that deserves praise is the soundtrack of Alan Silvestri that helps create an engaging atmosphere.

20 July 2018,Made me belly laugh - later I heard that bellies shouldn't laugh at this movie,"I remember watching this in the cinema when I was just 20 years old. My friend and I found the part where Tom Hanks is talking to Wilson, the volleyball, pretty funny. We even held our bellies in belly laughter; it was hysterically funny to us for some reason that I've forgotten this 18 years later.

The next evening I was reading the newspaper at my night shift gas station attendant job when I saw an editorial in the Ottawa Sun about the movie. The writer was furious about two young men laughing during the movie The Castaway that he wrote a scathing article about the incident and the impudence of the youth and the lack of respect for serious movies.

I didn't feel particularly scolded; I just felt that this man needs to calm down or perhaps get a hemorrhoid removed.

In fact, the friend I brought with me to the cinema was having a hard time at University and the movie was a good way to cheer him up.

The Ottawa Sun columnist was so upset by the incident that he actually wrote a follow up a few days later. Maybe he didn't have a lot of things to write about.

I imagine that he was thinking this during the movie,

""Those impudent ingrates!!! My society makes entertaining serious movies to shape up these rebellious, slovenly, backwards youths and they scoff in my face?! Laughing during the movie? During my viewing time no less?! I am a columnist! You will pay two teenagers! I'll write one scathing article to fix you right the heck up! No, not one, two really scathing articles! Two articles later and you will be so sorry!",8
27 July 2003,am i crazy???,"love the movie....hanks is awesome. but one thing drives me insane, at the part when kelly gave chuck him car back, and he's driving away, and she runs down the driveway, it sounds like shes yelling, ""jack!! jack!!"" not ""chuck!!"" before i ever saw the movie, that sceen was on the movie trailor, and when i was watching the movie for the 1st time, i kept thinking, ""well, if his name is chuck, who the hell is jack??"" who agrees w/ me on this?? speak up, i know ur out there.

19 November 2021,A planeload of undelivered packages,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",7
11 October 2015,"Realistic film, but not ""Lost'","Believe it or not,until last night,I had never seen this movie. I'd seen snippett's of it on The Oscars and other places but I just hadn't seen it. I made one attempt about 2 years ago,checking the movie out of library but the copy had been grossly damaged. Finally though,my brother stopped by with his copy and we watched it. He's seen it several times.

My overall impression after watching it was,""Wow,what an amazing story"". The story of a man who has little time for his very understanding wife who obviously loves him like crazy. Who takes off just before Christmas of 1995 on doomed flight that will alter his life forever.

The scene of the mayhem that ensues in side of the plane was very well done,as were the scenes of Hanks' character surviving the angry seas. Finally he arrives safely to a deserted island. Where for the next 1500 days his will to live is put to the test.

He finds food,makes shelter,works like a caveman to create fire and basically just learns the art of true survival. All the while the only other thing keeping him going is the antique pocket-watch given to him by his wife before he boarded the plane. Her picture in the watch gives him hope that he'll return to her someday soon.

After 4 years pass,he's still surviving but his mind has drifted into a state of altered reality. He's taken to painting a face on a soccer ball (with his own blood) and nameing it ""Wilson"",as it says on the ball. ""Wilson"" becomes his best friend.

Finally (and quite amazingly) near the end of this,another piece of the plane washes up on shore and he uses it as a sail for a raft he builds. It's actually a credit to Hanks' acting when ""Wilson"" falls overboard into the ocean and floats away,Hanks actually makes us feel his loss for this imaginary friend.

Upon being rescued and getting home,he discovers his wife and friends gave up on his return. Se's remarried with children and his friend informs him that they had a funeral and wake for him.

His now ex-wife realizes she shouldn't have listened to her friends & family who said she should just ""let him go"". Which gives us a slightly ""hollywood"" scene of her calling to him & chasing after him in the rain as he's driving off. They still love each-other but the damage is done.

With the life he knew gone he's now at a complete loss as to what he's supposed to do with it now. The ending really doesn't provide a clear-cut answer but merely hints at it. I can only guess the question to ask by the ending is,""What would I do if all this happened to me""? I give ten stars because the movie is simply that engaging,moving even a bit suspenseful (if you've never seen it. The scenery is breathtaking as well and the whole movie is worth the time to watch. (END)",7
15 September 2019,Still SO good,"I saw this movie when it first came out and appreciated it, but it was only when it started to re-run on TV that I would watch it again and again. Bought the DVD. This movie is incredible. I still watch it when it comes on.

31 December 2000,I thought I was stranded in a deserted movie theater and waited for four years to be rescued by the credits. (Warning: One spoiler in the 3rd paragraph),"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away.

25 December 2000,hank's best role...,"...since 'Bachelor Party.' no, actually I'm in agreement with pretty much everyone else. this was an enjoyable movie. not only was I glad that a movie was made around this subject, but also for the fact that audiences are into it. there are a few intense scenes, especially the airplane crashing into the ocean and Chuck trying to retrieve Wilson while pulling his raft in the middle of the ocean. along with ""the Perfect Storm"", I appreciate the moments in which the main characters' attempt the seemingly fool-hardy task of defeating the ocean. in ""cast away"" Chuck ultimately succeeds, while Clooney & crew failed. the lack of a musical score on the island and only focusing on wild sounds was a clever trick by Zemeckis. I was a bit disappointed that huge gaps in Chcuk's stay on the island occurred, but this wasn't Robinson Crusoe. both Hanks & Hunt are sickenly appealing, but Hanks has the ability to make the viewer identify with his character. I constantly found myself asking how I would be able to survive in this situation, and I very much doubt I'd survive as long as Chuck did. anyways, this movie is a much better collaboration between Zemeckis & hanks than ""forrest gump"" which stunk to high heaven.

3 January 2001,Does anyone know what Chuck went through?,"WE saw the harrowing loneliness in which a volleyball becomes a muse and best friend. But NO ONE in the film except perhaps the freighter crew that picked him up see him as anything but a little buffer upon his return. The Helen Hunt reunion in the driveway was sad but not as poignant as it might have been. Can some cracked crab from the FedEx HR department really make up for four years of nothingness?

18 January 2001,Some good moments but ultimately goes nowhere,"After the good reception in the US, I looked forward to seeing this film when it opened here in Australia. In the end, I was disappointed.

The first part of the film builds the character of Chuck (Tom Hanks), and shows us his relationship with his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt). I thought that a lot of the dialogue in this section (especially in the plane before the crash) was poorly timed and delivered, and didn't really contribute much to the story.

The crash scene itself is excellent, and the middle section of the movie (on the island) is enjoyable. The use of an 'imaginary friend' to allow dialogue on the island (and to show the character trying to cope with the loneliness and avoid madness) was novel and effective.

However I felt it went downhill when he returned to civilisation. There were many unanswered questions (why try and tow the raft when he had oars? If the package was so important to his will to live, why leave it unexplored until the end?) and an unsatisfactory examination of the effect of Chucks return on the relationship between him, Kelly, and her new husband.

In all I felt it was a fairly average movie, with some missed opportunities and fairly good performance from Tom Hanks. I'd recommend waiting for it on video.",6
12 January 2001,"More Like ""Throw Away""","I was so excited to see this movie! Generally speaking I am not the biggest fan of Tom Hanks, but was curious to see whether he could be redeemed in my eyes. Enough said, I think he did a fabulous job of a boring movie. Yes, boring. The best part was the end, but unfortunately didn't turn out the way we had hoped. After listening to the audience ""ooh, ahh and cringe"" I felt completely disappointed as the credits rolled. The scenes were very predictable and lacking in originality. Sorry....and thank god it was free.

6 January 2004,Thinly veiled commercial for Federal Express?,"I saw this movie for the first time last night on network TV. For a ""guy-alone-on-desert-island (or planet)"" movie, it's no better than fair. I agree with those who give 1964's ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" a better score. But the thing that makes this flick so flaky and unbelievable is that it appears to be a dual production, i.e. a movie AND a commercial for the package delivery company continually being shoved into our faces during the film. Very bizarre. I long for the old days when movies were actually entertaining!

10 January 2001,I just can say: wow!,"Robert Zemeckis did it again! He never stops to impress me! Man, this guy is talented! What a great director.

And what a great film! I loved this movie. I laughed, I cried, and I enjoyed the film.

Certainly one of my favorite movies of the year. My second favorite, because Erin Brockovich is still my fave.

But man, this film was great. Very intelligent, with great acting, funny stuff, and lots of drama.

I loved Wilson! The interaction between Tom Hanks and Wilson was perfect. I cried when he got lost. I cried a lot! And I still can't believe it. I cried for a volleyball!!!

The ending of the film wasn't bad! It was great!!! The wings, all the symbolism. Everything! I rate this film with 10 stars.

Oh, and the music! Even though most of the film passed out with no music, the moments with music were great! I don't know yet who was the composer for this film, but he did his best! And excellent job.

What else? I don't know what else to say... Oh, I kept crying even when the film was already finished. I was walking with my mom to the car, and I was crying.

One more thing, the scene of the airplane crash was great! Wicked, horrible, terrific! Arrrggghhh, I loved this film!

One of the years best. I hope it gets nominated for the Oscars. I guess we'll have to wait and see.",9
14 February 2001,"Not Hank's Best, But Still A Good Movie","This is a good movie to watch at home on the big screen TV with a DVD. (That way, you can pause it when you have to go to the bathroom.) The script was good, the plot almost totally believable and Tom Hanks did his usual great job of pulling it off. The only complaint I had was that the movie was too long and dragged the volleyball bit out a little far when he risked his life to try and save ""Wilson"". I think it would have been a little better if they cut down the island time and concentrated a little more about how the character tried to rebuild his life after coming back home. Other than that, I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely buy the DVD when released.

24 December 2000,Couldn't wait for it to get over...,"I'm afraid that this movie was a big disappointment for me. Maybe because I had such high hopes. The most entertaining part of this movie was the first 45 minutes or so leading up to and including the plane wreck. The island scenes were necessary to the plot but unnecessarily drawn WAY WAY out. And then finally, the ending was anti-climactic and almost predictable. At the theatre I watched this movie, the film broke half way through, which was a welcome pause to the almost pointless island survival scenes. The relationship between the characters played by Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt could have been more deeply explored so that by the end of the movie, I could have cared whether they got back together or not. I rated this movie a 5, and that's being generous...

25 December 2000,Some points about the ending,"Although the last meeting between Chuck and Kelly was a bit manipulated and manipulative, their confrontation was essential for the underlying theme of the story: the film's title is ""Cast Away"", not castaway. And this part of the plot does have psychological truth for anyone who has suffered a traumatic, life-altering loss or change: despite how overused the term is, there is a strong hunger for ""closure."" This is a very satisfying film , for its acting, direction and camera work, and for its ability to largely escape the usual, degrading interference of Hollywood.

4 May 2004,the nature oriented film,"i do like this film very much, because it does concentrate mainly on the expected and natural acts that people do in the emergent situations they are put in. For example, Tom Hanks in the film didn't have any tool to burn fire; so, he insisted on using two pieces of wood and touching them strongly together in order to make fire, which at the end had happened after a very big effort of him. This shows us how simple we might find things, which in real had gone a long way of improvement before reaching their last figure and appeal. At the same time i do also like this film very much, because it takes into consideration the human feelings and relations, like when Tom Hanks lost William, you can notice how bad and lonely he felt, as if William was a real personal. What i like also in this film is how Tom Hanks has insisted on getting out of his problem, which is staying on the island, by preparing for making a boat and taking into consideration all the troubles he might face and putting a timing for all what he is doing... All of this shows how human creativity and intelligence can be used in any situation, either a known one before or un unexpected and unknown one.

27 December 2000,"Long & slow, but most important, thought provoking.","The movie seems longer than it actually is because there's not a lot of action. Other than the crash scene, the movie was slow and even tempoed.

After the movie, while everyone else was complaining about what a yawner the film was, I was thinking about the events that had taken place. The most important quote of the film (I think) what when Chuck Noland told Wilson, ""Don't commit the sin of turning your back on time.""

Although long, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who's at a turning point in their life, or someone who questions their place in this world. This movie generated some good questions in my mind.

22 December 2000,I now know how boring it is to be stranded!,"This movie was OKAY...it could have been better. This movie is at least 2 1/2 hrs long, and I experienced many of the same things that Tom Hank's character experienced such as extreme boredom and frustration. This movie did not pull at my heart strings... I was just so happy when the credits FINALLY rolled. I thought the relationship between the 2 main characters was weak and unfulling at the end. Overall, the point of this movie was corny and short lived.

10 September 2004,The real message of the movie is NOT about being stranded on an island,"If you haven't seen the movie, don't read this discussion, because my discussion might give a hint to the ending of the movie.

The real message is you shouln't treat your professional life more importantly than you personal life.

When Tom Hanks was having a joyous dinner with his girlfriend, family, and close friends, he was interrupted by a telephone call from his company. He was told he had to leave and travel half way around the world to fix a problem for his company.

Next thing he knows, Tom Hanks was stranded by himself on a island. He couldn't leave the island for years.

When Tom Hanks finally got back to the real world, the love of his life (Helen Hunt) has already married to another man. (Ironically Helen Hunts was married to a dentist, and Tom Hanks had to remove a bad tooth when he was on that island)

I was so touched by the scene when Tom Hanks went to Helen Hunt's house for the first time, after Hanks came back from the island.

They had soooo much love between them. But so much has changed since the last time they saw each other, when they were having that dinner when that phone call came, and when they exchanged Christmas presents in that car, just before they said good bye. Helen Hunts has already married to another man and they already have a baby.

They still love each other so much. And they know they were meant to be husband and wife. But they know that they couldn't turn back the clock.

Remember the scene when they remove the baby seat from the car?

The message of the movie is your love ones are more important and precious than your job and career.

I was so emotionally touched by the last 15 minutes of the movie, I almost cried.",
27 December 2000,"Sadly, not all can appreciate this movie...","I saw Cast Away for the 2nd time tonight and I was amazed at what I had missed the first time. Everything made me love it even more than I did before. Unfortunately, not everyone in the theater shared my sentiment. Several left with only 15 minutes to go and one idiot even yelled how much the movie ""sucked."" To ignorant people like these, I suppose Wilson was just a volleyball, not an object to represent Chuck's rational side and will-power survive on the island. His drifting away signaled that Chuck no longer needed him; he had fought on and now he was to be rescued. Many griped that Chuck should have opened the winged package. Why? Here was his FedEx instincts at work and his commitment to never turn his back on time. Who cares what was inside?! Anyway, I could go on forever about all the symbolism in this movie, but I'll give that a rest.

Everything in Cast Away was superb: the acting, the script, the awesome cinematography, and of course, Bob Zemeckis's wonderful direction. Tom Hanks should at least be nominated for Best Actor, but I doubt he'll get it. In any case, his brilliant work really carried the movie when there wasn't much verbal communication.

Well, if you're reading this and have seen the movie, I hope you can relate to what I am saying. If you haven't seen it, then definitely go, but only if you can appreciate this movie for its depth and presentation of the relentlessness of the human spirit. Otherwise, you are likely to be disappointed.",9
25 October 2001,Superb,"Hats off to you Tom, in a film where for long periods its a one man show, you really put the audience on that desert island and made them think what it really would be like to be stranded ! Even if you don't like Tom Hanks, just watch the first 30 minutes with the colume up fairly high; I promise you'll experience one of the most jaw dropping moments in cinema. When will Hanks ever make a bad film (since Bonfire of the Vanities of course !)

3 January 2001,Cast Away 1/3 of this film!,"Don't get me wrong. I love Tom Hanks. I love Robert Zemekis. The production values are outstanding - however, you could take the ice skate axe ""Chuck Noland"" put together to the celluloid on this film, for my money.

The overlong island sequences had me counting the ceiling tiles in the theater. There was little character development here, just a means to show how clever Noland was in using the elements from the Fed-Ex packages.

Helen Hunt's natural acting style, even though her performance was brief, made this film worth watching.

4 December 2002,Dont waste the time.,"This movie is a joke.

Tom Hanks is a tremendous actor but, sadly this movie falls short even with his help. Although it proves my theory that if someone filmed him utilizing the facilities of a McDonalds someone would nominate the movie for an award.

If you havent the wits to stand up when drowing in a foot of water the things he does in this movie might seem pretty entertaining. To the rest of us we all sat there wondering when he was going to get around to trying the things he did, and why he didnt try others.

Most importantly we are just wondering who is doing what with and laughing while doing it with the money we wasted on this pathetic joke of a film.

1 January 2004,Not as bad as many say! Come back to your basics people!,"Too many hypercritical U.S. Americans here I guess! Not that I'm not a critical movie watcher but I wouldn't say that this movie was bad at all! The end was a bit of a let down but the rest of the movie was ok! Almost like a message to fingerpoint how good people have it in their civilizations! I would even claim some people sometimes deserve to experience what happened to Chuck Noland. Even including me sometimes. I tend to imagine myself into the role of the characters often. That makes me thankful for what I got! This movie shows how hard survival would be without any equipment but just some improvised stuff. The scene where he lost his 'friend' Watson was making me sob though it actually was only a volleyball, but this movie shows very well that and how such things can become important and closed into the heart.

11 October 2004,One of my favorite movies,"When I first viewed ""Cast Away,"" I was not entirely impressed. However, watching it just a second time allowed me to appreciate it much more. Tom Hanks did an impressive and unbelievable job being the sole focus of the movie for nearly 2 hours as a marooned FedEx worker on an uninhabited island. Aside from this, I have been able to connect with the underlying theme of the movie with Hanks' character having to struggle with, not only survival, but solidarity as he fought to get off the island to return to a woman already gone. Everything from the soundtrack to the authenticity the makers of this movie were able to achieve were just perfect.

Highly recommended from me!

22 December 2000,"Hanks, Zemeckis deliver again","Once again, my favorite actor, Tom Hanks, delivered the goods. His stunning performance and transformation in this movie should garner him his third Oscar. The fact that I began to care for a volleyball named Wilson is a clear indicator of Hanks ability as an actor. I gave this movie a ten because of Hanks performance, how they shot the plane crash, a beautiful score, and Robert Zemeckis' ability to make a two and a half hour film fly by. It is up there with Forrest Gump as one of my favorites.

1 January 2001,What's the point of cliff-notes trailers???,"Why, oh why did they give the whole movie away in the trailers and TV commercials? What could possibly have been the point? To get us to see it? I didn't need that. I was going to see it after viewing the first trailer months ago...you know the one where he lands on the island and yells ""Hello,...anybody!!"" and then it fades to black. That's all I needed. I was hooked right there. Yeah, Tom Hanks was great. Yeah, it was a good story, so what.

My whole experience of this movie was a big let down, because I knew what was going to happen. I'm sure others who say they didn't really enjoy the movie are feeling the disappointment stemming from this knowledge, as well. The only thing I didn't know for sure was what was going to happen after he got back to civilization...but I had a pretty good idea, and I was right, which was another disappointment. Predictability kills a movie for me. I don't want to know what's going to happen before I see it, and I certainly don't want the whole movie laid out for me in the trailer, as this one was...ridiculous.

I still can't believe it. If you've seen all the trailers for this movie, as I did, there was really no reason to see the movie in the theatre...because you've already seen it, in condensed form. Of course, by just seeing the trailers you don't get the full range and impact of emotion and the subtle nuances that drive the plot forward, and of course you miss the cinematography that makes the movie great to look at, as well as the remarkable physical transformation of Tom Hanks' character, but if you want to know what this movie is all about, and I do mean ""all about"", then the trailers are all you need.

I kept waiting for something to happen...some twist in the plot. Maybe he would come back and be unable to re-acclimate himself to civilization, or something...anything. But from the moment he came back, the movie sank into dismal predictability, heart-wrenching, yes, but predictable, just the same.

This seems to be a nasty trend in trailers, lately. Perhaps the rationale is the more they show in the trailer, the more will come to see the movie. Faulty logic, if you ask me. Once you have the fish on the hook, you don't keep throwing bait at it.",

16 January 2001,Amazingly dull..... a complete waste of time,"The volleyball had a better role.....

Why does hollywood have to constantly dole out symbolic garbage? EVERY scene is this movie is a cheap attempt at profoundness..... Thanks for nothing......

People were crying in the sold out movie theater when I watched this film, yes it was that bad, I have laughed at serious movies before but I think Zemeckis was really looking for a comedy in this because I laughed the entire way through it.....

The cave men were able to make fire faster...... rubbing a couple of sticks together when you had the flashlight lense, and this guy is supposed to be some upper up smart guy in FEDex?

It takes him 4 years to decide to leave the island?

A port-a-potty ? give me break.... he had the rescue raft there on the island with him, yes it had holes in the inflatable part but the bottom was intact and would have made a better sail......

What happened to the toothache?

What happened to the ring box he gave to Helen ""I have 10 seconds of screen time"" Hunt?

For being in such a sad sorry shape for four years he sure recovered quick and looked as good as new after his ""rescue""

A very overrated movie. Zemeckis should get the booby award for worst film.....

I saw Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan and was very impressed with Hanks in both, but this movie washed that impression right out. Falls right into line with the great Costner bombs: waterworld, postman, for love of the game, 13 days, etc....

My advice: If you have to see this film, let a friend rent it and then only when it's on the $00.99 shelf.......",

13 January 2001,Excellent acting by Hanks (as usual) and a moving story....,"It takes a heck of a strong screenplay and a great actor to hold a viewers interest in watching how a man struggles to maintain his sanity while being cast away alone on a small island for years. I was moved by the story, and Hanks plays the part beautifully, perhaps as well as or better than any other of his acting peers. My only disappointment came with the very end.

23 December 2000,Beautiful FedEx corporate movie,"When I left the movie theater, last night, I felt embarrassed. Was there a message in that movie? OK It was just above perfect technically, the island scenes were beautiful, Tom Hanks was excellent, but what really disturbed me is the big advertising aspect of all this about FedEx. FedEx all the way, simply the best courier services in the world, always on time. I am afraid of seeing always more in the future for this kind of use of a blockbuster movie to try to sell us more and more products, from volleyballs (Wilson) to cars and computers and cellular phones.

Hey, they released this movie in Christmas time, to show us what a good way is FedEx to ship your gifts all around the world...

30 December 2000,Very Disappointing,"Although another very good Hanks performance, Cast Away leaves the viewer with a disappointing lack of closure. All of my family thought that the movie was well made, but not overly entertaining. Of course, about halfway through the movie, I'm thinking...""It's a movie about a deserted island, how exciting can it be?"" It wasn't. I guess that I was spoiled by Gilligan's Island as a kid, but I remember these kinds of places as a lot more fun.

When Hanks finally does get home, the storyline is unremarkable at best. We see very little of Hunt and Hanks seems to have nothing to teach us from his time in isolation.

Overall, we were just expecting a lot more from Hanks/Zimeckics

30 December 2000,"Good Movie, not great, but very good","A fine, highly quality film. If you have not seen it, please do so.

It never quite achieves classic status, however. The best parts are of course the island scenes.

Unlike many other comments, I actually thought the end part of the movie was good. It basically makes the viewer think about his or her own life, as Chuck Noland does, at his cross roads, both literally and figuratively.

Once he returns, his path of life is again uncharted and open to anything. That is, except for any future with his love Helen Hunt.

Tom Hanks is simply the best all around actor. We are enjoying this man in the prime of his life. If nothing else, see the movie to see Hanks.

1 January 2001,Another gem from Hanks!,"I came out of the theater wondering how Mr. Hanks could have condensed so much emotion and depth into what potentially seemed an empty movie. I think it's his best work since Dragnet. People compare his everyman style to the great Jimmy Stewart, and rightly so. Whenever I saw Hanks working his magic, for example in the charming scenes with the volleyball, you could see the mantle of 'America's Actor' being passed from Stewart to Hanks. I have'nt seen that kind of chemistry between an actor and non-speaking prop since Hanks' previous triumph, Turner and Hooch.

The direction captured the isolation of Hanks and his surroundings, whilst keeping an understated feel. Definitely Zemeckis' best job since Death Becomes Her and Forrest Gump. My one gripe being that the most memorable part of the movie was the crash sequence. I had hoped that the director could have matured, and not rely on special effect action sequences to carry his movies. And the dialogue was adequate too. I could'nt decide between this and Boyles Jnr's other standout, Entrapment.

There was support from Hunt and Noth: I thought that their acting on the periphery, provided the necessary distance that enhanced Hanks' realistic portrayal of solitude. The same effect that Tawney Kitaen and Adrian Zmed had on Hanks in Bachelor Party. The 'far-off' co-acting in both films provided the chance for Hanks to shine in his solo star role amongst the driftwood.

The ending, when we find Hanks back in civilization, I felt did'nt keep with the tone and pace of the film. Although we are now used to the heart-warming rousing finales of Hanks' movies, who could forget the close-out of Splash, I would have preferred to have seen Hanks see out the film still on the island, with the volleyball.

In closing I would rate Cast Away quite well against the other 'stranded on an island' movies I have seen. Hanks' project deals with the issues of alienation and survival, whilst not losing sight of the potential of fate that can rescue people from isolation and put them back into a more favorable position. Similar to what $1 million did for Richard Hatch after the Survivor TV series. And not to point all the credit to Hanks, seen in the box-office returns for Cast Away, I do hope that his co-star in Big, Jared Rushton received a few points after showing Hanks the potential for a 'lost in the wilderness' vehicle, after he starred in a not too dissimilar picture, A Cry In The Wilderness.

A 'twerp cinema' rating of four.",
18 January 2015,I like this Movie A lot. It attract the concept of the Social Importance.,"I have Used Several Online Movies Site to see the best quality of sounds and it effects in my theater. I am very much excited to listen its Music and Sound.

It is Great Lesson of the Socialization in this movie.

I would prefer to see this again and again and take moral from it. I am very much inspire by the character of the Hero and its affection with the her wife. She also loved but in world, writer another great vision that people loves, cares and thinks of only what he/she sees or feels. While, A strong man can survive everywhere on this earth but he need support of the social behavior and hence, they are called ""Social Animal"".

10 March 2001,One word: Epic,"Despite some of the lack-luster reviews Cast Away has received, this by far one of the best films of 2000-2001, possible one of the top 100. Beyond that, the film was amazing from beginning to end. Tom Hanks alone on island with just his buddy WILSON (The volley ball) which in my opinion is the best supporting actor in recent years. CAST AWAY is an amazing film and deserves a higher ranking than what it has received.

12 August 2001,good but disjointed,"Basically, I liked the movie and think that Hanks did a fine job.

But whoever decided to jump cut from the first couple of months on the island to FOUR YEARS LATER did a terrible disservice to the audience. In doing so we skipped over what could have been a fascinating story of Chuck's growth and an opportunity for Hanks to really blow us out of the water.

Instead we get an okay film with a likeable character and an interesting (but not unpredictable) ending.

20 June 2001,All the hype made me expect more.,"All the hype made me expect more. However, I cannot blame the movie media for overhyping this one. Afterall, it is a sin not to pay attention to any Tom Hanks movie. Helen Hunt's almost cameo-role made me want to see more of her to the point I was annoyed. Oh, well, I'll just rent As Good As It Gets again. That is all there is to it, folks -- Tom Hanks... nothing more.

What if they had starred Rob Schneider in this film, and put wild animals in that island with him? But then, there would be no need for Wilson, right? Hmmm... Forgive me for having a wild imagination.

25 April 2002,Cast Away,"Tom Hanks has yet again starred in one of the year's best films. After a little film about the AIDS virus called ""Philadelphia"", Mr. Hanks has been on a terrific film streak. Well his new film, Cast Away is another terrific eye-opener, about a FedEX troubleshooter (Hanks) who gets stranded on an island for four years after his plane crashed into the middle of the South Pacific. Chuck's last words to his fiancée, Kelly were ""I'll be right back"". A perfect touch to the film, that tells you of things to come. Chuck now must survive on his own both physically and emotionally without human contact and everyday devices that we all take for granted. The first hour or so after the crash has pretty much no dialogue, until Noland finds a package wash ashore. The package contains a Wilson volleyball. Well after Chuck cuts his hand; in pain he picks up the ball and throws it. It turns out, the blood stain on the ball shaped into a perfect face. Alot has been said about how stupid and unrealistic that a man would actually talk with a volleyball with a face on it for four years. Well I'll tell you something; picture yourself on a deserted island. Got it? Now here's the catch... YOU'RE ALL ALONE! You got absolutely no contact with anybody, and all you got is a volleyball with a face on it. I don't know about you but I'd go insane without anybody or anything to talk with. Wilson was symbolic to the other part of himself. He needed to talk to somebody (or for that matter, something) about the things he's learned in life, ideas, feelings, fears, jokes, stories, and memories. It's normal human behavior. We need some sort of a social life! It's impossible not to express your feelings with something, so he vented with Wilson. Let's also remember that he had a relationship with Wilson for four years! That is a very long time. The Wilson idea is very realistic and a perfect touch to the film.

Well after four years on the island, Chuck goes through many changes: his appearance and more importantly he has become much wiser. Chuck also managed to completely conquer the four of the basic human needs: food, shelter, water, and clothing. The film is about the human spirit and how strong it can become in difficult situations.

Cast Away is probably one of Robert Zemeckis' (Forrest Gump, What Lies Beneath, Back to the Future trilogy) greatest achievements since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". Robert Zemeckis is one of the most innovative and outstanding young directors and is definitely the future for directors and everyone should keep their eye on him... along with M. Night Shyamalan and David Fincher.

This is definitely one of the best films of the year and will leave you breathless. For those who thought Gladiator was the best film of the year (this means you the Academy), what I ask is, why? Sure Gladiator was a great film, and I liked it alot, but Cast Away has a moral (as did Requiem for a Dream which I personally thought was the best film of the year) and will teach you to respect the things we take for granted like fire, clothing, a place to live, etc... So I believe that the Academy only gives the picture that was most popular the Oscar, and that is quite sad.

Go see the film and learn to respect the things we take for granted.

4 July 2015,Why Survive? For self and for the eternal motivator -- love!,"The central story, Tom Hanks' character surviving a plane crash, being the sole survivor, and spending four agonizing years surviving on an uninhabited island is well done. After watching the film 3 o4 4 times, some detail jumped out at me that I hadn't previously noticed, or just wasn't paying enough attention. There are two women overshadowing Hanks' spiritual/physical journey. There is Kelly, the love of his life who becomes a ""lost love"" with the passage of time. Then there is Bettina, first merely a symbol (the orange wings) on the one FedEx parcel that Hanks decides to hang on to in case he gets rescued. Before his ill-fated air trip, the sign on the Texas Ranch says ""Tony"" and ""Bettina"". Over the passage of time Tony and Bettina (who we do not see or know) have become uncoupled just as Hanks' character and Kelly are uncoupling because of separation. Hanks is sustained by the pocket watch mounted photo of Kelly and to a lesser extent, by the presence of the ""Bettina"" parcel. Near the end of the film, when he is back on the mainland, he has to come to terms with the loss of Kelly, while simultaneously if not knowingly opening himself to finding new love with Bettina. Love lost; love found. An interesting juxtaposition. This is, as stated, a more cameo part of the overall story but one which should not be lost sight of--for what can motivate a man to survive against all odds is the possibility of finding new love to replace the one lost?",9
22 July 2015,Great mass entertainment,"The classic Zemeckis-Hanks flick. The kind of movie I knew was good from the first scenes, with the long tracking shot of a FedEx package, when the camera is glued onto it and the focus shifts on Tom Hanks' character. I was sold. And I'm not talking about the plane crash scene which was just impressive. Look at the track records of Robert Zemeckis (before the perfcapt movies) and tell me he's not a good director. The narration here works so well because it's always focused on something, mainly Tom Hanks, and never wavering, and all the drama is channeled through him. When you think about it, there's only 1 character for 1h30 of the movie (unless you count Wilson as a character) and it's never boring.

Only the end felt a little flat, Tom Hanks is basically mute, and we don't really experience how what he's gone through has changed him.

In the end it's basically a very well made and thoroughly researched mass entertainment movie, which of course has these little annoying 'merican narrative things (Tom Hanks is SO good at his job, he loves his wife SO much), but it moved me, so kudos.",8

They are like really lovely illustrations torn out of some old book. They make one want to read the book. But, where is the Book? I knew it was all over when, during the kiss in the rain, I looked over at my wife (who cries at Pepsi commercials) and saw her sitting their as dried eyed as a statue. Now that was symbolic to me of just how deeply Zemekis had failed to draw us into the lives of these people. Did I know who these people were? Did I care? No and no. And Too bad, cause I went into the theatre wanting to care. I just really wasnt given any reason to.

2 January 2001,"Great Hanks performance, but...","You've read the synopses, you know what the movie is about. Let's get to the meat... skip if you wish no spoilers. Tom Hanks did a fantastic job of creating a believable character. His acting was perfect for the role. Up until his eventual rescue the film is excellent. Sure, we could have seen more of his ""decline"" into more primitive processes, and it would have added to the movie. The roundabout way his suicide attempt is introduced in the movie is effective. The crash is harrowing. His discoveries on the island are phenomenal. His ""transformation"" into the lean, thousand-yard stare, almost-hopeless primate is wonderful (he seems almost neanderthal in his reaction to the porta-potty piece in the water... loved it). The movie _after_ the rescue missed its mark. Hanks discussion with his friend on the private plane had neither the stilted quality one might expect from someone whose sole partner for 4 years was a punctured volleyball, nor did it have the possibly clamouring quality of someone who is finally around a lost friend. I could expect either, but instead we are treated to a rather bland characterisation. In fact, all of the interactions with others (save the rather emotional monologue to the same friend later) have this detached quality that TO ME seems inappropriate somehow. This is almost painfully true in his interaction with his long-lost sweetie, played by Helen Hunt. My problem is I can't seem to be able to imagine any _real_ people, when placed in the same situation, who would act the way that both of them act. Even the ""last chance"" part towards the end didn't have that emotion that one would expect in the situation. Anyway, I enjoyed the film, but am still mildly disappointed with the points above. I will still, however, probably buy it when it comes out on DVD. Go figure.",
12 January 2001,Excellent Ending!,"I had heard this was a pretty good movie with a weak ending. On the contrary, I thought it was a very good movie with an excellent ending! The ending was not typical of Hollywood movie endings, so I enjoyed it! If you are looking for the Boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl kind of plot so typical in todays movies, then you will not like the ending! If you can appreciate an ending you probably can't forsee - you'll like it!

8 February 2001,a man that lived by the clock takes a break,"The story line was great and the ads were terrific. I've enjoyed nearly every film made by Tom Hanks. He is an excellent actor, but I was displeased with this film. Hanks still did a fabulous acting job and if as one of the other commentors stated he would be nominated for an award, he still deserves it. This 2 1/2 hour movie could have been cut to 1 1/2 and still carry the same story line.

The reason that I scored this film low is that the second part of the film is so long and leaves you hanging and finally, bored. I actually yawned, wondering if there was anything else to the movie besides him being stranded on the island. There are scenes that show his progression, but what about his family, friends, FedEx and the Federal Government? It didn't even show the flight central (or whatever they call them) losing the plane from the radar and conducting the notifications.

They did a great job showing the transition from being Mr. Busy to Mr. Twiddle-My-Thumbs, but there was a lot left out that would naturally be happening that could have had the audiance reacting or wanting to react to the scenes after the crash. I think adding those other angles or viewpoints would have taken this film from being OK, to great.",4
24 January 2001,I couldn't wait for it to be over,"Like comments prior to mine, if you've seen the preview, you've seen the movie. It's not a thriller by any definition of the word. You go in knowing what's going to happen and you just sit and wait for it to occur on the screen. Save your money for something else.

25 December 2000,Tom Hanks Does It Again,"Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks have teamed up again to bring us a thoroughly entertaining new film in `Cast Away'. While `Cast Away' does not bring us the magic that `Forrest Gump' did, but in all honesty what really could, it does however show us the incredible range of actor Tom Hanks. It is hard to believe that this extraordinary actor got his start in such TV shows as `Bosom Buddies'.

Hanks in `Cast Away' spends much of the film alone so very little dialog is used, except in moments of frustration and brief `insanity' where he talks to his new best friend, Wilson, Hanks must rely on his actions to convey his emotions and he does this beautifully! In scene after scene he had me believing & feeling for what he was going through. Even in scenes that could have been ridiculous, i.e. risking his own well being for a volley ball, Hanks made me see the importance of saving this ball and pulled at the heart strings when he was unable to do so.

The movie itself falls short of a classic, with an unsatisfying ending and a wasted Helen Hunt as the girlfriend he left behind, but the real heart of this movie is Hanks and his fight to stay alive and that alone was worth every penny!",8
4 January 2001,Eating some peanut butter??,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",
1 April 2001,Awesome,"This movie has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. There wasn't that many lines, so he didn't have to memorize much speaking parts, but the facial expressions and the body movements are all part of it too and this movie would have been a flop without Tom Hanks. Definitely. The way he makes movies come alive and how deeply he is into them. It's amazing. I want to be an actress and I hope I'm half as good as Tom Hanks. He's my inspiration. Anything you'd like to say, email me Thanks!

24 December 2000,The things we take for granted...,"I for one thought this movie was excellent. I heard some cynical things about the movie before I went to see it, but when the movie was over I thought it was one of the best I'd ever seen. I thought that nothing could scare me in movies anymore but the scene of the plane going down was terrifying, and after the crash when he grabs the liferaft and surfaces, the lighting effects are fantastic. I give this movie a 10, and if you don't agree then obviously you are perfect and take nothing for granted.

27 December 2000,I didn't get it...,"OK, originally I thought that maybe I was just incredibly dumb, but as I read the other user reviews I see that I'm not the only one. I didn't get the ending. Just didn't make sense to me. Why didn't he open the package on the island? What's the deal with the wings on the package and the truck? Didn't get it... And also, I thought that they should have showed more of him on the island. I know that wasn't the primary focus of the film, but rather his battle with control and time and such, but that was the most entertaining part of the movie. I thought we were kind of cheated when we saw the text ""Four years later."" I would have enjoyed seeing how he survived for four years. Instead, we go from him being on the island for about 2 weeks to 4 years later, and I wondered, ""How did he survive that long? What did he do?"" It was too big a jump.

Overall, I was pretty much disappointed. 5/10.

16 January 2001,A one-man show...,"We all knew that Tom Hanks was the greatest actor of our generation before this movie was released. And again, Hanks delivers the goods. But were this a starring vehicle for any other actor, this movie would not be the box office smash it is. The heart of the movie, Hanks' fight for survival on a tiny Pacific island, is brilliant. What bookends the film, however, (much of which has been ruined by another ad campaign that shows TOO MUCH) pales not only in comparison to the rest of the film, but in comparison to just about any other film. Helen Hunt turns in a particularly uninspired performance with yet another sporadic attempt at an accent (this time vaguely Southern) that is as unnecessary as it is unconvincing. Were it not for Hanks' performance (which will certainly get him a deserved Oscar nod), this film would be easily set adrift by audiences.

4 January 2001,"In a world that is tired of long movies, this could have been the exception.","Watching this film left me and my friends thinking that maybe the butcher accidently cut off some of the meat while he was trimming the fat. Tom Hanks did great... but that is part of the problem. I ended up wanting to know more about his four years. Seems like the studio/filmmaker/whoever was a little too occupied with keeping the movie around 2 1/2 hours and not enough time giving us what we were hungering for. Redeeming qualities? Well, let's just say Castaway features one of the best disaster sequences I have ever seen. This movie would have worked much better as a 3 hour flick or a mini series... Strange for me to say, but that's how I feel.

26 December 2000,A real heartbreaker,"This movie had a lot going for it and I might have liked it a lot more if not for the trailer giving away too much of the plot. Hanks and Hunt are fantastic, their scenes together are touching and once they are reunited, their awkwardness toward each other is felt throughout the audience. It was incredible.

This film had fantastic scenery and cinematography, especially the plane crash. What I did not like was the ending. What I wanted to know was what was in the one package that he never opened. Wouldn't it have been nice for him to actually see that? Maybe talk with the artist instead of their meeting at the crossroads. For a second I thought I was watching the end of Thunderheart.

For a movie that opens on Christmas weekend, I was hoping for a something for a little more uplifting. This movie hurts you because the actors are that good. This is not something I'll add to my DVD collection because the emotional content was too heavy. Plus, some of the scenes were drawn out a bit with a lot spelled out for you. See it once, expect a sad ending, and you'll enjoy yourself.",6
28 December 2000,This was almost perfect.,"This movie was great. They executed the plane crash excellently. I laughed a lot in it, too. I'm not going to give anything away, but, I think the ending wasn't good at all. It wasnt enough for me. But, I would recommend going to see it.

22 December 2000,Oscar... meet Tom Hanks & Robert Zemeckis...,"Tom & Bob... meet ol' Osc...

This scenario would only happen if Tom, Oscar and Robert all had amnesia. Why? Because the threesome got acquainted back in 1995 when Hanks and Zemeckis worked together on Forrest Gump. And Believe me-you, the magic is still there. I just caught the film and let me tell ya... it's worth every penny or frank or pound or rubel or whatever; because where ever you might live, You will love this film. Being trapped on a desert isle is an old fashioned story I know, yet so is a love story, and so is a story of good vs. evil. And those stories show up all the time. Why? Because we like em. We'll see who's right come this March. Oh yes, we will see indeed.

14 January 2001,Deeper than you might think,"After reading others' reviews I ask myself ""Did they miss it?"" or maybe this movie is not for everybody. There are not many movies like this out there. I really appreciated not having any music to ""add"" to the intense scenes, it made the movie more real. There is also a very interesting and deep emotional side to the movie that made a definite impact on me... I don't mind the jumping around and not showing every detail... the important things were shown. He survived the physical and it was made to look easy compared to surviving the emotional. To love deeply and to let go... great tragedy, and real living. My words do not do justice to this great film, 9/10.

6 January 2001,This is an excellent film!,"In my opinion, this was actually a `film', rather than a `movie'. I liked it anyway. To me, a ""film"" is a movie where we are supposed to think about things. A ""movie"" is simply meant to entertain. In this film, we are taken into the world of Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee. We learn that he is his job. Time is his enemy. He loves his girlfriend Kelly, but to be together, they must compare planners. Then, his world changes drastically. He attempts to do things in his usual manner, very quickly. Time teaches him patience. We don't learn about Chuck through dialog as much as we do through the lens. There are scenes in the movie where we feel what the characters in the movie must be feeling, simply by seeing endless ocean and endless prairie. We also see the might of nature in stunning storm tossed seas and powerful winds. If you are patient, Chuck will tell you why he survived and then you will learn if he will survive. If I say anything more, it would spoil it for you. This movie is 2 and a half hours long, but it doesn't feel like a long movie. I honestly didn't notice the time passing. I do recommend this movie, whether you expect a movie to challenge your thinking or are someone that likes to be entertained. If you are like me, you are probably both.",10
5 January 2001,Interesting Movie,"This movie has many different points which can relate to normal people. The way Tom Hanks acted in it is remarkable. He depicted exactly how someone would respond to the environment alone. I too would have probably started talking to myself and making up friends. The one thing I don't understand about this movie is how it ended, Tom Hanks was just standing in the middle of the road staring off into nowhere. Other than that it was a decent movie, I think Tom Hanks deserves an Academy Award nomination for this role.

12 January 2001,No Oscars for this one,"I cannot understand why people are touting Hanks for an Oscar for this movie. Does not approach Forrest Gump or Philadelphia in any way shape form or fashion. Just a boring movie about a man on an island making conversation with a soccer ball. Tom was lost in this movie, only it was not on an island. Movie was too vague and left you hanging at the end. If you were not paying close attention at the start, you would not have even known that the name of the ranch had been changed by the time Hanks got there to deliver the package.

16 July 2001,Few dialogue make it unique,"Perhaps, the aspect of this film that mostly impressed me is constituted by the few dialogues and the great silence that make this film unique. It's well directed, well performed, and I think it has a good score too. It isn't certainly a masterpiece, but a good film. It tells about the story of a castaway, who manage to come back only four years later. His girlfriend is married and he has to re-start life.

Certainly Tom Hanks was more worthy of getting oscar than Russel Crowe.

24 March 2001,Great movie! Another amazing performance by Hanks.,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am glad that when hanks washes up on the deserted island they didn't load it up with all sorts of idiotic scenarios like pirates, or savage natives, or predators and such. It is just Hanks trying to survive the best he can all alone. He had plenty of time for soul searching to see what drives you to fight to stay alive. It makes you wonder how you would have done it if you were in his shoes.

The ending was different also from what you might expect. Its not all tidy happy ever after ending, which I liked. The reuniting of Hanks and Hunt at the end is very intense and touching that definitely tugs at you emotionally.

I thought Tom Hanks ego would do to this movie what Alan Alda did to MASH - RUIN IT! I was wrong, and I was swept up in the film. There is a love story to make the girls cry and enough cool stuff, especially the plane crash, to keep the guys from looking at their watches. Besides, I heard ""Hannibal"" was not that good.

27 December 2000,How many endings does one movie need?,"Zemeckis and Broyles deserve credit for a truly original version of a tired concept: Robinson Crusoe, Gilligan's Island, Survivor, etc. The middle (greater) part of the film, set on the island, is extremely watchable, never boring, and often moving. Tom Hanks is so acceptable to all of us as a sort of ""everyman,"" one can't help but fully identify with this character in these circumstances. (Also, I have to mention the plane crash is the most unsettling and, I assume, realistic I've ever seen.)

The one problem with the movie, and I think it actually fatally mars the whole thing, is the ridiculous ending(s) meant to spin some sort of sentimental closure. I counted 5 possible endings, and the thing kept going for 15 more minutes. I think the studio was probably afraid of ending on an uncertain note, so they just kept adding on until they reached the level of maudlin sentimentality they felt appropriate. In actuality, uncertainty would have perfectly matched the tone of Hanks' character at that point in the film.

23 December 2000,"""This is a great catch, not to be thrown back""","In the past years, Tom Hanks has been one of the greatest American actors ever. First ""Philadelphia"" then ""Forrest Gump"",""Toy Story"",""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""The Green Mile. Now, 11 months later, Tom Hanks is in top form, once again, in which could be his fourth Academy award nomination for best actor and hopefully a best picture nod. Those who are thinking ""Cast Away"", is just a one man ""Gilligan's Island"", are badly mistaken. No coconut phones, no wooden branch radios, this my friends is the real deal... Poor Tom Hanks, trying to survive on this island in the middle of nowhere, ""You owe yourself to see Cast Away""!!!

21 January 2001,"Not perfect, but wonderful","I saw 'Cast Away' last night and must say that I was very impressed. The fact that I am a fan of Tom Hanks probably helped me enjoy the film, because I doubt anyone who does not like Tom Hanks would enjoy 'Cast Away' being the fact that he is almost the entire film.

'Cast Away' is far from a perfect film, as there are some minor, and a few major, holes in the story and sadly the script is not always up to scratch. To be honest, I was a little surprised that the film has so many flaws, given the fact that the Australian media have been so full of praise. In my opinion however, Tom Hanks carries the film beyond these flaws and script letdowns, and while Helen Hunt is not given much to do, she is wonderful in the small screen time she has.

The first 25-30 minutes of the film is essentially fairly dull, however it has a certain edge to it created by the viewer already knowing what is install for Hank's character. The plane crash is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen on film. I was actually not looking forward to the plane crash footage because I figured it would be nothing more than something the audience would have to endure before the real story begun. However, it was so good that I actually felt myself tensing up, which really say's something about the footage because I rarely respond like that to anything on screen.

The cast away' part of the story is equally brilliant, because it could so easily have been unbearably boring. I think many reviewers on this website are correct in their disliking of the way in which it cuts to four years later', as it does feel as if Zemeckis took the easy way out in this respect. My only other complaint about the cast away' part of the story is Hank's escape off the island, which did seem a little rushed in execution and generally not as dramatic (with the exception of one moment, but I won't completely spoil it) as the events that had taken place before. However, this part of the film is by in large incredible, and a work of pure genius from both Zemeckis, but particularly Hanks.

Finally, many reviewers here have complained about the last part of the film, many suggesting that it went on too long. However, I did not find myself bored or restless during the last part of the film because I was generally interested in finding out what happens to Hank's character as he tries to re-enter society. My complaint about the last part has more to do with the script lulls, because the film does not answer some of the bigger questions regarding this transition. However, like all of the weaker spots in the film, Hanks carries the audience past them and it is his presence that makes this one of the best films since American Beauty (released around the same time last year)

I truly hope that Hanks gets his third Oscar for his role in this film, because quite simply, I have not seen a better performance in any film over the last 12 months.",
15 January 2001,Better than I thought,"Sometimes I think Tom Hanks gets nominated for too many awards so I was very skeptical of a long film about a Robinson Crusoe type film.

Sometimes it's nice to be surprised. The direction was unconventional by focussing on his island stay rather than flashing back all the time and Hanks gives what must be one of his best performances, making a very credible loner interacting with a volleyball!!

You come out with an invigoration of the human spirit determined to have a fulfilled life - whether we ever do is another issue.

17 January 2001,Think of people and things that you can't live without....,"I watched the movie one night while my sister was busy preparing her graduation admission exam in another room. After it was over, it really took me a while to regain myself, and then I came up to my sister and hugged her closely and tightly, ""Thank God. We're here with each other. And Xixi (her name), you know I love you.""

Probably nobody can truly present how a man would behave when being ""cast away"". But I think Tom Hanks did a good job in this movie - in both unimaginable and imaginable scenes.

What actually is this story about? the basic needs of mankind? the value of life itself? the courage to survive despair? hope and love the only salvation? the beauty of our everyday life that should not be neglected? how to define misfortune and fortune? ....

Points for us to ponder and many things for us to be grateful. And to say, to do, to love, to experience, to live our life to the fullest...",10
22 December 2000,disappointment/suprised/could have been so much better.,"There were so many scenes in this film that dropped the ball. Scenes that could have been dramatic. Instead, they went nowhere. For instance...as Hanks waded through the water, cutting his feet on coral. Blood was everywhere...yet no sharks? And, why not switch back to what was happening at home? People were leaving during the film - and NOT COMING BACK. This is no slam against Tom Hanks, for he is truly gifted. But the script clearly had problems. Several scenes could have brought gasps from the audience, brought suspense, drama to the film, instead, the man beside me started snoring. Too many set-ups without going anywhere. This was the very first time that I was disappointed with a Tom Hanks film. In the cave...a skeleton would have worked. Maybe during the crash, Hanks could have been saved by the captain, then when Hanks was safe in the raft, the captain could have been washed overboard and drown in the high seas. Of course, this is just my opinion, but I was just so disappointed in this film. I thought the ending could have been more dramatic and Hunt could have brought up the ring that Hanks had given her before he left. She could have gone back to Hanks, or maybe her husband could have loved Hunt so much that he actually sacrificed his own happiness so Hunt would be happy with the love of her life. Oh well, Sorry. Such talented people involved, yet I went away disappointed. I don't think I was the only one.",
25 December 2000,A fairly poor movie overall,"I was very disappointed after seeing this movie. The story not being original (see the book ""Robinson Crusoe"" by Daniel Defoe) I expected much more from the playwright than was offered. I could honestly say that I haven't learned anything from this film that I hadn't already known. Even the moments that were intended to be dramatic and thought-provoking were usually long and cliche; as for the adventure side of the movie, apart from a scene or two at the beginning, the adventure and the thrill are missing almost completely. Far from being a ""suspenseful thriller"", the movie leaves viewers wanting for more most of the time and eschews improvisation and the potential for action.

In short, if you've read ""Robinson Crusoe"" or even if you are a little familiar with the story then don't waste your time on this movie. It really isn't worth your time and Tom Hanks's acting cannot make up for the lame scenario.

25 December 2000,A classic case of interesting story turned commercial,"Riding on the coattails of Survivor, comes the movie Cast Away. I had the same complaints with Cast Away as I did with Survivor. Everyone wants to see a person sent to the naked edges of the Earth, and observe the actions, instinctive, animalistic, etc... There needs to be more motivation than just ""survival."" In Cast Away, Tom Hanks is stranded in the South Pacific (which doesn't happen until well into the 30 minute mark- a signature-Zemekis move of not getting to the point). The story, if we disregard all that has happened prior to this, is still interesting as hell- Man against Nature in its raw-est form. Still, Tom Hanks did a pretty good job. It's not as good of a movie as I had hoped for, but it's not without it's charm. 6 of 10

17 April 2001,Cast yourself away and SEE THIS MOVIE!!!,"I'm sure that the grapevine has reached all of you with good and bad about this movie. Instead of explaining the plot of this fantastic film ,(which are available and excellently articulated in prior reviews) I will explain how I never really left the theater that day.

I was looking forward to this film ever since it's trailer in The Grinch. While I was sitting in the theater I was hypnotically transported to the island with our hero. I was there, making hatchets out of ice skates. I was there, bawling my eyes out when Wilson passed on.

I commend both Hanks and Zemeckis for their ability to entrance the audience. I had begun to actually believe that the volleyball was really talking with Hanks' character. At first the idea was silly to me, but within minutes I could almost hear Wilson talking.

Mentally, I never left the theater. Sure, Chuck Noland was cast away, but so was the audience. When I physically left the theater I felt distant. I felt like one person instead of a member of society. I believe that's what Zemeckis and Hanks wanted you to feel. The entire film was about realizing yourself. It worked

I look at this film not as a drama but more as a fantasy that every human being should wish upon themselves. This movie was indeed a saga. It was like a trilogy in one movie. There will be no sequel. There will be no prequel. It's done. The movie opened and closed, stepping to the top of cinema history.",10
3 January 2001,An introspective look at the thematic implications of Cast Away.,"I am feeling, well, melancholy isn't perhaps the right word, but close. Pensive? Contemplative? I have been in this state for nearly 5 days now, and this is my homage to that feeling--this is my way of capturing it, harnessing it. As thoughts flood into my head I desperately try to write them down as quickly as possible, but surely some will get washed away with the tide.

I have just returned from a movie that has altered, or re-affirmed my view of life and the world. It is my second time seeing Cast Away, and I am undoubtably changed. Not so much changed, but perhaps intensely more aware of what is important in life.

All my days equalling 22 years to this point, have told me one day I would ""become,"" but as I'm growing to learn, you never finish ""becoming""--as you learn more and more about life and the world you try things on for size and see how they fit you. It doesn't end--nobody taps you on the head with a magic wand one day and says ""ok, you have 'become', now go and live."" It is the living that fuels the becoming.

That said, there are definitely defining times or moments when one feels themselves ""becoming"" faster or closer to who they think they are. This was one such time for me, watching Tom Hanks live out on screen my dream.

I really battle with the idea of who I am. One day I think I know, the next it has changed without warning. Identity is so difficult because you can't have an objective opinion about yourself, yet only you know yourself well enough to determine your own identity. This leads one to the conclusion that perhaps, though moulded by our nurture, it is indeed our nature that is already planned out for us which we reveal piece by piece, with each successive leg of experience and experiences in life.

One think I know for sure is, I am meant for a simple life. Not simple in that I am a simple person, for I am one of the most complex people I know of, but simple as in that is what I crave, long for and have grown up to appreciate. Despite my sometime wild dreams of wealth and prosperity, down deep I realize the wealth I seek is wealth of life, the marrow, the experience, and prosperity in making a difference on the world I touch.

The movie Cast Away has stirred something inside of me I need to remind myself of more often--the value of simplicity, the necessity to re-evaluate what is really important, and how much our antibiotic, commercialistic, technology-driven society brainwashes us into thinking that if we buy into it, we'll fill a void that can truly only be filled by God, and self-knowledge that comes from *truly* living. This kind of living is one virtually unknown to our North American society but it is one based on need and necessity, and not greed and desire. And when it comes down to it, truly all we need to live is faith, sustenance, purpose and above all else, love.

When we stand at the cross roads of life, there are many paths we could take, and only one we will. As Frost suggests, I shall embark on the one least travelled. My life awaits me along the path, not at the end. ****************************

While you may think I haven't told you anything about the movie, this is everything the movie has purged from me.. and so maybe I've told you more than a plot summary could ever do. If you want an opinion, form your own by seeing it, and experiencing it. It may cause you to re-evaluate your self, and your life. Remember, the depth of the movie is only as deep as you allow it to penetrate, and it's strength comes from understanding that it's ""Cast Away"" and not ""Castaway"". ""I know what I have to do now. I gotta keep on breathing, because the sun will rise in the morning, and you never know what the tide will bring."" --Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away""",10
4 January 2001,Very Engaging,"""CastAway"" was gripping from start to finish. I was very drawn into the story and I really cared about what was to become of Tom Hanks' character. Hanks, by the way, was brilliant yet again and showed his fantastic talent even in a film with limited dialogue and interaction with other characters. The film direction and cinematography were also outstanding and the plane crash sequence was, well, very intense to say the least. Overall it was a very good movie with an engaging and engrossing story, superb acting, and a great message to end the film. Check it out, it's worth it.

8 January 2001,Incredible!,"I thought Cast Away was simply incredible. What I liked most about this movie was the way it handled the situation and its cinematography. First, I believe if someone were to be stranded, there situation would be played out similar to Chuck's. No pirates, natives, snakes, buddies, abundant food supplies, and other plot devices every other movie of this genre uses. It is a man alone on a small island left to himself (and a volleyball). Hanks played this part so convincingly, I felt as if his character was always just teetering on the edge of insanity. Myself and others I saw this movie with felt real sorrow when Chuck loses Wilson. I felt this movie had a very strong ending. I believe it ended at the right point. We see how Chuck adjusts, but what he decides to do with his life is left up the the viewers imagination. I also believed the cinematography was spectacular. Granted, anything filmed in the South Pacific will look beautiful, the filming in this movie captures the feeling of being on the tiny island with Chuck. Four stars!

18 October 2019,Must watch,"It is a nod to Tom Hanks talent that for the majority of Cast Away the only other object or thing in the movie is a volleyball. I'm sure there will be wags who will glibly compare Cast Away to the likes of ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""Survivor"", but, in tone, approach, and overall accomplishment, this atypical Robinson Crusoe tale bears a strong resemblance to one of director Robert Zemeckis' earlier efforts, Contact. No, Cast Away isn't about space or messages from another planet, but, at its core, neither was Contact. Both films ask the same crucial existential question, one that Shakespeare pondered for years: taking all things into account, what does it mean to be human? How do we cope with loss, hopelessness, and isolation, and still find the courage to face the next day? The love and dream of a dead father sustained Jodie Foster's character in Contact. For Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland in Cast Away, it is the promise offered by the smile of his equally absent - and equally beloved - wife-to-be. A magical experience.

19 January 2001,Tom Hanks does it again!,"He found the island that I've wished my whole life I could wash up on...just kidding. But it would be nice to get away for a while, wouldn't it??? ""Cast Away"" was great, I think. Although like so many others it took me a minute to figure out why he took 4 years to escape--duh, the Port-a-Potty provided him with a sail; got him past the reef & breakers, & out on the open sea (my apologies to anyone who has already mentioned this fact, I didn't really read all 312 reviews before mine.) This has been such a bad year overall for films, it was great to see such a wonderful piece of drama.

22 January 2001,"Amazing acting, disappointing story.","The acting was amazing, and I believe it will garner Tom Hanks his next oscar. The film, overall, disappointed both my wife and me, as we were expecting more from the story. More detail, more scenes from the island, more about how he survived. Most of all, we want to know what was in the package he delivered to the woman in Shamrock, TX.

24 January 2001,Too far away from good movie...,"This is the worse movie of Robert Zemekis! Three parts of movie - life before crush and living on island, life on island and return in normal life after. The most interesting part is second, but watching third part, I was very bored. Too much sentimentality and melancholy make movie look like chewing gum without a taste. Maybe movie is only for Americans?

26 January 2001,Admit it,"You like this movie because TOM HANKS is in it. Take away Tom Hanks and you would be spitting foul words with disgrace as you leave the theater.

And for those who disagree, please honestly answer yourself this one question: Are you lonely? Are you connecting with this movie because you see yourself as Hanks, all alone and castaway?

Someday when you are no longer alone, re-watch this movie and see for yourself what a DULL BORING NOTHING movie this is.

3 February 2001,"Good, but it could have been better...","The narrative is just fine and Tom Hanks is wonderful as usual. The film fails in structure. All too often frame stories fail somewhere along the line. Either the frame is stronger than the middle, or, as in this case, the middle is stronger than the frame story. The beginning and end could have been reshaped or deleted and the story would have been all the better for it. The frame feels tacked on almost. As I watched it, I felt as if i were watching a great film just screaming to be let out of this miserable structure. And I am of the opinion that if you are going to cast Helen Hunt, you don't waste her time and ours by only using her for a 30 minute role. She is too wonderful an actress for such a minor and thankless role.

1 February 2001,"A bright, shiny package with nothing inside.","There is nothing below the shiny surface of this movie -- what did Hanks' character really ""cast away?"" He finds no perspective on his life or situation other than a similarity to tidal vicissitudes. He discovers no spirituality of any kind - not even when he buries the man who saved his life. He relates to a ball better than he ever did to his girlfriend or to her memory... & what does that teach him? Nothing that we can see. The strengths he is forced to find in his solitude are a mystery to us (besides making fire) & it's therefore a mystery as to how well or how badly these all-important, basic strengths translate to his ""real"" life, or to his ""new"" self. So again I ask what was ""cast away"" - & what was found? His bland relationship with Hunt's character? That's it? Seems he should've discovered, & cast away, a lot more on that island - & therefore returned home a richer man. Are we ever asked what is really hidden in every man's heart, underlying ""civilization?"" Or what use or meaning there is in a single solitary life? Oddly, no. I found the film sadly, strangely void. A deserted island is so fertile as a dramatic device, & yet it simply framed a film that itself felt deserted.

13 February 2001,Excellent production and splendid settings. Good performance.,"The story line was not hard to follow and was very interesting, but it is very hard to stuff any more since it was already 3 hours long. The viewer's imagination was needed to fill in the rest of the sage.

This film was very hard to work on the outdoor sets. The realities of island living are brutal and difficult to portray. Much of the hardships were left out of the film. Anyone who watched Gilligan's Island would have thought otherwise.

Tom Hanks carried the film on his back and did much better than expected. I agree with most other comments about desiring to see more scenes about Chuck Nolans' integration back into society. I expected more makeup work to display a variety of skin diseases, rashes, infections and at least a skin peeling sunburn! The island scenes captured his injuries well and helped the audience with much of the painful side of the experience, especially the bad tooth scene in the cave. The film needed more pain! It was too sterile after the rescue.",8

2 March 2001,Tom's the Bomb!,"Tom Hanks was able to carry the movie with no other actors for much of the movie. This is a difficult task to pull off so well, because actors generally rely on each other for drama. It is hard for one actor to hold the audience attention for such a long time without resorting to overly broad strokes. Hanks was able to hold the audience attention without giving way to self consciousness. He has proven himself to be a versatile actor with a lot of range.

This performance must be seen.

30 June 2006,"Great theme, bad ending for Tom.","It is a great movie. Much of my feelings have been shared already so won't repeat.

It is however very unfortunate that the shadows of the Sun at the end don't reflect what the the body language seems to indicate.

One is given the impression that Tom will be reaching out to the stain-glass artist but the shadow of the sun is ""Casted"" over Tom's right side of the face. In the previous footage when the car stops at the crossroads, it is facing South -according to her indications of the roads later on- and the sun casts the shadows on the right side of the car. It seems like it will be around 9:30 AM in a Texas morning but then when he decides where to go, his face is logically looking South. Therefore he is not going North emptiness all the whole length to Canada.

Is this an error in the movie, or is it intentional, meaning, he loves Kelly so much that he is going South no matter what? Have a good Trip to Mexico Tom and, hey, try to make sure you will be able to come back once the WALL is built... Well, that is a different story all together.",7
10 April 2001,So many people missed the point of this film,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",10
6 April 2020,Perfect,"Let me first say that I am a huge Tom Hanks fan and see most of his films. I LOVED Cast Away and it's one of my favorites. The photography and story and most of all Mr. Hank's performance make this an outstanding film. For an actor to play scenes with only himself (and Wilson) is just great. Robert Zemeckis is an incredible filmmaker and I just loved this!

The portrail of a Russian FedEx facility is rather funny, yet amazingly idiotic. Shnella Shnella my workers! (hurry up in german)

But anyways who cares, see the movie for yourself, it's a lot better than reading someone's comment.

By the way DVD will include footage of the rescue of the volleyball that was used in the movie. Apparently it wondered off in the ocean and has been spotted by the Coast Guard and successfuly rescued. Have fun watching that on DVD. :)

19 July 2001,The Travail of love,"When I viewed this movie, it was so excruciating to view the movie for the second time. Tom Hanks gave a sterling performance that won a million hearts. He had reached to the heart of the masses that is the beauty of his histrionics. We know that pain has no language, therefore it cannot be expressed, but Tom Hanks gave a terminology to his pain without uttering a word in it. His countenance spoke even the words of his heart. He had really left an indelible mark in us, no doubt in it.

The director really had an audacity to handle this delicate subject and the ending was too hard to bear. In every moment of the movie, we were able to feel Tom Hanks emotions, which is so captivating.

I always wondered what Love is, I was told that love is sharing, caring and sacrifice, which I always accepted, but after viewing this movie, I understood that love is a journey not a destination with needs lot of faith and endurance.

Tom Hanks may have not won his third Academy award, but he deserves a standing ovation, which merits every one's approbation.",9
15 July 2001,I loved this movie! If you have an open mind and a couple hours I think it's a must see.,"I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I had actually read a bad review and wasn't planning to see it at all. Maybe the bad review is what set me up to be pleasantly surprised.

I can probably name on less than ten fingers the movies I actually wanted to see more than once when I first viewed them. This is the third movie I ever rented and then immediately rewound and watched again. I thought it was that good. I had to have more. And by the third time I was anticipating the dialog and I really got a kick out of it!

About the ending.... I thought it was perfect. Some might think it falls short but I love to see things that are open to possibilities. I feel this is a must see for anyone who enjoys a diversion. I certainly do feel the need to get away from time to time. And after what this guy goes through the line at the market definitely doesn't seem so bad.",9

4 August 2001,better than expected.,"Initially I thought a film almost entirely acted out by one person would be boring, I was wrong. On top of Hanks' now regular encapsulating performance, the direction is perfect, even managing to make a scene where Hanks tries to start a fire by rubbing sticks together enthralling. His gradual slip into insanity matched by his 'friendship' with a volleyball is not only believable but also touching. The fantastic photography and the Directors awareness to overlook the tempting schmalz of a typically American ending are the finishing points which create an overall perfect film which will no doubt go down as a modern day classic, and deservedly so. And now I'm off to get a cherry coke.

9 September 2001,Good effort.,"This movie portrays the typical 'stranded-on-a-deserted-island' storyline. I give this movie credit for the following reasons:

1. Realism - while no movie can truly portray an accurate depiction of real life, this movie makes an honorable attempt. A truly believable story overall, but believable in the same way that 'The Old Man and the Sea' is believable... it is so dull that it might actually happen.

2. Creativity - I give this movie a higher rating because of the writers/producers creativity in making everyone's favorite piece of sporting equipment 'Mr. Wilson' an integral part of the plot. Unlike the 'Old Man and the Sea' I mentioned earlier, the leather bound counterpart to the protagonist works much more effectively than a large decaying fish. While the fish is treated more as an object to be worshiped, the volleyball is treated more as a companion, and makes for much better dialouge.

Overall, a good movie. Very respectable performance by Tom Hanks... who incidentally lost a decent amount of weight for his part. Also, this movie is yet another example of his ever-expanding variety of roles and how his characters continue to evolve and mature.",6
28 July 2002,He missed the simplist way of making a fire.,"I found Cast Away enjoyable and thought provoking. But it bothered me that this intelligent and resourceful man missed a simple way to make a fire. He had a flashlight (a Maglite) which provided short lived protection from darkness with its symbolic security of civilization. Eventually, the batteries die and has to work very hard making a fire to feel civilized again. But, if he had removed the front of the flashlight, he could have used it as a lens to concentrate the sun's light and easily have made a flame. The glass cover to his pocket watch and the wrist watch could probably also have served. Since their curves are not as great as the flashlight, it would have taken a little longer.

I'm not going to give away any spoilers because I practice what I preach, but the trailer gives away a major plot point. It has to do with the amount of time Chuck is on the Island. I'm not the first one to complain. You can read what Zemekis said about the trailer controversy on this site. What the F does he care? He still made his millions regardless. These marketers who make the trailers should really think about their spineless decisions and catering to the status quo.

5 January 2021,Pointless pap,"Pointless pap. I was not interested in the main character. I learned nothing about him apart from the fact that he was supposed to be a walking advert for Fedex efficiency. Yawn.

Did he learn anything about himself through his ordeal? No. Was he changed by it? No. I've given it 2 more stars than it deserves because Hanks and Zemeckis gave it their best shot. Zemeckis deserves to work on better stuff than this.

15 February 2002,THIS MOVIE STUNK !!!,"This was one of the most overrated movies ever, how can anyone have enjoyed this is beyond me. Sure Tom Hanks is a terrific actor, but even he could not ""rescue"" this flick. The scene which he was stranded was as exciting as a Tom Green movie, long, boring and made no sense. I was hoping for one good note to end the movie on. Well will he get the girl ? No. (too bad). Well how about: WHAT WAS IN THE DAMN PACKAGE THAT YOU KEPT FOR 4 YEARS, That you had to deliver yourself. What was so difficult about giving us an idea to it's contents ? Could the director at least given this a good ending? Well there is hope about this movie, there is not going to be a sequel. Well if there is I don't think this person will be around, He'll be too busy at the Mr. T film festival.

2 September 2005,Great Story Of Survival,"This has to be one of the best Tom Hanks films i have seen, lots of preparation went into this movie, the amount of weight he had to lose to portray the character in his final years of being marooned on that paradise island where most would Love to take there holidays.

Chuck Noland is the boss of a postal company in America who is total obsessed with time.

Till he nearly losses track of it.

When watching this movie you cannot help but put yourself right where he is, when the plane crashed into the sea there was many parcels which arrived on the beach and none where any real use to him except the football whom became his best friend and companion through those bad and lonely times.

The bit where he caught his leg on a rock or was it coral in the sea just put the topping on how sick he felt.

You are left with the thought, what use would my cell phone really be unless i had a satellite link up.

You will really enjoy this movie it is a must sea, get it sea :-) Dave",9
6 October 2014,"Chuck Noland, an employee for FedEx, is sent on a business trip that resulted in a plane crash","Cast Away does an incredible job using cinematography to convey a message. Film makers using extreme long shots to show distance and the enormity of the island. Close shots are also used to make you feel secluded. They are used to make you feel like there is nothing else around except for Chuck and you as you are watching it. The directors did a create job with just casting one actor (Tom Hanks) and using him without dialogs to portray everything that was going on. There were incredible aerial shots of Chuck standing on top of a large cliff that is over the island and ocean to show how massive that the island itself is and how high up that Chuck is. Panning shots were also used very well to make a specific area of land or body of water to seem longer or bigger than it actually is. Symbolism played a big role in Cast Away. It created multiple ideas in an audience's mind of how the movie could go. The use of natural lighting made the overall film quality better.

If you love wondrous, slightly intense dramas then Cast Away is for you. It does not keep you on the edge of your seat but it keeps your mind always thinking ahead about how this story could possibly end out. If you enjoy just a little romance and not an extreme amount you would also enjoy this movie. This movie is for all types of people. It is not over dramatic and girl like. It is for both guys and girls. If you like feeling a part of a setting this movie will give you that exact feel. If you love adventurous movie shots, such as, views from a top of cliffs and underwater then this is a movie you will come out of wanting to watch over and over.",8
15 November 2015,A must watch thriller movie..!!,"This movie contains lots of thrill and excitement.It starts in a simple mode and then the movie goes to a different level and the events look so original that you will get surprised by some extraordinary moments....Its really worth to spend your 2 n half hours on this movie because it has something to talk about.The movie is giving a good message and is really an eye Opener.The acting was superb and things were looking natural and these are the basic reason that people will like this movie.Good use of the mind and the things.

Enjoyed it! If you are looking for some decent thrill and excitement then go ahead and watch it !!

5 January 2001,Two Hour FedEx Commercial.,"FedEx began to write a commercial - heard they could get Tom Hanks - and decided to make it into a feature film. I for one am very tired of paying to sit and watch commercials. It completely takes away from the movie-going experience. Boooo on commercialism greed. A product shot here or there is okay but this was over-board (pun intended). Otherwise, good cinematography and Hanks is Hanks but he is now a commercial actor in my book.

30 December 2000,"Less action than expected, but a great story...","Cast Away is an interesting story that forces us to think. There are many great shots and nicely crafted scenes in Cast Away, but what I think distinguishes it from most movies today is its willingness to show us a story rather than tell us what we should think and feel. Although I would have liked to hear more of Hanks' own thought process, we're forced to look inward and see how Hanks' character parallels our life. Following the movie we are forced to reflect how we would act if we were on the Island, what we would do if our only true love was lost for years only to reappear, and how relationships lived inside our heads are often perfect but rarely play out in reality. These all happen here and Zemekis wisely enough doesn't show us how they should be resolved, but simply what happens to Hanks' character and how an everyday man copes with extraordinary circumstances both on and off a deserted island.

27 December 2000,"Another good one from Hanks, Zemeckis.","This is one of the best films in a year of mostly oscar-unworthy productions. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis crank out another great movie worth seeing following the success of Forrest Gump several years ago. Cast Away is a significant improvement over Zemeckis' last creation, ""What Lies Beneath"", and Hanks turns in a performance that could score him a third Oscar. It was certainly a dramatic risk for Hanks, who spends over an hour in the movie acting alone, with no costars and no background music.

27 January 2001,Makes you think,"I went to see the movie in hope that it would not be another ""Hollywood"" movie, and I came out of the cinema with a good feeling, a feeling like if you had been there with Tom Hanks. I think maybe the strongest moment was when he lost ""Wilson"" his only ""friend"" in 5 years. Robert Zemeicks have done it again, like he did with ""Forrest Gump"", he made us one with the carracter, and I have to mention Tom Hanks Exellent play. Without him I don't think the film would have the extra spice, it is like the role was made for him. So I think that Tom Hanks is the strongest Oscar candidate right now. I gave this film the film an 9, because it is one of the best film in many years.

3 January 2001,Amazing! (Some spoilers),"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",
4 January 2001,Wilson for Best Supporting Actor,"I want Wilson to be nominated for Best Supporting actor! A supporting actor is there to give depth and help reflect main actors and that is what Wilson does.

Also, this is by far the best Hanks has done in a film. In Philadelphia and Forrest Gump his characters did not have to change much in the way of personality but here... wow!

I kept hoping he would bleed to death or drown (and take your dam volleyball with you too, loser!) but no it just keeps going and going... I usually enjoy a movie that takes its time to tell a story, but this movie takes its time, and goes absolutely nowhere! The last third had me screaming at the screen 'No, no, god let it end!!!'.

17 August 2001,Could it really be Tom Hanks?,"Could this sad excuse for a movie really star Tom Hanks AND win awards. I'm confused. The plane crash scene has some great special effects (If I just gave away too much of the plot, watch the trailer again), but other than that this was a terrible movie. Mr. Hanks has been great in other roles, but playing the part of a man on a deserted island for several years is not only unrealistic, but just downright stupid. This is a disturbing trend for movies, if the only thing required to be nominated for lots of awards is a big name actor, a camera, and a volleyball, what is the world coming to?

10 January 2001,One of The Best Movies and Script I´ve ever seen!!!,"At the beginning of the movie, I thought the picture was just going to be another version of Daniel Defoe´s book Robinson Crusoe, but let me tell you that with Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in the cast, you can feel the movie. When you see Tom Hanks trying to make fire, you notice how we sometimes do not appreciate life as we should, they have to take things away from us to really learn that we only live once.

Something amazing and that you will probably notice is how Tom Hanks really ""workout"" to be able to film the second part of the movie, something similar when he did ""Philadelphia"" with Denzel Washington.

I truly recommend this movie, when I was sitting at the theatre I wanted the story to never end, maybe because I was wishing the end was different, but I guess that´s what makes this movie one of the best.

29 December 2000,What was in the Fedex box?,"Tom Hanks once again proves his superior acting abilities as he holds the audience's attention for the movies entire length. From Moscow to the remote pacific island the audience was engulfed with truly powerful settings and human emotions. The only question that was left in the audience's mind was, ""What was in the Fedex box?"". I believe that the ending would have been better served with a bit more finality. However, I feel it was a bit too open. I would have liked more of a climatic ending. But with that said, my congratulations to Mr. Hanks for another wonderful and refreshing movie going experience.

5 February 2001,A soggy Robinson Crusoe with a touch of Unrequited Love,"Perhaps it's a generational thing -- after all, my moviegoing history dates to childhood in the 30s, so my perspective may be a little warped. But, with all due respect to the talented Mr.Hanks, this is a Robinson Crusoe for the new century that just doesn't work. High tech, yes. SFX, yes. But soggy, soooo soggy. And that dash of Unrequited Love is a tease that just doesn't work either, even when it involves the talented Ms Hunt. Too bad.

10 January 2001,"Watchable, yet incredibly flawed","First off, I will agree with anyone who says the performance by Tom Hanks (And most any other actor or actress in this movie) was quite astounding. However, I feel this movie's problems are ""What Lies Beneath"" (To steal the title from Zemeckis' other film this year). Usually, I am the last person to say a movie is ""boring""; oftentimes, my favorite movies are those with a 3-hour+ running time. At times, however, this movie, to be blunt, is BORING. The reason for this is because all the island scenes are strung together one after another; if the movie were to show one or two island scenes and then a scene of what was going on back home (Say, his friends' and families' reactions to the crash or his funeral), and so on, the pacing wouldn't have suffered so greatly. Second, on this island he has food, water, shelter, and so on. So why is he unhappy? Easy - No human contact. This is where Wilson the volleyball's role was so pivotal. Yet everyone in the auditorium, including myself, could not stop laughing. The movie failed on all counts to show Mr. Hanks' character's grief. I kept drawing parallels between the last 45 minutes of this film and David Croenberg's ""The Dead Zone"". Both feature a character who has been removed from society for a number of years and then is thrown back in, only to find that everything has changed. The movie could've succeeded here. It could've shown in detail what had changed, it could've further allowed Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt to show off their acting chops, it could've shown how the characters dealt with these changes, it could've been a better movie. In 1998's ""The Thin Red Line"", Terrence Malick proved to be quite a visionary director by showing silence and serenity and how it can get to a person. This probably would've made him the better director for ""Cast Away"". Alas, we'll never know. All in all, this isn't a bad movie so much as it is a disappointment. It's nice that Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis can make exceptionally good movies; it's just a shame this isn't one of them. ***",
3 January 2001,Disappointing,"I am sorry to say, especially with all the hype thrown at this film, that I did not like this film. Mainly the problem is the film tried to go somewhere, but left me hanging on where. Most of the actions Hanks takes on the island the film doesnt fill us in on what he is trying to accomplish, and by the time you figure it out, he is on to his next action. At the beginning they could have had him talk to himself filling us in on what he's trying to do. It does get a little better when he talks to Wilson. They just didn't fill in enough for the viewer, they left too much up to the viewer to figure out. And the ending once again, just leaves the viewer in the middle of nowhere trying to figure it out. All in all, disappointing.

26 December 2000,This movie was not as good as it could have been . . .,"I went into Cast Away with expectations I would see a decent movie. And I did. But I did not see a great movie. I am a big fan of Hanks, Hunt, Zemeckis, and Broyles - and they all could have done more. Hanks and Hunt did as well as they could with below average scripting and direction. I was disappointed the movie did not really deal with Hanks mental strain and scarring that no doubt would accompany living alone for 1500 days talking to a volleyball, and I was also disappointed with the movie's nonchalance of simply reinserting Hanks back into society after his 1500 days alone. I think there were some psychological gems missing in the movie that would have made it great. (Also, Hunt's southern belle accent fades in and out from scene to scene - annoying).

The crash scene had me in as much of a fetal position as I could muster in my seat. I do not believe that this is Oscar material though, as compared to some of Hanks' previous works. It is no Philadelphia or Forrest Gump.

16 August 2001,Tom Hanks' best performance,"I absolutely loved this movie! It spans the universe of human emotions, from love to despair, then determination, hope & perseverance...a movie where you can laugh and you can cry. Beautifully directed and with a terrific score that gives a unique poignancy to scenes depicting the most extreme of human emotions, this movie proves that you don't have to have non-stop action to create a beautiful & moving film...rather unique in today's film industry. Anyone who is not moved emotionally while following the travails of Tom Hanks' characterization of Chuck Noland in this movie should have his heartbeat checked. Tom Hanks has given us many wonderful performances, but this one is his best!

27 December 2000,What a challenging film,"Very good film and very surprising that Hollywood chose to challenge the viewer so much. This is definitely a film that makes you think ... it sure doesn't present everything up front for the 'lowest common denominator' movie goer as most films do.

I was amazed in reading the comments on this Db that nobody pointed out how much Hanks'character's experience on the island mirrored the centuries of experience of ancient man in the Pacific. The learning to create fire, the way to get fresh water, eventual speech (notice how long on the island Hanks doesn't speak ... only when some of his most basic needs have been met does he move up Maslow's hierarchy), and the creation of his own idol/god in Wilson. His own life depending upon fate and the whim of the tides. The story is that of the evolution of man.

Moreover, take his time on the island and compare it to what he had before he got on that plane. Juxtapose the two and I think the movie makes a strong comment on how far we've come standing on the shoulders of millions of years of evolution. We've forgotten how we got here and the movie attempts to remind us. We're so far into self actualization that we'd all be lost if all our 'stuff' was taken away.

The love story that continues long after the film ends (which is left up to us to create) could be the greatest present this film offers. Helen Hunt's character isn't developed because the viewer isn't supposed to grow too attached to her. We are meant to dwell on what may be down the road for Hanks and White.

All that and the commentary on God or fate (whatever you believe) versus random occurrence. Is there any measure of control exerted by us in our own lives, is there a guiding force, or is it all the natural whim of the universe? This movie really let's you begin to ponder all of this, but doesn't force you to think just one way. I like movies like that.",
20 December 2000,"Thoughtful, brilliant, and original film--a must-see","I saw the Austin premiere of Cast Away yesterday, and have been haunted by it since. It is a profoundly moving film about one ordinary man's struggle for survival, not just of the body but of the heart and mind, at the hands of an indifferent Fate. It is alternately funny, unnerving, gruesome, beautiful, and poignant, and at all times believable. I cannot recall another picture from a major studio this spare in terms of script and style--it is a daring and refreshing movie. Tom Hanks as Chuck makes the story compelling, carrying more than an hour of the picture by himself with little dialogue and no soundtrack besides wind, waves, and rain. The film can be enjoyed purely for the entertainment value of watching Chuck become lost and find his back to civilisation (no spoilers here, folks), or it can be explored for many layers of meaning: about relationships, about destiny, about ingenuity, about inspiration, and about our basic humanity. The movie is not heavy-handed with its message; you take from it what you put into it, and the audience is expected to work at it a bit. Even the title is multi-faceted . . . but don't be daunted. See this movie; see it many times, as I plan to do.",10
2 January 2001,Disappointing,"If the makers of Castaway were trying to convey how boring it is to be stranded on a deserted island -- they did a fabulous job. The pace of this movie is mind-numbingly slow and the characters were undeveloped. All we learn about the protagonist in the beginning (which is just one long Fed Ex plug) is that he's obsessed with his job and time...more time was spent developing his relationship with a volleyball than the love of his life Helen Hunt.

24 December 2000,"It's not a movie about merely surviving, but really living.","This movie isn't called ""Castaway"", as in someone who's lost on a desert isle, it's ""Cast Away"", as in something that has been discarded with time. Chuck Noland never wanted to ""commit the sin of turning his back on time"" when, in fact, time turns its back on him. This isn't a movie about merely surviving a four-year imprisonment on a deserted island, but about whether that survival is worth it. It doesn't take long for Chuck to figure out if he can survive or not, but it takes him the entire four years to decide that that is not enough.

Chuck Noland's life is taken away from him twice. Both times he has to rebuild and discover a new reason to live. He learns, through these ordeals, that it is alright to turn your back on time, but to never let the moment pass you by.

22 January 2001,Whats so great about it?,"Having expected a great movie i went to the theatre and what i saw was an average movie. Not more. Thre was a plot which did never reflect a conflict it touches. Neither the problems of a man who has to cope alone on a lonely island, nor the conflict of a woman, who has to decide between two men... This movie does nothing of all. It shows for about 150 minutes a story, with time lapses that avoid to feel really into the problems of its protagonists or even to feel into one aspect of these problems... What does the movie want to be? A adventuere film of a new Robinson Crusoe or a movie about inter-human conflicts? It seems to me that the movie can't decide between both, wants to be everything and therefore is nothing of both. So, really: Whats so great about it?? Average!

1 October 2012,There is NO such company as FedEx in Russia,"Nice movie but the whole part about the Russian FedEx brunch in Russia is a total bummer. There is no such company here. FedEx is totally useless in Moscow and other parts of Russia. So, there is just a nice story about NO existing FedEx and there dreams to be worldwide. But Tom Hanks is surely cool. Nice story about a nice guy who brought some present from snowy Russia. Finally the true part is that FedEx never cared about its employees and clients. FedEx would dream about being in Russia, but the only company really works worldwide is DHL. That's the best courier service - much better than FedEx. Some day FedEx decide to lie about it's services and they failed even here.

It is one of those movies that you would be willing to postpone going to the restroom just so you can see what's going to happen next. I would give it a strong 8 on a 10 pooint scale.

23 December 2000,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to an inspiring plot and a unique role for Hanks, but this movie was disappointing. Though the film was over two hours in length, I couldn't help but feel that a lot of content had fallen gracelessly to the cutting-room floor. Time as a concept seemed to flip-flop senselessly, particularly when Hanks' first few compelling and frightening weeks on the island abruptly end and we are informed (with an awkward subtext) that four years has transpired, leaving Hanks lean, mean, and slightly demented.

Some scenes with his ""co-star"" Wilson were touching. Others were contrived. And Hanks' pathetic, throaty cries as Wilson metaphorically drifts away reminded me more of his character in 'The Money Pit' than anything else. It was hard to take him seriously. And I won't even mention the silliness of Hanks' cetacean buddy, who seemed to magically appear when he was needed most.

Finally, there is Helen Hunt, who seems to be the flavor-of-the-moment in Hollywood, but in this film she is poorly cast. Her performance lacked the true grief, desperation and elation her character should have demonstrated.

Overall, this movie was disappointing. I expected a more riveting performance from Hanks, but the film's editors and writers should accept a greater share of blame for the oft-contrived shallowness of what should have been the best film of the year.

See it, but wait for the video.",
23 December 2000,Zemeckis does it again.,"My favourite Zemeckis films have always been Contact and Forrest Gump. Now his new film Cast Away is added to that list. Cast Away is the ultimate Man vs. Nature epic. This films starts off with Chuck Noland,(Hanks) a Fed Ex executive who takes his job very seriously in Moscow pushing everybody to make their deliveries on time you find out alot about his character in the way he handles his job. He is a person who always has to be on time. When he returns home to Memphis you meet Kelly Frears (Hunt)who is Noland's girlfriend. During a dinner party with family and friends Noland is unexpectedly paged and has to go to somewhere off the east coast of asia to deliver some mail. Hanks and Hunt quickly exchange christmas gifts in the car on the way to the airport. During the very realistic and intense airplane crash into the Pacific Ocean Hanks finds himself stranded on a uninhabited island. The movie takes a daring turn here. The film becomes a one man show as Hanks finds himself stranded. This could make or break the movie for you. Hanks now does what he does best to make this a very entertaining one man show. During his stay on this island you will laugh, cry, and most importantly think about what is in store for this very entertaining character. The comic relief comes from a volleyball named Wilson with a face painted on it with Hank's blood. Cast Away is really everything the summers blockbuster The Perfect Storm was not. I didnt really feel for the characters in perfect storm. Hanks pulls off the role of Chuck Noland magnificently. The cinematography make you feel like you are with Hanks on the island. And best of all Robert Zemeckis's directs this film with so much genius and poise he becomes one of the best at what he does again.",10
25 December 2000,A real waste,"This movie had the potential to be truly great. A great cast, great special effects, and an original plot were all in place. Unfortunatley, the execution and the details were poor and it seemed as if the script was written in a rush without any thought. Tom Hanks' character finds himself on a deserted island after a plane crash. From then on he acts as a man with no brain. Upon finding numerous FedEx packages washed up on shore, he stacks them up and opens them days later, including one that he NEVER opens!!! Upon finding a flashlight, he sets it down, while on, and promptly falls asleep, letting the batteries burn out. Left with a small rubber raft, he takes it out into the obviously huge waves, puctures the raft and his leg in the process. He does manage to produce fire, but is then seen four years later eating raw fish. I guess the fire thing got old, huh? After being on the island FOUR YEARS, he gets the idea to BUILD A BOAT. Only four years to think of that. Intertwined in all this is an ongoing conversation with a freaking VOLLEYBALL. He finally builds the boat and gets out into the open sea. He loses the volleyball and weeps uncontrollably, and then decides to throw away his oars and lay there and give up. (Funny how the volleyball is everything, but those oars don't mean a whole lot.) Miraculously he is found and the movie grinds to an end. By the end I was so frustrated I wished he had died.",
23 December 2000,Very nice indeed,"this is a great movie, the best in a long time. ready for an experience that you only have once in a long while at the movie theatre? go see Cast Away. The collaboration of both Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis together again is wonderful and enchanting. with the flavour of humour that these two bring to the screen, makes be wonder why this is only the second movie together. get out and see it will yah!

25 December 2000,95% of the movie is superb,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",
21 July 2002,A Three-hour long Fed Ex commercial,"I don't remember being so bored from a movie. The only good part in the movie I thought was the actually island, but that was only like a quarter of the movie. The other three quarters were brutally slow. The lead up to Hanks getting on the island, and after were so tiring to watch.

And if that wasn't enough we're forced to look at Fed Ex logos and packages throughout the whole movie.

26 December 2000,"Interesting, but there could have been more","With a great actor in Tom Hanks and a good story line, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more substance in this movie. There were many opportunities to further develop the story after his return. Don't get me wrong, because this was still a highly entertaining movie.

26 December 2000,"Is it ""Cast Away"" or ""Castaway""?","This is an interesting, stimulating movie. I don't think I would be spoiling any part of the plot by telling you that the middle third of the film should be titled ""Castaway."" Hanks' character is stranded on a deserted isle and we experience his efforts to survive. This portion of the film IS interesting, but I thought it went on too long.

Now what follows may spoil the outcome, something the trailers (in uncharacteristic fashion) have not. The most intriguing portion of the film is the last third, when Hanks' character returns to modern society and then is forced to confront being cast away (two words). This is the portion of the film where we really begin to empathize with the main character. Most of us have not had to face nature one-on-one, but all of us have had to face some form of rejection, or being cast away. Zemekis could have made a truly Oscar caliber movie (though I don't doubt that this will receive a nomination) if he had focused on this all too human experience, rather than the intricacies of raft construction.

30 December 2000,"My spiritual connection with the movie, and my recommendations.","I thought Cast away was an incredible movie. The kind of movie that leaves you numb and motionless in your seat. The team of Robert Zemeckis as director and Tom Hanks as star once again, touched me in the same way that Forrest Gump with its epic style cinematography did before. The story of a man who is cast away from a life of convenience to a life of extreme conditions that test his will to survive. When I was watching the film I kept questioning myself, questioning my capabilities if I were thrown into the same situation. Would I fight to stay alive or just give up? I certainly wouldn't have relied on a volleyball, but it was a nice touch and this is a nice movie I'll give it 4 *'s a definate don't miss.

6 January 2001,"Slightly shallow, but a good ride.","This is a GREAT film. Being that the majority of films of 2000 were not that great, this is a shoe-in for multiple Oscar nominations.

Tom Hanks gives a great performance, really making us feel as though we're there with him... as though our fates are entwined with his. His ability for acting shines in this role.

The greater part of the movie rests in mostly silence, as we watch Hanks' character, Chuck, struggling to live on the tiny island which has become his prison. What's interesting about this is that it rips away all the advances and advantages we as a human race have gained, leaving Chuck to learn all over again how to survive.

Rarely have I been actually hurt when I've seen a character on screen experience pain. One scene in particular which makes the audience cry out is when Chuck loses Walter. I doubt there was one person in the theater that wasn't hurt... wasn't hoping against hope that Hanks would get him back, and was almost in tears when he didn't.

Granted, the plot of this film is not complex, and does not require much thought, but that's not a bad thing. Tom Hanks' acting ability turns what could have been a mediocre role into one of depth, making the viewer sympathise with every hardship he must endure.

One thing I've heard many times over is how bad the ending is. Why? Because it's not 'happily ever after?' It is NOT a warm and cozy ending... it's not made to make us feel good inside. It's realistic. And to those who scoff and Hanks' sadness, you've failed to really FEEL his character. Put yourself in his shoes. How would you feel?

Want a funny movie? See ""Dude Where's My Car?"" Want a movie with a happy ending? See ""Gladiator."" Want an emotional movie to envelop you and truly tie your feelings into knots? See this one.

You will not be disappointed.",9
15 January 2001,Definitely worth it!,"I thought this was a great film. Tom Hanks was brilliant. I liked the way the director brought in an element of comedy in a film which was really quite serious. Before I saw the film I was told that it wasn't great but I always believe in giving films a chance and I'm glad I did with this one. The only fault I found with it was that the ending was a bit dragged out. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who doesn't mind sitting for 2hrs 20mins!!

2 January 2001,It only seemed like four years.,"Tom Hanks is a consummate professional who will go to whatever extreme necessary to be his character. His only flaw in this film is picking the script. Is it possible to sustain audience involvement for 60 minutes of one person on a deserted island - no people, no animals, not even snakes, lizards and bugs? Four years is a long time to watch a movie.

It made me so upset I almost left the theatre. We shouldn't have to pay for a film with that much advertising. Secondly, the theatrical trailer showed the whole dang film, beginning, middle and unfortunately the end. And my last bitter comment was the ""four years later"" that came up. I felt robbed when that came on screen. What happened? I wanted to see his interaction once he is rescued. Oh well, guess it's not my movie.

6 January 2001,It's about DIVORCE,"A remarkable film, truly inspired and amazingly executed. This is no ""teenager"" movie! You have to be wise enough to appreciate life, love and loss... in short you must have LIVED to understand it. Most of the viewing crowd (young and old) hasn't the wisdom and will not understand even 10% of this movie, all they can get out of it is the superficial.

If you didn't understand The Green Mile in all of it's deliciously complicated splendor, you will fail to undertstand Cast Away... yes, I mean ""Cast Away"", not ""Castaway"". But for those of you who have gone through the pain of IMMEASURABLE LOSS, you WILL understand.

I said it's about divorce, because that is the journey of loss I related to. Some of the more obvious symbology that alludes to this thesis are the divorce certificate in the FedEx box (his job leads to a divorce), the dead pilot's family picture (there is no wife in the photo), the island represents his despair and loneliness at being ""cast away"" by his wife, but at the same time the island is a sanctuary which allows him to experience and reveal his true ""self"". Further, the island (lonliness and separation) feeds, protects and cares for him over time so he can grow strong to meet the challenge of the waves (change/journey). Finally, the raft represents the promise of a new life, the volleyball the old self, the paddles represent letting go and accepting God/Fate/reality, and the whale is the confidence that there is a spirit/guide/guardian/angel watching over us (all we have to do is listen).

The movie is beautifully made and has a beautiful message... SURVIVING LOSS. Whether that loss is the loss of a loved one because of divorce or through physical death, this movie is about surviving the greatests depths of despair, and surviving our inner psychological worlds ... not our physical worlds.

Those of you who have, will know what I mean.

I felt this could have been a much better movie if there had been more action taking place while he was stranded on the island and it would have made the movie much more interesting.

19 January 2001,Thought Provoking,"I don't know what you've heard but most of the critics are raving while many ordinary folks seem to be rather disappointed. I read one review by a member of the public who was moaning about a poor script, god only knows what he was expecting when it's a story about a guy stuck for years on his own on an island!!

Anyway to state the obvious and provide some perspective this is not a special effects movie, but the scenery is impressive and the cinematography is quite often excellent. The script is of course thin but the small amount of character interaction is largely convincing and you can relate to the two main characters.

To sum up, this movie is trying to make you think and sympathise, if you just sit and stare at the screen with brain disengaged you will either fall asleep or just get incredibly bored.

The film wasn't exactly what i had expected but the more i thought about it afterwards the more i realised how good a film it was. In terms of making you step back and assess your life this film is almost as good as It's a Wonderful Life, it's just a shame that the effect wears off.",
14 April 2006,cast away by Dadou and Thomas!,"We liked Cast Away because it's an adventure film.

Chuck Noland succeeded to change his way of life.

The story is interesting because we saw a man facing his loneliness.

Tom Hanks perfectly plays the part of the adventurer.

Some scenes are funny and others are a little disgusting.

He is so lonely that he speaks to Wilson , a volleyball ball .

We loved the moment when he discovers fire.

We don't see time passing during the film.

We advise this film to those who like adventure films.

Nice Film!",9
1 February 2001,nothing more than a boring commercial,"Let me start with the positive stuff about this movie: The music is (like in Forrest Gump) absolutely great and always fits to the scenes. But that's about it. The main bad thing is, that this movie had the chance of being good. But not one of the things that could have been interesting was brought up. At first we have a guy who finds himself on an island. But just after he finds out how to survive physically, we read ""4 years later"" as a subtitle. His whole psychological development is presented with the fact, that he talks to a volleyball named...(I won't take part in the product placement, that p... me off during the whole movie.) I mean, we got a guy with no one to talk to 4 years, with no courts or people judging his actions, that's stuff you can make a great movie out of (something which also challenges the actor instead of just having him lose 50 pounds). Ok, we will not see what he did during this 4 years, the story carries on. He now decides that 4 years are enough and that he wants to go back. And then, there's another situation that could have been interesting, but he also finds back into real life after 4 days or a similar period. I have no problem with his decision to go on with his life without his wife, but his period of inner struggle is so short in this movie, so that you can not appreciate his decission as much as it deserves. Besides all this, imagine the movie would have had all that stuff. Could you the have enjoyed it? Not me, as long as half of the time I can always read Fed-E... on the screen. This is something so sad, as Tom Hanks should have enough money, to act in movies with less product placement and a bigger stress on the story. I guess I just expected way too much of a director actor couple that once made an awesome movie named ""Forrest Gump"".",4
22 January 2001,"Hey, I really liked it.","I was fairly skeptical that a movie containing a lengthy portion about a guy by himself on an island could hold a viewer's interest. But, wow, it really worked. I was fascinated by all the things that Tom Hanks' character was doing. Also I found myself tempted to talk to the screen to give the guy ideas! A couple of people who I talked to after the movie said that only Tom Hanks could have pulled off that role. Yeah, I think so too. Tom Hanks did a great job. I think that Tom Hanks might receive a nomination for Best Actor (wow, once again) for his role in this film.

23 January 2001,"Gripping, moving, eye-opening","This film made me understand how art was ""invented"", how man discovered the usefullness of tools, why man gives such immense mythical sense to the symbols he invents. Cast away on a desert island, alone in the most absolute meaning of the word (no other animate creature (accept fish) ever comes across Hanks' path during his stay on the island), jet-flying, hard-working Hanks is reduced to the state of primitive man. There is nothing around him which can help him survive. His landing on the island is his DAY ZERO. However, fate first comes to his rescue when he is unsuccessfully trying to break the hard shell of a coconut with a piece of what appears to be volcanic rock. The rock splinters, but what remains in his hand is a piece of rock which has a sharp edge...a knife!! From then on he can split open his coconuts with ease. (It seems that coconut and fishes are the only things Hanks eats on the island.)

Hanks seems to be extremely scrupuolous in his profession. He only opens the packages which drift into the island with him after a few days, not at once. In one of them he finds a volleyball, for which he cannot figure out any use.

Sometime later, Hanks angrily hits this volleyball with his hand full of blood after he cuts himself while trying to get some fire burning. The red hand-shaped stain on the ball appears to Hanks as if it were a face...and so it becomes his friend and companion on the island...Wilson! The attachment Hanks develops to this symbol will be very evident later on in the film.

I believe that there are just good films, and bad films, nothing else. This is a good film.

Hanks has reached another dimension in his acting, and really I doubt whether there is any other actor around nowadays who can so easily adapt himself to such varied roles as being a simpleton in Forrest Gump, an astronaut in Apollo 13, and a modern-day Robinson Crusoe in this film. Marvellous!

Well, what can I say? I think this comment is long enough as it is! GO SEE THE MOVIE!",8
23 January 2001,Didn't know if I liked it or not as I walked out,"Then as I was driving home and thinking about the movie a little more, I realized that this movie, unlike any other movie I had ever seen) kept me glued to my seat without having a disaster around every corner. The two movies to which I got dragged this past year ended up being the two best movies I saw. Gladiator was great, with Maximus's fall from glory and rise to victory once more... and then I went to see Castaway.

Castaway managed to keep my intention without the tenseness of a movie such as Jaws. It was so refreshing to sit back and enjoy a great movie without disaster after disaster. Chuck walks through the water on the rocks with blood gushing from his leg... no shark attack. He stands on the edge of the rock cliff... no slip of the toe to send him over. He sails out to sea once more on his makeshift raft... he's still laying on that raft when he gets rescued.

Yes, a movie can be refreshing, exciting and riveting without all those movie disasters we've all come to expect. Two thumbs up to Hanks and Zemeckis for a wonderfully made film. I would pay $10 to see it again.",
25 January 2001,hope is in the box,"I liked the movie! Tom had my undivided attention for 145 minutes and I am a critic of the Survivor concept! I think the movie is so popular because everyone can relate to the isolation, loss, confusion and despair that life can offer. Tom had to decide what to do at year #3 when he was at the pinnacle and when he saw Helen Hunt after 5 years away. He had to find a way to move on even though it was as difficult as living on the island.

I realize there were many rational questions. Why wouldn't he open a box after 4 1/2 years of looking at it? How could he survive without a good supply of fresh water? How could he make it on a raft ( even though the island is only 25 miles north of Nada in Fiji!!!!). They did actually have to stop filming several times to let boats pass!! I think it is a testament of the human spirit and a great movie!!

Also I found there was a lack of plot line. You never saw what the other side was doing to find him. I like and disliked that. It was most certainly a one man show , and Tom Hanks did a GREAT performance , but with a little bit more footage and script this movie could have been better. PS. Close your eyes for the teeth extraction scene! OUch !

28 January 2001,A big long advert,"I was disappointed by this movie, Tom Hanks is very good as usual but the film is somehow too long and you end up with the feeling that you have been watching the world longest advert for FedEx. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of good in this movie and the survival on the island is nerve cracking.

30 January 2001,could a good movie kill us?,"first of all, i have to advise that my english writing is not fluent as i would like. in the second place, i think that loneliness as well as fear of living are concepts not easy to be filmed. well, nobody says that CAST AWAY is a masterpiece, but also i've seen that nobody made a proper objection in this list. i'm afraid that there was superficiality of arguments and too much criticism by the people who stuck on things such as the marketing plane of fedex or the actors role in this movie. i struggled rather a lot in my life, and i still feel completely alone: there isn't a family, a friend, a job, a work or a religion that could calm or satisfy me. this feeling doesn't leave me a second in life and i think also that doesn't exist a remedy to this. never it will be. the final ppp of tom hanks could be a plausible answer to who understand what i have affirmed before. you can't fight it, so why don't you accept it? in addition, this film got all the faults of hollywood industry's films: a budget too big, many ""commercials"" in it, and so on. but it gives a strong, really strong, sensation, that never let me quiet during the film: feeling of angst. this ""artificial"" and commercial film can give me the same sensation i had during the worse moments in my life so that i feel worried for two reasons mainly: the first is, how long establishment could manipulate feeling and emotions and secondly what they would to achieve. spectators, especially young people, are gonna be more and more disillusioned of this kind of ""stories"", and that is a pity, really. i say that is a pity because this side of industry is gonna ""kill"" every part of good feeling or mood inside us. anyway, i appreciated this film, more than it was expected.

30 January 2001,Blows me Away,"i cannot help but agree that the first 2/3 of the movie is particularly moving without much of the usual cliches.

the plane crash and thereafter is so realistic that i was actually scared like by a horror movie.

The scenes on the island were without music or effects and it is SO RIGHT to portray it that way. I could almost feel Chuck's solitude.

I actually cried a little when Chuck lost Wilson at sea; something i don't usually do these days at the movies.

Unfortunately, the whole part when he went back to Memphis was done all wrong. How i wished it was better.

5 February 2001,A better end for a perfect movie!,"Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",
1 May 2006,Tom Hanks does it again,"As it seems with most of Tom Hanks movies... he is reaching for a role that will get him an Oscar or nomination he never takes any roles that don't stand a chance at winning the Oscars.

though there are some humorous parts in the movie... it is nothing that was Oscar worthy.

The story isn't written that well and tom hanks' acting isn't on par with many other actors at this time, such as Clive Owen.

Other than this that the rest of the cast doesn't do nearly as good of a job as selling the role they should be able to.

Of course it also seems that they tied on a major company such as FedEx, which although pays for some of the movie it kind of sells out the story.",4

13 January 2006,A FedEx Commercial,"The movie was very good, but I couldn't help but be very bothered by the obvious FedEx commercials with which the entire movie is packed. Two scenes were particularly disturbing: (a) in the beginning when Chuck trains the Russian staff on the corporate values of FedEx; (b) well surpassed by the final scene when he delivers the FedEx parcel after all... pathetic). They must have paid a fortune for the movie and in the credits - no FedEx to be seen! Thus mark 3 out of 10. Otherwise, it would have been a higher mark! They could have gone for a fictitious parcel delivery firm and they just about might have made it for an Oscar. It's also surprising of Zemeckis to have allowed this... I remain quite puzzled. A pity thought!

13 February 2001,Good Effort,"A brief scan over the premise of this movie brings of concern. Can one man really be entertaining for all that time? How interesting can four years on an island be?

However, I was pleasently surprised, but not overly. Tom Hanks manages to keep your attention, his subtle but significant characted journey is absorbing. The various tasks he must carry out to stay alive are interesting - perhaps only academically and not dramtically. A sense of humour prods the story along.

The direction, for me, is what saves the movie however. Instead of the bright colours of a dream like island, we see shades, pastels. Infact the island is rather grim. Time is used wonderfully, from the fast paced world to the timelessness and lonelyness are expertly portrayed. Silence, black screens, both forgotten devices are used to great effect here. Even the 'four years later' although perhaps cliche, perhaps a little lazy, gives the feeling of nothingness that helps us to feel his isolation.

Although a little too long, perhaps not a master piece, this film has a great deal to offer in its details. Daring in superfical minimalism, and deeply considered beneath the surface, this film will be enjoyed by those who like to work hard with their viewing.",7
14 January 2002,Hanks at his best!,"Judging from other comments already posted, 'Cast Away' has touched as many people as it has left others mildly indifferent. I watched it in the cosiness of my living room, on a pretty smart digital wide screen TV, and found it riveting.

It is a bit long and disjointed, and the least that could be said is that the transitions between consecutive periods in the movie are too abrupt. I guess this can happen when one tries to cover several years in a two-and-a-half hour piece, but the lack of smooth transitions destroys the rhythm of the movie.

So why did I find it riveting? First and foremost, Tom Hanks makes an outstanding Robinson Crusoe. Credible from the first minute to the last, he adds to a great acting performance the physical prowess of changing body shapes. One minute a chubby, over-fed executive, the next a survivor close to starvation.

The credibility of his acting brings out one of the main messages of the movie: Corporate America and the pseudo-comfort it creates (but which comfort does Chuck Noland enjoy when travelling from continent to continent in the back of a FedEx aircraft?) mainly serves the purpose of alienating human beings by destroying their relationship to nature.

Ok, some of you will find this statement far-fetched, and Chuck Noland certainly did not crash his plane to enjoy a return to nature. However, I took the contrast between a life in the fast lane and the painstakingly slow pace of survival as a reminder that we should not rely on appearances too much, it doesn't always matter if things happen a few minutes too late.

Beyond the thought-provoking aspects of the movie, I enjoyed some superb photography and scenery, as well as a good plane crash scene. What I wasn't impressed with: too many FedEx signs around - but then, this is corporate America and Hollywood.",
19 March 2001,All that you can't leave behind,"I saw Tom Hanks sell me this movie for the second time this previous saturday evening. When you watch a man 'cast away' every major component of his life... one by one... clothes,body fat, human contact, comfort, the pressure of time... a portion of sanity... and then see whats left behind.

The first act plane crash is phenomenal. You will NEVER take your shoes off in an airplane again... or be without a Leatherman tool. :-) When Chuck first lands on the island; i was made to feel like the island itself is a creature... a being... a thing that imprisons... it KEEPS you. On the horizon you COULD be free... but you CAN'T GET there. And you watch Chuck. Chuck is REAL. And so are His frustrations, his pain, his discomfort & his joy in triumph!!When he makes fire... I shouted with him. I, too, find myself wanting to get back to Kelly... to hear a human voice... to be warm at night... to not be thirsty anymore. Chuck's numerous transformations make me feel like i went through them with him. During the second act, after four years has passed... it felt like chuck had crawled into a cave... and what was left was ""all that he couldn't leave behind"" or throw away. Just ... surviving. Staying alive. Then one day the tide brings in his way off. In this film you will watch a man CHANGE. Tom Hanks makes me believe in a character like never before in a film. I BELIEVE him. I BELIEVE he has 'thrown overboard' every thing that was of no use to him in order to survive, in order to LIVE. ""WhatEVER it takes to live"" was what i thought about as i left the theater... and to ENJOY your life, and enjoy every LITTLE thing. Ice. Sheets. A cup of HOT coffee. Human touch. MUSIC! What if i couldn't listen to music for 4 years??? A kiss from a woman! ( again... 4 years? )Savoring every last good thing in my life. In the word's of U2, this film challenged me to, in my own life, throw overboard the worthless junk that will hinder me, and keep ""all that i can't leave behind"" ... and enjoy. Go see it. wait. And then see it again. *** By the way... ( and this is seen in the previews) When Chuck says at the beginning of the film;""We live or we die by The Clock!""... he has a pager with a clock, a digital watch, clocks in the warehouse etc.... and at the end ... notice he wears no watch.",

It touched the bottom of my Heart through various ways, be it Funny, be it Sad, be it Inspiration, be it Being Positive and be it Being In Love.

7 April 2001,"The film, which creates a new value of life","If you had ever dreamed of finding yourself on a deserted island like Robinson Cruso, and you thought, that you'll handle problems better than he did, you will understand, how big was your mistake. When you have nobody to talk with, but just to think about an angel you left and always loved, the only thing you can do is to hope and prey. That is a good film for those who have everything, except happiness, it will learn them to see the real price for common things

28 February 2023,The script is an overlooked gem,"Everyone knows about Tom Hanks, Zemeckis's string of huge successes, Wilson the Volleyball, the beautiful scenery, etc. But what stands out to me about ""Cast Away"" after 20+ years is William Broyles's script.

You're thinking, wait, there's almost no words for much of the film! Right, but when you dig into the script and pay attention to it and to the plot, what you find is a surprisingly profound examination of the concept of time in modern vs. Pre-modern society. You can view the whole movie as a man's transformation, through great pain, into a life that is a rejection of the every-second-matters mania that drives global businesses while also making time spent with loved ones, even friends, fleeting and fragmented.

Broyles gave us a big clue with his title for the script: ""Cast Away."" Where did that title come from? Why isn't it ""Castaway,"" the normal spelling for someone stranded on an island? I pondered over this for years, and finally realized that it's from the famous passage from Ecclesiastes 3 in the Judeo-Christian scriptures, i.e. For everything there is a season (or ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"" by The Byrds, same thing). Verse 6:

""A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to *cast away*""

And there you have it: ""Cast Away"" is, at its core, a meditation on time. Those who find the film boring completely miss the point.",9

26 July 2001,my opinion,"First,I think it is one of the best films I have ever seen. Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors in the history of movie. He plays a very difficult character in the film. Chuck Noland(Tom Hanks) is a successful businessman, who always travels to different parts of the world, that is why he sees his girlfriend very rare. But when this man had suffered a plane crash and has been taken to a deserted island, as his life changes his personality changes also. Tom Hanks just speaks a few words in the film, but it's most difficult to play so ingeniously without words.

27 August 2001,It Took Guts !!!,"Tom Hanks did a splendid job in this film. It took guts to do all that was required from the start to the finish = from gaining all that weight and then letting it ""fall off"" as the film progressed, to being basically the sole character, having the entire film rest upon his shoulders from his performance. That had to be quite a burden. But He pulled it off and did a gutsy job, and it was quite an experience to go through it all with him. After all, WE WERE WITH HIM ON THAT ISLAND. We learned lessons right along with him; and his character's dedication to his job held him together and gave him something to hold onto; after all, he DID deliver that package that he held onto for all those years ! Now THAT'S dedication !!! I loved the film ; watched it 3 times and I'd watch it again !

22 May 2023,Castaway: stuck on an island an stuck in time,"Tom Hanks portrays Chuck, a Fedex businessman with a hectic schedule and lofty ambitions. Although it is a really emotive film, it moves more slowly than a sloth on steroids.

Chuck Nolan is in Moscow trying to quickly spread Fedex's magic as a harried businessman with a full schedule. After an incredible plane accident compared to the rest of the film, he joins a flight home. He is imprisoned on an island.

The pace of the film is incredibly slow, with one scene taking two minutes when ten seconds would have sufficed to achieve the same effect. This film could have reached the top 5 with a different director, bye bye Robert Zemeckis. The FedEx logo was seen in almost every shot throughout the 2 hours and 23 minutes of the FedEx advertisement. A Many of the scenes consist solely of Chuck's locket or a random FedEx parcel with an upset Chuck. There is no drama, just one big issue: being stranded on an island! The movie becomes even more agonisingly slow as a result. What occurs after that, according to the ambiguous ending? As there is no tension, it is hardly a cliffhanger; rather, it is more like the movie ran out of money before it could finish.

He is alone and gradually becoming insane, which is one of the film's most compelling emotional elements. Everyone is moved when he befriends a volleyball named Wilson; this is perhaps the only reason I would see it again. The only real improvements to the film come from Wilson and the plane accident. #JusticeForWilson

Overall, this film should be condemned to remain in the 2000s; if my children wanted to watch it, I would disown them. The survival action genre has been ruined by this film, which makes Bear Grylls look like a girl scout! Go ahead and watch it if you want, but be prepared for your popcorn to vanish before the action begins. My suggestion: Burn everything, keep the next generation from it.",1
20 November 2007,Movie Review,"This movie is about a man who gets stranded on a deserted island. This character is named Chuck, played by Tom Hanks. Chuck works at FedEx flying from country to country making sure that packages get to their destination in the shortest amount of time possible. A couple of days before Christmas he was forced to go on a business trip. As everyone knows that it is always when things are going well that they are bound to go wrong sooner rather than later. Right before he boards the plane he proposes to his girlfriend Kelly, who is played by Helen Hunt. It is on that flight that things go bad. The plane gets trapped in a storm and the pilots are not able to communicate to others through the radio. Somehow after the plane crashing into the ocean, Chuck miraculously survives. Unfortunately the pilots were not as lucky. Eventually while floating on the planes emergency raft, Chuck wakes up to realize that he is on a deserted island in complete loneliness. He then makes a very strong effort to stay alive using every survival skill known to him. He gathers all of the FedEx packages that are washed up onto the beach. At first he plans to keep all of them closed until somebody showed up. Later in the movie he realizes that he might never be found. So he opens up all of the packages except for one and in one of those packages was his new friend: Wilson brand volleyball that he named ""Wilson"".

This movie does an excellent job with the picture and sound. The writers and editors do a great job in making this movie interesting since it is all about one man stuck on an island. Tom Hanks does a tremendous job playing the role of Chuck. It is especially challenging to play this part since there is barely any dialogue. Because of this the writers and editors has to emphasize other aspects. For example, the sound of nature took the biggest role in this movie. There was not one second where you could not hear the sound of the waves crashing into the sand. In this movie Chuck grew as a person and fought for his life every single day. What kept him motivated was his fiancée Kelly. One of the most brilliant aspects of this movie was Wilson. The volleyball that kept him company, kept him motivated, and eventually became his best friend. Apart from adding more to that story, Wilson also helped bring in more dialogue into the movie. In the end of the movie there is an interesting romantic twist that you would have never imagined. This is all explains why this movie is one of the best movies ever made.",10
13 June 2002,Too many dead heads!,"There are too many movie watchers that have no depth. Reading the last few posts persuaded me not to spend time trying to strengthen the emotional misfits that need their head petted to feel secure.

Most movies including Cast Away have depth beyond the understanding of even the above average person. What a person can not see (feel) when they watch a movie determines the level of their understanding of the story or it's meaning It was an above average movie lost on too many deadheads.

25 July 2002,Survivor,"Once again Hanks makes a smashing hit with the critics and at the box office with his Film ""Cast Away."" ""I'll be right back,"" says Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), to his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) right after he gives her a ring box hinting a marriage proposal when he returns from his business trip. Only Chuck didn't return until four years later. ""Cast Away"" is a film of love and survival that resides on the shoulders of Chuck Noland. Chuck is a FedEx system Engineer who travels around the world to teach the importance of a speedy delivery to other FedEx couriers. During a flight, his plane hits a thunderstorm that sends it into the Pacific Ocean. Only Chuck survives. He floats in a life raft to a deserted island with only a few FedEx packages as the only remains. Robert Zemeckis did an excellent job directing while Hank's did an even more excellent job acting out two-thirds of the movie on his own. The only dialogue during this time is when Chuck speaks to Wilson. Wilson, the volleyball, comes from a left over FedEx package and has a face drawn on with Chuck's blood. This movie has an emotional tug and it makes us feel just like we are on the island with Chuck. The ending to the movie isn't the normal perfect ending. It has a real life twist of how people move on with their lives even after a tragedy. This movie is a survival drama we should not miss.",
20 July 2002,Uplifting and heartfelt film about life and survival,"An excellent work of Zemeckis and Hanks who succeeded in bringing to the screen the emotions without action. This film makes us think about real treasures of the world and our lives in it. An Oscar performance by Hanks, unfortunately, underrated. Splendid!

2 December 2002,Brilliant portrayal of one man's struggle with solitude...,"""Cast Away"" is an excellent portrayal of one man's determination to stay alive, no matter how impossible the situation seems to be. After a freak storm sends a Federal Express plane down in the Pacific Ocean, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is the only survivor. Clinging to an emergency raft that he found during the plane's decent into the raging ocean, he eventually drifts onto a deserted tropical island. He quickly learns how to survive in this harsh environment but reality sinks in as he realizes that there can be no rescue from this isolation. After a while, Chuck begins to lose what sanity he has left and befriends a volleyball (Wilson) that he accidentally imprints with his bloody hand. Chuck and Wilson remain on this island for three long years until the winds and tides are right for getting his handmade boat off the island.

Hanks does a brilliant job of bringing to life the agony and despair of being the sole human operator in complete isolation. His monologues with Wilson (which he actually believes is communicating with him) keep him focused on making the boat and his undying love of his wife (Helen Hunt) keep driving him to strive against all odds.

I give this movie 9 and a half stars out of 10, because the ending is a little too open.",
3 September 2012,Deepest film ever from a Taoist perspective (SPOILERS),"It is all all about shedding the ego. Chuck has a HUGE ego. Not in the sense that he is a jerk or selfish but in the Buddhist way definition of ego: he think he can control everything (ego) and lives totally in time (ego) and puts his job first, because it creates a sense of order (ego) and so on. He puts more stock in giving Kelly a ring at the car than staying behind to be with her for the holidays because, to the Ego, a ring is more important than the relationship. Ego loves symbols and form more than what is behind them. However, the universe endlessly tests his ego by showing him that he is actually powerless. Which he cannot accept. First, he is in Russia and he gets the clock that he sent himself and it took many days to get there and shows him he is out of control. But he makes that everyone else's problem and even steals a kids bicycle to speed up the package delivery. he is willing to do anything to regain control rather than accept any powerlessness. Then his friends wife is dying and he , again , can't accept his own powerlessness and suggests a doctor to ""fix this thing"". Which, of course he can't. It's death. Since Kelly knows what he loves best, she gives him a watch because time is the only thing he finds valuable (ego). And then the plane goes down. On the island he is endlessly shown how powerless he is, and again wont accept it. He cant make fire, he cant eat, his tooth is decayed. But he wont accept it, he keeps trying to overcome it with reason. He still is collecting packages. Finally, he cant even kill himself correctly. At this point, is his first glimpse at a higher self because, later, when he tells the story to his friend, he say that when he realized that he couldn't even kill himself, a ""warm feeling came over him"" and stayed with him. This is his first moment of enlightenment, a forced realization that he is totally powerless and thus a moment of forced alignment with something higher. Then it takes four more years of ego battering before he has let go of ego enough internally to be able to just float where the winds take you (as Lao tze says) ... literally.. as a sail comes in.

But when he gets home, his dormant ego flares up again, as it tries to control the uncontrollable, he still hasn't totally learned. So he tries to get Kelly back instead of accepting the situation. thus he is still on the island in his head which is a metaphor for separateness. ""No man is an island"" The island IS Ego itself.

in the third act, every time his ego flares up and he is trying to control things again ... there is a clock in the background. he is still stuck in time. Again, his ego is pummeled and he must accept his own powerlessness. And then finally, BOOM, it really all comes at once. he lets go. He accepts his own total powerlessness totally and gets in a car and gets to a crossroads having no idea, for once in his life, where he is going. At which point, his angel arrives. His angel tests him one last time. She tells him that to the right is Flagstaff but back the way she is going is ""a whole lot of nothing"" In the end, he looks back toward nothingness (the direction she is going"" and we know he is going to choose the road to nothingness instead of the known destination of Flagstaff, because he has released his ego, accepted powerlessness. He is now capable of drifting powerlessly toward nothingness which is really not nothing at all, it is an alignment with the Universe. Especially so, because the cute girl with the wings lives in that direction and they may fall in love. One last great thing here. When he went to her ranch to leave the package. She has removed the Name ""Dick"" from ""Dick and Bettina"" and this now, it only says ""Bettina"" . From a symbolic perspective, the ""Dick"" (male organ/ ego) has been removed which represent man and power and only the feminine power is left, the return of the feminine power is associated in Joseph Campbell as mans realignment with God. Bettina which in Hebrew means ""God's Promise"". And finally, he stand on a cross. (crossroads) resurrected. Wow.

Moral of the story: To shed the ego, totally accept your powerlessness. You will be tested again and again till you genuinely do this. When the ego is shed, then the true self, the one aligned with the Universe and God. Can emerge and take you where you need to go as you are now part of the whole.",10
4 July 2005,Movie stinks,"I felt like I cast away my money on the ticket. Very little happened on the Island. Tom Hanks was probably more interested in getting to his next feature film instead of doing a quality job of acting in this film. This is a problem with top tier actors. Too many films to star in and not enough time to spend doing a quality job in all of them. The producer thinks that having Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in a film is going to get people into the theater no matter what quality film is produced. The funny thing is that both actors are ""A"" list actors. This film lacks originality, creativity, and is boring. This is more of a drama, than an action film. Tom Hanks is great in Saving Private Ryan and Forest Gump. If you read this review try checking those out.

21 December 2002,TOO LONG,"It is a long time, four years on a deserted island but perhaps even longer for the spectator who does not have Wilson around but who cannot resist looking at his watch too. Robinson Crusoe was a wonderful book but even with an optimistic romantic ending, ""CAST AWAY"" can be disposed of right away.

However, this ISN'T an updated version of ""Robinson Crusoe."" It's an update of Lord Tennyson's mini-epic poem ""Enoch Arden"" which was filmed a half-dozen times during the silent film era.

10 May 2012,Incredible Direction and Performance,"I was watching this movie after 11 years from the date of realize.. I want to rate this as 9/10 because...It is the best.. it makes me involved in the movie... it makes me to think what ll be doing if was in his shoes..my mom used to say, no one knows how to do everything, but they ll learn to do things eventually by the help of the time.. I mean the time is the best teacher of all time, I cannot imagine how I would have survived in the middle of the earth with no living around me, no place to save my head, no place to protect my self, I can hardly swim, its hard to survive with all the supplies in this world now a days.. but I cannot imagine who one can survive without anything to his/her supplies. I ll definitely be screaming all the time with pain and frustration, eventually it ll be habituated though... I ll definitely be singing, moaning, all the time...

I lost so many dear friends and I know how it feels like...to loose only friend no matter what it is, after all staying with Wilson for 1500 days and nights is really painful....

This movie was well directed without any flaws..And Thanks to Sir Tom Hanks for the incredible performance. Overall this movie is awesome...

This was my first movie review, please correct me if I have any flaws.. I would like to improve myself....",9

19 November 2004,A Masterpiece.,"Just as i began watching this movie, firstly i had no idea that at the end of it, i would feel emotion towards it. For me, it quite simply showed what an amazing and influential actor Tom Hanks is when he was the only character viewed for most of the movie (along with Wilson). It was just Tom for a long period of time...and that was bliss. Towards the end just as tom is escaping from the island leading into his now, Re-married wife Kelly..it made me so sad in parts such as him losing Wilson (how i got sad at him losing his ball i have no idea) but, him losing Kelly and accepting that she cannot be with him, really brought emotion towards the film. I have to say this film i enjoyed 100%. A masterpiece in my eyes.

25 March 2005,Castaway merits a closer look...,"Like a Shakespearean play, the different layers of the story cannot be taken in from a one-time viewing of Castaway. I was looking for a specific film example of some of the ""Hero-Quest"" plot points from Joseph Voggler and picked up this movie for a second viewing. I ended up watching it again with my five year-old son. When Wilson floated away, my son began to cry. Then I began to cry! Damn, my kid got it, and I had missed it. My son understood how ""real"" an imaginary friend is because he was still a child. Hanks has a rebirth on the island and is stripped down to an infantile state. He becomes a child once again. His entire re-evolution is fascinating. I have watched it at least 8 times since and pick up little pieces that I had not caught before. Like a Shakespearean play, there are layers to this one... Just because the film isn't obvious does not make it ""slow."" It's amazing what we expect from movies. I expect a story! This is a story of becoming a human being and learning to live a genuine life. I love it, and still tear up. Give it a second viewing. Look at the symbolism, gestures, and expressed emotions. Pay attention to the details (like the ""birthday card""). Almost a perfect story! Some people simply won't get it. I think even the main character (Nolan at the beginning of the film) would be too ""deadened"" to understand it... It is only through his ""tragedy"" that he becomes a true observer of the gift that life is. That might even be one of the layers. Bravo!!!",9

8 December 2016,Cast Away plot and theme,"Cast Away was released in 2000. Some are the main characters are Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), and Ramon (Paul Sanchez). This film mainly revolves around the main character, Chuck, who gets stranded on an island after his plane crashes into the ocean. This film shows how he tries to survive on this island and try to get himself rescued. The film shows how hard it can truly be to try to survive and the emotional toll it would have one someone. Of course you have to watch the film to figure out whether Chuck survives this situation or not.

The theme of Cast Away is pretty straight forward. It is one that shows human survival when we are forced to try and survive or die. This theme focuses on the idea of the struggle for human dignity. Chuck is put in a position of disadvantage and dealt a bad hand when he gets stranded on the island. He is fighting against tremendous odds for his survival. There are also several other films that have a similar theme to Cast Away's theme. 127 Hours is one film that has a similar theme to Cast Away's theme. The main character gets dealt a bad hand when getting stuck in the canyons with his arm crushed and stuck. His is at a disadvantage and fighting against tremendous odds for his survival just like Chuck was in Cast Away.

There are a couple of film techniques that have relevance to the film's theme. One technique is lighting. There is a darker lighting during most of the movie, which helps show the significance of the theme. If the lighting was bright during the whole film, then it would be harder to portray the significance of this theme. Sunny and bright usually means happiness. You wouldn't want the audience to feel OK and happy during the movie, you want them to feel sad, nervous, anxiety, fearful at times. This way the audience can have a feeling of being there and have a sense of reality of what is going on in the film and about the theme.

The second technique is camera angle. The camera angles changes from the viewer seeing Chuck and his surroundings to seeing what Chuck is seeing, like they are looking through his eyes. Interchanging between these camera angles really gets the audience in tune with Chuck and what he is possibly feeling. Getting the audience involved like this really helps get the theme of this movie across to the viewers. This makes the theme very straight forward. A theme of survival against all odds is a great theme that most audience members enjoy and it works great for Cast Away.",7

27 April 2017,"Pretty good movie, with a great theme!","Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here (behind Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future) with Cast Away. Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren't needed (not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead), but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year, it is worth it.

The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed-ex deliverer who has a fiance (Helen Hunt) and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia, but alas, the plane he's on crashes in the water and, dare I say more (well I can because practically everyone saw the all-revealing trailers)? Well, Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way (probably remenicent of 2001, Hanks' favorite film), and even finds a silent companion named Wilson (a volleyball). That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball, and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay, is one of the films triumphs. The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks' performance. If it was someone else, it would not be as successful, but Hanks gives his all and (as usual) pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances. A-",7
