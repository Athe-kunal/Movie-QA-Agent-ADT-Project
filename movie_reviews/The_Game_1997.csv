6 November 2018,I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one.,"Sean Penn is not the most popular celebrity and has created a few enemies over the years. However, this does not make his performance nor the film ""The Game"" something to avoid...and considering I am no fan of him as a person, the fact I loved the movie so much says a lot. THE GAME is exceptional...and you'd be doing yourself a favor by watching it. THE GAME is one heck of a great film, as I give it a well-deserved score of 9 because it's so well written and entertaining. It is one of the most exciting and riveting films of recent memory. You've got to see this film! I'll say no more because I don't want to spoil it.

12 December 2008,A Classic Thriller,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",10
20 May 2007,"Tight, twisted and tense - one of the most interesting thrillers of the '90s","Having conquered the critics (and the box-office) with Se7en, David Fincher could have ""sold out"" and kept delivering more of the same. Fortunately, he was wise enough to try different paths, and although all his movies can be classified as thrillers there's no real similarity between them, except maybe a common theme of alienation and solitude.

In Fincher's third film, The Game, that solitude is physically incarnated by Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy businessman who is so obsessed with his job he has forgotten everything about the simple joys of life. The only person who still stays in touch with him is his younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn), who is Nicholas' polar opposite in terms of attitude. One night, when they're out to celebrate the elder brother's birthday, Conrad mentions a ""game"" that changed his life and suggests Nicholas participate too, as it would be ""fun"". Though initially hesitant, the latter eventually gives in to curiosity and decides to give it a shot. Within a few hours, however, he will regret it: the ""game"" is actually some sort of conspiracy involving everyone in town. With his assets frozen, his apartment no longer a safe place and no one left to trust, Nicholas must figure out how to solve the problem before it's too late - for him or someone else...

As usual, Fincher makes sure the film works on a technical level, cleverly using camera angles, lighting (shades of red and brown being the dominant color) and editing to keep the suspense alive and the atmosphere conveniently murky. It is mainly this masterful handling of film-making tools that keeps the viewer from questioning the logic of the nonetheless brilliant screenplay, some of the twists giving the impression of a dystopic set-up rather than a plausible situation (and yet the script is supposedly based on a real event). Two other elements contribute to elevating The Game above the average mystery tale: a truly unpredictable, phenomenal ending, in pure Fincher tradition (well, at least until he made Panic Room), and the great work by the leading men, Douglas' paranoid desperation slyly erasing all hints of typecasting (after all, this is not the first time he has played someone who is being manipulated; in fact, one scene explicitly spoofs one of those previous movies) and Penn's smug anarchy anticipating director's masterpiece, Fight Club, and its central character, Tyler Durden (without a doubt Brad Pitt's best role to date).

In short, those looking for a ""different"" cinematic experience should give The Game a try: it might come off as overly cold or contrived at first, but like all of Fincher's movies it deserves a re-evaluation (Fight Club wasn't exactly a hit when originally released) and stands the test of time as one of the most original, smartest films of the '90s.",9
25 April 2000,Michael Douglas at his very best,"""The Game"" took me on one psychological thrill ride after another loaded with twists and turns scene after scene.

Michael Douglas pulled off his best performance as Nicholas Van Orton a man who is approaching his birthday. Upon which he receives an invitation to play a game given to him by his brother Conrad played by Sean Penn. Nicholas reluctantly agrees and soon finds out that the game is more than he bargained for.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film because I never knew who was trustworthy or what was going to happen next, this truly was one film that must be seen by those who enjoy never knowing for sure how a movie will turn out.

""The Game"" is all Michael Douglas and how well he pulls off his role of being the innocent who happens to be in the middle of a game he can't control. However, a really good movie can not be pulled off by one actor, a whole lot of credit should go to Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger for their convincing portrayals in this film.",
2 November 2003,Who Dealt This Mess?,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",6
19 December 2020,A brilliantly executed mind-trick,"I have always loved the Game. It sits right between The Truman Show and The Matrix as these 90's weird deconstructions of reality and sci-fi with a hint of social commentary on media. It was really the decade where TV and movies discovered the awesome power these new images had, and trying to reconcile their own moral hazard (spoiler alert: they did not). In The Game, Michael Douglas' character has basically a feature film inserted in his life. With a rewatch there are some little details that stand out and you realize easily none of this would work for real. But it works for the audience and as such it works as a movie.

I love this movie because it is a great mind-bending trick. The movie keeps the tension up throughout by jumping around whether the Game is real or not. Even in the third act, where there is maybe one switcheroo too many; you get that escalating tension that keeps you engaged.

Structurally the movie may not be the most elegant. This tension escalates not really by anyone's actions but by design. But it is competent enough to let the talent shine. Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance and it's just a joy to watch. He basically plays Gordon Gekko again, with the self-important attitude but also the effortless charm. There is something to 90s Douglas that is frankly mesmerizing, because he offer such a large palette of characters. He can play the everyman gumshoe or the stonyhearted investment banker. And in the Game you can see that kind of transformation on-screen. You can see the veneer of civilization peel off and you're left with the unkempt hair Douglas: the most dangerous variant.

Returning to the escalation of tension, it works that way also because the plot destroys Nicholas Van Orton's life in an escalating fashion. First he loses on his business deal, then his money/fortune, then his brother. Which culminates at the end of the movie: he is a broken man, which leads him to suicide. On the surface, the movie is very ""nineties ennui"" where it throws a business exec in suit and a briefcase in an action movie. The movie's internal logic is built around the fact that his life is very lame and predictable and he gets propelled into these action-movie set piece tropes. But underneath there is a more subtle message critical of the greed and the excess of the 80s. It is a repudiation of Gordon Gekko. It metaphorically kills Gordon Gekko, it throws him off the roof. And I believe the film's morals want to state that life's meaning lies elsewhere than monetary accumulation and wealth.

That is not to say that the movie is leading the masses to the barricades. It is first and foremost an action film, and as such a corporate product, yet it enjoys having a faceless corporation as ""the villain"". But it is similar to Fight Club in that regard; it enjoys the subversive sub-text, without giving it too much credence. Nonetheless, it focuses way more on the mechanics of the plot: who is going where and why, rather than on the thematic elements. And for the most part it holds up as an action movie. And even if makes (forgettable) mistakes, you'll still want to rewatch it to see how well The Game was set-up, and what worked and what did not.",8

18 April 2002,"....and when it was all over, I was blown away","Very few films have captured my attention the way The Game did. Every turn, every corner seemed to have some hint of intrigue and deception. This film would be the life's work for any major film maker, but then again, this David Fincher were talking about.

Years from now, when Fincher is honored with his lifetime achievement award at the Academy Awards, his true fans will always remember this film. It put a whole new twist on the idea of ""plot-twist."" One of the few films me and my father both liked (we never agree on any film).

8 December 2011,"Twists upon twists, amazing filming, stunning acting, and a preposterous end","The Game (1997)

The steely intensity of Michael Douglas comes to play once again here in a role where that determination keeps getting waylaid by the mixed-up birthday present he's been handed, somewhat against his will.

Or against his better judgement, at first, because he does sign off on playing ""The Game,"" which is an experience with a bow. That is, without any good clues about who the players are or why it's quite happening, except that his birthday has come and gone, events begin to happen around him that are inexplicable. And that he can't ignore.

Intensity rules. Douglas, playing the obscenely wealthy Nicholas Van Orton, gets led further and further into the madness and crime and murder of this huge huge charade. Or so it seems.

In a manner the director, David Fincher, is cozy with, reality bends but psychology seems to be solid. That is, you are secure, somehow, in the main actor's head as the world distorts. The main example is of course ""The Fight Club,"" the distortions are almost literal in the more ordinary ""Panic Room,"" and the world is somewhat friendlier in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Yes, these are all Fincher films (as is the brand new American version ""Dragon Tattoo"" flick and the riveting ""Se7en"").

The production and the shooting and editing in particular are all first rate, classic Fincher. Douglas plays his part with conviction and you end up not quite sympathizing with him (he's a spoiled jerk even as his world evaporates) but you certainly are in his shoes, wondering what is going on. It's crazy and exciting and certainly baffling for a viewer--which is part of the game, actually. The viewer is another layer in the layers of perceivable reality.

And then it just goes too far. In a way, the film is preposterous from the start, but yet you go along with the idea because very rich people have very unusual lives, and maybe this kind of mind-trip birthday present with lots of people participating could happen. Money moves mountains. But when things get almost comically absurd, when the twists of identity and loyalty keep happening, you want to just say, walk away. Get a grip. Refuse to play, or maybe (at least) refuse to believe things like this are possible.

This is where Michael Douglas is perfect, and maybe does what few actors could pull off. Because as it gets insane, his character toughs it out. He's the type to take a challenge, to get extreme, to be risky, to protect his self-interests without surrender.

In some ways it's a great movie, so watch it as if it'll never let you go. And when it's just too much, be glad you went along for as long as you did. And enjoy the rest of the show for its theatrics. It remains really well made all through.",7
2 August 1998,As gripping as it gets.,"Whether you love it or hate it, The Game definitely will not bore you. By far the most engrossing movie I've ever watched. I saw this on the big screen and throughout most of this masterpiece I kept asking myself, ""where is this movie going?"" For 128 spirited minutes The Game takes your mind and twists it ruthlessly, contorting it in any way it so desires. Michael Douglas is the perfect actor for this role, he played it flawlessly. I love this movie, it's definitely one of my personal favorites.

12 January 2011,Fascinating,"Essentially, The Game is an interesting and fascinating film. While it is overlong, and lacking in credibility at the end, plus it is not Fincher's best film(Se7en) it does have a lot to like about it. As is the case with David Fincher, the film is visually stunning, with intriguing shots and camera angles and bold, stylish colours. Fincher's direction is ambitious and also very good, while the film's pace is brisk, the script is well crafted and the story is a great idea and is very gripping up until the ending. The acting is very good, Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as the increasingly desperate pawn and Sean Penn is equally impressive in a role that I actually think could have been bigger. All in all, it is a very good film, yes with its foibles but it is an intriguing idea constructed in an entertaining way. 8/10 Bethany Cox

18 November 2010,It's Completely Lacking In Credibility,"I like psychological suspense-thrillers. What makes them work really well is believability. No matter how outlandish the story may seem, there has to be at least a bit of your brain that's saying as you watch ""I could see that happening."" That's when you get drawn into the story. That's when suspense takes hold. That's when you begin to be able to feel the fear of the main characters. That's when a psychological suspense-thriller works really well. Unfortunately, ""The Game"" doesn't work really well. It doesn't do any of the above. It's simply not believable. Never once in the movie (or at least once we were introduced to the game that Nicholas Van Orten was playing) did I have the thought that ""I could see this happening."" Never. It was too outlandish. Think about it. In order for this game to work, pretty much the entire City of San Francisco would have had to have been onside. Van Orten could have done any number of things or (and here's the real problem) encountered any number of people who - not being in on the game - could have changed things completely. The game (to me at least) is unworkable; unplayable. Since that was my feeling right from the start, I didn't get pulled in by the story. I found it long and drawn out. The writers tried valiantly to keep me on my toes by throwing twists and turns and surprises - but I really didn't care, because I just didn't believe any of it. Too bad.

Too bad, because the cast was good and solid. Michael Douglas was in character, playing a fairly stereotypical character for him, as Nicholas Van Orten, and Sean Penn did well as his little brother Conrad, who presented Nicholas with the game as a birthday gift. I liked Deborah Unger as the ""waitress"" Christine. Honestly? She's attractive, but not the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, but she had a chemistry with Douglas, and she did present a real aura of sexiness, even though that wasn't particularly what the character was about (the ""I'm not wearing any underwear"" comment notwithstanding!)

The basic idea of a movie about a ""reality game"" (made in the era before ""reality TV"" became a staple) was interesting. If this had just been toned down a bit, and the scale of the game not been quite so large, it would have been more credible and therefore much more suspenseful and satisfying.",4
28 January 2007,An extremely underrated movie,"After the great success, both with critics and with the public, of ""Seven"", Director David Fincher turned to this film. It has often been said that this movie was one he'd wanted to make for a long time and upon viewing you can really see his belief in both characters and the story- overall an excellently directed movie.

Although several people argued that ""Seven"" was gory, in my opinion it wasn't, for example, there is a total lack of blood in the Lust scene, something which I particularly admired- the fact that a director could make a chilling and shocking movie without resorting to piling tons of blood onto the screen. Fincher continues this streak in ""The Game"" by drawing the tension and shocks of the film by using psychological terror.

Unfortunately, the movie could not parallel the success of ""seven"" upon its release and also received mixed critical reviews, however since then it has become somewhat of a cult movie with far more success on DVD than in the box office.

Perhaps most notable about the film is the fact that (apparently) Fincher himself often seems to direct his actors in a detached way, the way one might move around chess pieces in a game. Whether this is 100% true or not his direction, the acting and just about everything else is superb.",8
5 March 2001,An intelligent tale from start to finish.,"Let me just tell you that, as a middle aged film buff, I have seen my share of flicks, good and bad. Very few rate as high as ""The Game"" in entertainment value. ""The Game"" is most definitely one of the ""most fun"" movies to hit the silver screen in a long time. Filled with plot twists and turns, this film takes the movie-goer on a psychological roller coaster ride from the tile screens to the final credit roll.

""The Game"" is truly an intelligent tale, sort of a brain teaser that you get to watch and listen to, with a time limit. You have just 128 minutes to solve this, and chances are, like me, you'll be hanging on the solution to this puzzle until the very end.

The script was well written by a writer who clearly understands the needs of an adult audience. Yes, we like our fun but we like to exercise our brains once in a while also. And let there be no mistake about the great performances offered here by Michael Douglas and his co-stars. I was engrossed by all and couldn't take my eyes of the screen.

There is plenty for everybody here. Fun for all. A big winner in my book and definitely on my list of all time favorites. Get it and enjoy the ride!",9
24 December 2011,David Fincher's The Game gets another fine performance from star Michael Douglas,"Just watched this suspense thriller directed by David Fincher and starring Michael Douglas on HD DVD. Douglas is a broker in San Francisco who's about to have a birthday coming up. His brother Sean Penn gives him a present in the form of a possible membership in a company with the initials C.R.S. I'll stop there and just say that while things get unbelievably ridiculous, one gets curious anyway because of how one just wants see what they would do next. Fine supporting performances by Deborah Kara Unger as ""Christine"", Armin Mueller-Stahl, and James Rebhorn as someone connected with C.R.S. in more ways than one. Really, all I'll say now is I highly recommend The Game.

6 June 2021,One twist too many almost completely ruins an otherwise effective thriller.,"For its majority, 'The Game (1997)' is a well-made, compelling thriller. Fincher gives the film a great atmosphere and Douglas is excellent in the leading role. After a fairly slow but necessary set-up, the eponymous 'Game' begins and from there the thing is fast-moving and exciting. Sure, there are a few things that don't really make all that much sense and require a certain suspension of disbelief, but you sort of just go with it and it isn't really an issue for a long time. It's full of twists and turns, constantly keeping the audience as uncertain of the truth as our protagonist; this works for the most part. Frustratingly though, the film falls hard at the final hurdle. It has one twist too many, one that completely derails all that has come before. By including this final reveal, most of the film actually makes no sense - suspending disbelief isn't going to help you here. It asks you to accept that absolutely absurd things have been happening throughout the film in order to accept the ending, which actually makes a lot of what has come before seem rather comical. The protagonist also has such an out-of-character reaction to the reveal that it feels like some kind of dream sequence. It's a fantasy-like ending to a previously serious, mostly grounded thriller that leaves an absolutely sour taste in the mouth. Thankfully though, while you're on the ride it is entertaining and successfully thrilling, primarily thanks to Fincher's involvement. However, it does come to a highly unsatisfying screeching halt that makes you forget that it is actually well-done for 90% of its runtime. As a whole, it's unfortunately just shiny schlock. 6/10.",6

He doesn't take it seriously, though will later change his mind as it seems CRS is a sinister organization that puts his life in grave danger, as Nicholas is plunged into an ever-escalating series of events that threaten his life, and Conrad's... Frustrating film has some exciting scenes but ends up being, well, I won't give it away, but ask yourself how you would react if you were the target of this ""game"", and what your response would be!

11 September 2011,The Game is ON.,"I was hungry like anything when I started watching this movie and that was the only time I felt hungry. 2 hours and 3 minutes passed like you are playing your favorite GAME and could not concentrate anything else. If you think Micheal Douglas is an over rated actor then this movie is enough to prove you wrong. Sean Penn does full justice to his cameo. This is not a movie that leaves you with puzzles after watching unlike many mystery thrillers, instead it solves itself and relaxes your muscles after a rough ride. This is a movie with an engrossing script, excellent acting and flawless direction. If you have not watched this movie yet then PLAY it. You wont regret it all. Entertainment at its best. Now I can have my snacks and you go watch it. 8/10

26 September 2014,Functional gimmick expertly executed,"Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a lonely divorcée and extremely wealthy San Francisco investment banker. It's his 48th birthday which is the age of his father when he committed suicide in front of him. His absentee black sheep brother Conrad (Sean Penn) returns and gives him a card. What do you get for somebody who has everything? Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) which Conrad claims to be the best thing that ever happened to him. It's an unique game different for everybody. Jim Feingold (James Rebhorn) does the examination for CRS but Nicholas is rejected. Then he finds a dummy sprawled on his driveway with a CRS key and the game begins. Strange things start to happen. Waitress Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) spills on him and gets fired. They both get sucked into the CRS game.

This starts too slowly. There is a general lack of energy. The first 30 minutes almost lost me waiting for things to happen. It wants to be atmospheric. David Fincher is certainly good enough but I find myself not caring about Nicholas. He's a rich annoying douche with very little to like about him. It's an interesting if somewhat unoriginal gimmick. It would probably be better as a horror. I guess it would be helpful if I am naive enough to buy into the game. It would also be helpful to have a younger, sweeter, and more innocent actress to play Christine. The movie never escapes its manufactured sensibility. The point of most of this genre is to have Nicholas act paranoid and for the audience to question his sanity. His sanity is never in doubt in the mind of the audience. It's just one insane thing happening to him after another. And the cops would never say it's OK to murder him as long as Nicholas signed the contract. It's kinda stupid but the movie asks the audience to buy into it. It's so well made that I'm fine with how crazy this game gets. However it does go one too many turn. It would have been much better to leave with a sad ending.",5
10 March 2000,"A movie that looks good on the surface, but has a totally contrived ending that is shameful to the viewer.","""The Game"" was highly recommended to me. I watched it, found myself caught up in the action and plot twists. Then, at the end, the movie literally insults the intelligence of the viewer with its contrived ending. You end up feeling cheated for the time you spent watching it, plus, you have absolutely no feelings about the characters. I gave it a ""4"", being generous, but I certainly can't recommend this for any mature viewer. Maybe teenagers!

20 August 1999,Justifiable Homicide,"I watched this film with amazement throughout the whole thing. Excuse me, but who did the filmmakers market this to? I can say that if I had a relative of mine do to me what Sean Penn did to Michael Douglas in this movie, when I went on trial for their death I can't see how I wouldn't be found as justifiable homicide. This movie was ridiculous and stupid throughout, and the whole idea of Douglas picking up the female lead after everything she helped put him through, what a farce!

3 March 2022,The ending..,"I would have given it an 8 but that ending is one of cringest thing i ever seen. The movie is thrilling and becomes interesting. But it takes everything for granted. What kinda mega multimilionary agency takes to remove every single trace by the police or secret agency of a millionaire man? And the ending.. they almost killed him multiple times predicting to actually make him stay alive until the end. There's one thing that can't be predicted and that's someone death: what if he shot himself in the head?

17 May 2015,"Intriguing, but flawed, thriller","Intriguing, but flawed, thriller.

The Game relies heavily on a clever plot, and for you to suspend disbelief. The clever plot is maybe too clever for its own good, creating plot holes. Eventually, after the umpteenth twist the whole thing just feels implausible.

This said, it is quite entertaining - a roller-coaster ride of a movie. Very original too.

Solid performance from Michael Douglas in the lead role, in a role that suits him best (ie crime thriller). Good support from Deborah Kara Unger and Sean Penn.

30 November 2018,Fincher sets the tone,"David Fincher shows early signs of his mastery of the thriller genre with this film. The tone throughout the film really creates a great atmosphere and helps keep the mystery interesting. The ending doesn't feel quite as impactful or jaw-dropping as I would have hoped for given the terrific build up to it, but it still is pretty satisfying.

5 August 1999,A game? I prefer Monopoly...,"All through the movie we have the ""edge of the seat"" suspense of ""is this for real or part of the game?"". The movie gets more and more wild and less and less believable that it made me lose interest and just wait for it to over. The climax was even worse and made me roll my eyes over and over again 'till I got dizzy.

A game? Ok, a boring stupid game.

26 September 2022,Let the game begin,"Another film I've been meaning to get around to for ages, The Game concerns itself with high profile banker Nicholas who receives an odd birthday present from his brother - an invitation to play a mysterious game that is guaranteed to inject some excitement into your life. Intrigue gets the better of him and the game begins... and as the stakes increase and the life of him and his family become threatened, the lines between the game and reality become increasingly blurry.

I'm a big fan of Fincher's work, and this is one of his very best. The performances are great, the twisting and turning plot keeps you guessing and the film takes you on a crazy journey with a twist I genuinely did not see coming. Just as you think you've got it, in comes another curveball. Essential viewing.

The only thing that was interesting in the ending was - is the game really over? Did Nicholas fall into another rabbit hole with Christine or is the same game continue off screen? The music at the tail end of the film will leave you wondering.

Overall, I really enjoyed the film - just wish there was a bit more to the ending.

8/10.

18 February 2016,The Game was No Laughing Matter,"Yesterday I watched a movie that I hadn't seen in 19 years so I decided to watch another movie that I hadn't seen in about as long. Whereas the other movie was worse than I remembered, ""The Game"" was better than I remembered.

Before the morbid movie ""Saw"" put chosen people through an orchestrated ""game"" of sorts there was ""The Game"". Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker out of San Francisco. He's arrogant, rude and cutthroat--many of the qualities needed to be a successful businessman--but he's also lonely. On his 48th birthday his brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), gave him a gift of a ""game"" set up by CRS (Consumer Recreation Services). The ""game"" was no game at all to Nicholas, it was real.

I liked the fact they made Nicholas realistic. In other words, he wasn't a raging a-hole. They didn't make his character so over the top that you thoroughly hated him. He was a businessman that had standards. He wanted things done a certain way and he expected them done the way he wanted. He never made a scene to humiliate anyone or belittle anyone. He was subtle but his point was made. In that sense we weren't set up for some major conversion ala Scrooge.

The game he got involved in was elaborate. Maybe that would be the only real knock against the movie: just how elaborate the game was. It involved dozens of participants, series of misdirection and even some near death moments. It was so elaborate it bordered on extreme.

Besides that nuance I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed it today just like I did, ahem... years ago.",8
28 August 2022,I wish I could watch it again for the first time. Remarkable film!,"Where do I begin? I don't want to make this too long, I just want to get to the point - that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and ironically, just as one of the characters in the film says, ""I wish I could experience it all again for the first time"".

Not only is the cast fantastic, and immaculate in their acting in this film, but the directing and cinematography is absolutely outstanding, on top of, of course, the incredible storytelling in this film. I honestly can't decide what takes the cake! But let me tell you this, this film will leave you on the edge of your seat and keep you guessing up until the ending of the film where the credits begin to play - no I'm not joking!

Don't ""think"" about watching this film, take it from me, and WATCH IT!

21 July 2006,Surface-smart (with shallow results),"Michael Douglas plays steely-cold investment banker in San Francisco who gets a curious birthday gift from his ne'er-do-well brother: membership in a mysterious club which promises to enrich Douglas' existence. At first, the pranks are elaborate but silly, but eventually the icy businessman encounters blackmail, entrapment, attempts on his life, and finds himself quickly losing his cool. The film, stylish yet limited, only works if you accept Douglas' reactions--but I didn't believe it for a minute when he freaks out in a public place because his briefcase won't open. There are not so many 'errors' in the film as outright implausibilities, and Michael Douglas as an actor finds himself in quicksand, occasionally looking just as ridiculous as the plot. Director David Fincher is becoming rather predictable: once again, he gets the proceedings off to a sluggish start (with stilted introductions to his players) and doesn't follow through on promising ideas or with basic logic (as when Douglas finally calls the police about a break-in, yet the scene is left unresolved). The picture is frustrating, but not in the suspenseful sense. It should've been smarter. ** from ****",5
24 August 2011,A Well-Made Film!,"'The Game', directed by the legendary David Fincher, is A Well-Made Film, that grabs your attention, thanks to it's terrific story-line, that is innovative, escapist & yet, arresting. The only glitch, comes in it's culmination, which left me in mixed emotions.

'The Game' tells the story of an investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.

'The Game' begins fabulously and grabs your attention from the very start. The Writing, in the first-hour, especially, is so engrossing & captivating, that it hardly gives you a chance to move your eyes from the Screen. The second-hour is interesting as well, but I thought the culmination, was plain average. The Screenplay by John Brancato & Michael Ferris is very good, but they definitely could've come up with a better end.

David Fincher directs this Psychological thriller, remarkably. His work, in each and every scene, is praise-worthy. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is sharp. Art Design is passable.

Performance-Wise: Michael Douglas pitches in an incredible performance. The Highly-Talented Actor plays the participant, with utmost conviction & understanding. Sean Penn is excellent as his brother. Deborah Kara Unger is decent. James Rebhorn & Armin Mueller-Stahl lend good support.

On the whole, An Interesting Watch, that to a large-extend, stands out.",7
30 July 2001,"Just when you got the plot, it turns upon you","This has to be one of the more interesting psychological thrillers made recently. Just when you think you got ahold of the plot it changes! Playing with ""the implicit viewer"" this movie has a tendency to constantly surprise and redefine itself in relation to the ""expectancy horizon"". What a wonderful positive redefinition of ""Seven"", culminating in a refinement of the human nature and at the same time leaving the viewer with a subtle taste of the ""rosicrucian initiation"" in the mouth.

Definitly worth a view!

15 April 2002,Oh Brother!,"I don't make it a habit of commenting on films I entirely dislike. It's too easy to knock a film, especially since--unlike myself--most professional film critics haven't made very many films themselves. Fincher is good, but this is not his best. 'The Game' being played here is between two brothers, one who's already learned his lesson in life, and one who will soon likewise mend his ways. Morality tales have been far better than this. Without giving away too much, what would've happened if the Michael Douglas character had missed the air mattress? There aren't any sure-fire safety features you can back this one with, no matter how much you suspend your disbelief. The Game just went too far, for too long.

29 January 2009,My favorite movie of all times and not for the obvious reasons.,"I first saw this on VHS tape when it first came out. It was not in theaters long enough for word of mouth to drive a wave of references. This was the only movie I ever had to immediately rewind, gather the family and watch it again that night. Do not watch on TV where it is has been cut for time. What I liked about this film is that every frame and every scene was important to the story. There are no puppy in the window filler shots. I applaud the writing and the directing for such an intricate weaving of ""The Game"" concept. Not a film for those with no patience or interest in covert operations. I now enjoy watching others watch this film as they start to recognize things and try to figure out what is going on, only to be wrong several times. I see something new every time I watch it. Brilliant concept and execution of the concept on film.

5 June 2004,Very original,"THE GAME is very entertaining and especially original.

David Fincher directed very well this story and made it really credible. Okay, sometimes there are some open questions but if you ignore all that it works. The story never gets boring and Michael Douglas delivers after his psycho-movie FALLING DOWN another masterpiece. THE GAME is another psycho thriller where Michael Douglas is a business man being involved in a very dangerous game with a surprisingly end. It´s like a hot trip through an adventure and a nightmare. I can highly recommend it to every cinema fan and I watched it already the third time on DVD with my wife.

THE GAME gets a place in my best of DVD collection. Our Rating: 7.5 / 10 that matches exactly the actual vote of 7.5.

9 May 2004,"Great, but could have been better","David Fincher is almost always reliable to deliver some good thrills. Se7en is probably the best thriller I've ever seen, Panic Room is pretty exciting and I've heard a lot of good things about Fight Club. However, this one stands out, at least from Panic Room and Se7en, since pretty much nothing in this movie is what it seems. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the action scenes, and it keeps you wondering, up until the very last minute, what the hell is going on. Then you find out. I'm not saying the ending was downright bad, but it could definitely have used some improvement. It could have been worse, but it could also have been so much better. The end just seems to ruin a lot of the buildup of the rest of the film. Anyway, the plot is very good, a man who has everything, but isn't completely satisfied with his life, gets a chance to have some ""fun"". He takes it, and his life is changed forever. The acting is all good. The characters are well-written and credible. Actually, everything but the ending is top notch. The ending is the one reason that this movie doesn't get, at least, a 9. It just ruins so much of the movie, especially because the moment the definite end of the movie is reached, it feels empty. Up until that moment, you feel like you were watching a work of art, and then just before it ends in the same way that the rest of it has been, it cuts to some lame excuse for everything that happened in the movie up to that point, rather than a good explanation. I really wish they had made the ending better. Overall, a pretty good thriller, that could have been a masterpiece. I recommend this to fans of Fincher's other work, and fans of psychological thrillers altogether. 8/10",8
14 September 2022,25 years and going strong,"This film came to mind tonight as one I'd not watched in a while, apparently it just turned 25 years but still is s great cinematic ride, sure to leave you with chills.

Beyond the story, i really caught all the jokes in the movie tonight, there some great one liners that are here, despite the gripping nature of the film yet it doesn't take away from the experience.

The only reason i have it 9 not 10 is that much of the film is on dark locations and shot at night. Just a little too dark for my liking...

Just watch it! You'll be contemplating your life and the value of people for hours after.

13 July 2012,You Won...But You Cheated,"This is a very hard movie to like. It is so manipulative that it's hard to suspend disbelief. After it is over you feel that your opponent has won the game, but had to cheat to do it.

It is played out in a back and forth ""game"" of...they are playing with me and now they are playing against me...no wait, they have played the game and its over and we just don't know it...no wait, maybe...it all just gets to be overwhelming.

It is too clever for its own good and has a few too many plot twists to sustain and it all comes down to an overloaded, bloated, confusing letdown.

8 January 2002,Terrible!,"There are two reactions to this movie - People like it or hate it. Put me in the second camp. Whether it was ""The Freshman"" or ""The Truman Show,"" you've seen this bad, bad movie before. It's the wish fulfillment of the arrogant. It goes something like this in ""the Game:"" You may be an a**hole but you're such an important a**hole that everyone in your life (even Daniel Shor) is playacting just for your benefit, just to guide you to a lesson. It still flatters self-important d**kheads into thinking that people in their lives are pawns manipulated for their benefit.

Regardless of continual trick endings, you've already suspected the whole thing is a ruse, because if it's not, it's a pretty standard and boring conspiracy thriller. The movie has a few funny moments early on then it becomes mysterious, then it become more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then more mysterious, then... Get the picture? Did you really want me to say ""more mysterious"" again? No! Because part of the fun of a mystery is being allowed to play along. Providing developments instead of underlining the mystery again and again. ""Contact"" did this beautifully. Although it eventually gets nowhere, every fifteen minutes or so you're allowed to see a little more of a full picture. Here, the mystery just deepens without any actual developments. Wasn't anyone in a preview shouting, ""Yes, David WE GET IT!""? It gets so tedious that I actually skipped three or four chapters onthe DVD. I just didn't care. It reminded me of ""Total Recall"" and ""Sleuth."" 2 other movies that wear you out with pointless plot-twists and reversals.

Hollywood airheads think they recognize this as an idea film. ""The Game"" remains a game to no matter to what absurd scale it grows, even though there is no way you could even anticipate the random causes and effects in a single day of your life. Free will is completely erased in this movie. That's just how smart the controllers of the game are. Sadly David Fincher isn't that smart and there are plot-holes you could throw talentless scriptwriters through. How did they know where he'd jump off the building? Don't ask such silly questions! Surface effects are much more important than credibility. And that final ""wow' ending (Think of this movie as a really long tedious sermon) matters more than any internal logic. As idea films go, this one tugs - If rich pompous businessmen require a ruse this elaborate and expensive, who would actually care about them?

Finchers ideas are really lame. I can now add this to the list of very bad Fincher movies. Seven, Alien 3, and it's so bad that it even makes me reconsider Fight Club and it's lame ending.

The people I know who like this movie are self-important blowhards most in need of a lesson like this. I knew enough to suspect their raves. I would jam this baby into my top five worst movies of all time list.",1

23 April 2023,ONE OF THE BEST 90's Films! A masterpiece!,"VERY CLEVERLY MADE!

SHOULD HAVE WON AN OSCAR!

AN INTELLIGENT MASTERPIECE!

EMBRACES MYSTERY! A great psychological thriller!

Its one of the few films that you could not guess the ending! Perfect!

This film gives me ""Shutter island (2010)"", ""Triangle of sadness (2022) and ""Escape room (2019)"", ""Sherlock (2010-2017"" and ""The net (1995)"" vibes. It has really inspired many other great films!

A thriller on the edge! Its a deep psychological play, where you dont know who is telling the truth and who is lying.

And aswell society's great ability when it cooperates towards the same goal, whether good or bad.

Very fantastic plot twist that makes you wonder is all this part of the game?

What is real and whats not?

It explores our free choice and it displays that everything has consequences.

It includes exploring moral and ethical rules, as society may be showing another reality to you, then you are aware of.

Fantastic acting and beautiful filming! This is a movie made to think about society itself and its values, egoism and when the limit to one's private freedom is narrowed and you are instead constantly monitored. Willingly or not?

While it also exploring the classes of society, which is unusual for an American film. Its a parody of the richest in the society. Class Critical where this event shows the protagonist the true reality and gives him a thought about how he should behave in the future.

FANTASTIC MANUSCRIPT AND PERFECT MUSIC!

Great ending! It will shock you! WOW!

I really recommend it! WATCH IT!",10
2 November 2007,One of the best films of 1997. Mind thrilling with fun entertainment and suspense!,"Of all the films I saw in the year 1997, this ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas has to be one of the best. Because really you don't see any complex plot twist, and the the film is thrilling and suspenseful with a hard and direct pressed acting performance from Douglas. I really too liked the story and thrilling mood from director David Fincher. You have Michael Douglas as millionaire businessman financier Nicholas Van Orton who's very successful yet he's lonely and carries a very uptight personality while living in his San Francisco mansion. So one day younger brother the more liberal and free spirited Conrad(Sean Penn) gives Nicholas a birthday present a gift card from a corporate company called consumer recreation services(CRS) for as Conrad says the experience and pleasure of a lifetime that this game will add all the fun and entertainment to your life that's missing. So Nicholas tries the service out, and one by one his life starts to get creepy, unpredictable, and very strange in very unusual ways. Many of the moments and scenes are memorable from his talking TV developing it's own voice, the clown left in front of his home entrance, to his meeting of a sexy blonde waitress Christine(Deborah Kara Unger)and most of all his taxi cab one night takes a plunge off the golden gate bridge! This nonsense starts to drive him crazy as the worry starts to make him wonder if he will end up like his father and meet a tragic end the past haunts him so much. Only to find out how it ends is strange and simple it really surprises the viewer the first time they watch. Overall really a fine done film with good acting from Douglas and the story was a neat concept from Fincher with thrills and fun suspense and in it's day this film might have been a glimpse into the future form of identity theft. Anyway ""The Game"" still entertains and it's clearly one of 1997's best.",8
8 June 2006,Are you ready to play?,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",9
16 October 2008,Outstanding flick,"Like many of the prior comments here, I found this film engrossing and interesting, in terms of its presenting more intelligent fare than most of the offerings today, on large screen or small. Having recently seen it again, it is also a flick which is one of those as interesting on subsequent viewings as the first.

And aside from the excellent cast and performances, and with Michael Douglas, my personal favorite actor -- it managed to combine several genres at once, all of them better-presented than in films where only one would be involved.

Science fiction has always presented unexplainable and impossible features compared with ""real life."" Heck, 70 years ago, Buster Crabbe as ""Buck Rogers,"" along with his cohorts, was flying throughout the universe in a craft, large and well-equipped and -furnished, much like Kirk and Spock and the ""Star Wars"" denizens, everyone walking around freely as if they were in a fancy hotel suite. Yet even today, the ships and space stations remain cramped and less-than commodious.

Along with ""science fiction'"" (and containing many occurrences patently impossible, but somehow credible), this film also has characteristic of the horror genre, ""Poltergeist-""type occurrences; also the good old-fashion ""noir"" flick of the 40's and 50's (the reason why Brian Donlevey died with a healthy estate). It also has pure mystery elements, along with those of sophisticated drama, the ""main character (however powerful and rich)"" reordering his priorities and finding what's really important in life. It also provided some ""road film"" scenes, and plenty of danger for the lead character.

There probably are a few other categories, but these are sufficient to describe this outstanding picture, well-crafted, interesting, and one of those few capable of holding your interest throughout.",10
16 July 2022,Peak Michael Douglas,"The most important thing in this film is in my opinion it's meaning. You might be rich and have a luxurious lifestyle, you might be able to buy and do basically anything, but will you?

Michael Douglas delivered a fantastic performance as an average boring businessman, whose life took a big turn and transformed from boring to a complete thriller. We all were probably a bit confused at the end when we realized what had happened. Personally I didn't expect that at all, and I think that's a great thing.

No doubt a great film with a great meaning. One of Fincher's classics. Happy I watched this.

12 April 2011,Full of surprises,"""The Game"" is about a wealthy investment banker, called Nicholas Van Orton, who is given a mysterious birthday present by his brother Conrad. When he participates in this game, unusual events happen that interfere with his daily routine, endangering his life. The closer he gets to figuring out the master behind the game, the more dangerous the events get, making him become closer to death. He must risk everything he has to discover the deadly secret.

The director, David Fincher, creates this film in a great way. The earlier success of his previous film ""Seven"" gave the producers of ""The Game"" an opportunity to acquire a higher profit. The film was eventually ranked #44 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.

This thriller successfully holds suspense the whole way through. The incidents displayed throughout the film are shown in a sequence that continually makes us wonder what is happening, and the rapid change in events keeps us watching. There is a wide range of occurrences happening throughout the movie, which only make sense at the end of the story, so once we have seen a few of the experiences that Nicholas must go through, we are dragged into the film, continually wondering who is good, who is bad, and how the events all link together.

I recommend this film to anyone who likes mystery story's, thrills and suspense. It is fantastically structured, and it is a must see for anyone who likes films in this genre.

8/10 - ""The Game"" is full of surprises and should not be missed!",8
19 November 2020,Rare movie,"Absolute masterpiece. Such an emotional roller coaster, the acting was sublime to such a point where i felt the one being taken advantage of, not at one point where i thought the game ended even at the end of movie, thats how great this movie is.

21 March 2014,I'm 17 years late and I don't regret it,"""The Game"" came out when I was 10 years old, which was my primary obstacle in terms of seeing it sooner than now. The movie gained popularity, and I admit that I should made greater efforts to see it. However, with new movies being released every other week, it is hard to keep track of a movie wish-list. This week, I checked the top-rated films on IMDb and ""The Game"" came up. After watching it, my response is ""better late than never!"" Watching this movie was worth the 17 year wait! There is nothing cheap and desperate about this movie. ""The Game"" is simply a display of high quality cinematography! I am not a film student and have no history or interest in the ""art"" of movie-making. Yet I can recognize great acting, good story-lines, and sufficiently thrilling scenes. To potential viewers, my advice is to remember that I recommended The Game to you! I look forward to the good karma from imparting beneficial advice!

26 July 1999,"Silly, stupid and predictable","This is one of the few comments I decided to write after reading other peoples. Anyone who watched this film and thought the ending was a surprise or twist, my god you couldn't handle the Teletubies.

The film started off ok, but about half way through I realised that things were getting silly and started not to care about the main character at all. In the end it was obvious what was going to happen, but the ridiculous idea that someone could have planned and anticipated every action that someone might take was beyond absurd to say the least.

Then of course we can just fall through a window and be perfectly ok.

I don't want to sound too rude, the film wasn't that bad, but to claim that it was clever and has a shock ending, is ridiculous. The film was silly, unbelievable and very predictable.",1

16 April 2021,Definitely an interesting one,"Saw this on Netflix and I was fished in by the premise of this film and overall I have to say that I did enjoy it.

What the film did really well was keep you entertained and interested in the story and the reason why that's the more important than usual is, because you have absolutely no idea what direction the film is heading and how it's going to end. Which is incredibly smart as it's mirroring what Michael Douglas' character is also experiencing. But yeah, for a 2hr 10 film it kept the suspense incredibly well from minute one and I was entertained and interested throughout!

The plot itself is very different to what you normally see, but it isn't complicated in anyway. Even though you don't know what direction the film is heading you aren't confused at any stage. So bravo from that front.

I do have a couple of issues with the film that I want to mention.

Michael Douglas' character is extremely unlikeable throughout, to everyone and anyone he's a proper *insert word of your choice* and comes off very obnoxious. I understand why the character is done that way, but considering the film is basically just him it's very annoying to watch.

The ending. I want to say that this isn't a bad ending at all and all the questions you want answering, get answered. However, I found it a tad underwhelming. When a film like this is done, it all hinges on one moment where everything clicks together. So when the ""twist"" happens and the ending comes along I just found the whole thing a bit under done. I'm trying not to give spoilers, but I found everything to be insanely implausible and I couldn't get past it.

Overall though, it's a very good thriller still and definitely worthy of a watch if you haven't done so already.",7
15 November 1998,An interesting concept ruined by several improbabilities.,"It was totally unbelievable that: 1. A network commentator (played by Dan Schorr)could be duplicated to say dialoge on demand. 2. The Michael Douglas character could be left trapped in a taxi and launched underwater with the expectation that he wouldn't be seriously injured or killed. 3. That his character could be expected to impulsively leap from a tall building in a suicide attempt and not be injured or killed. One knows the planning it takes for a professional stunt man to do this.

31 August 2022,Loved it!,"This is the sort of film that appeals to me a great deal. The plot reminds me a bit of Shutter Island - the subjects of these movies are completely different, but the similarity is that they twist and turn, and repeatedly turn the world on its head, to keep you guessing and make you doubt what in the movie is real. This film seemed to promise that from the description.

And my goodness, did it deliver. I watched it in two chunks, and had to try REALLY hard not to look up what was coming next. It was massively gripping and kept me wanting to watch to find out what was happening.

Michael Douglas does put in a solid performance here. He convincingly carries off the cold, and always-in-control lead character. You can see that he is very used to getting his own way, very used to being in control and in environments he is comfortable in, and how he gradually starts to lose his cool as he finds that control being taken away with nothing he can do about it. Later on, as he is reduced to a very pitiful state, and again it's carried off well, as a man coming to terms with what he has lost.

The ending has apparently gotten some stick, but I actually enjoyed it. I must admit, I didn't guess it at all. Quite often these sorts of movies seem to end either badly, or in a sort of ""it was all a dream"" kind of way, but this one took its own route. I thought it pulled it off well, and it kept me guessing!

My only real gripes were that there is a backstory about the lead character's father, but it's hardly explored and mostly mentioned but then discarded again. I'm not sure it added much. Also, as well as Michael Douglas, pretty much everyone in this gave a really good performance. I just felt that Sean Penn was a bit wasted. He turned in a good show as well but was hardly in it.

If mysteries/conspiracies are your thing and you don't like predictability, this should definitely be your thing.",9

19 May 2016,"Classic psychological underrated mystery thriller, Michael Douglas best!","A classic mystery thriller the best of Michael Douglas he ever made with David Fincher I love this film to death! It is my third favorite Michael Douglas film. This is my Favorite David Fincher Flick. The first time I saw it I fall in love with it and I kept watching it, since my teen years it is my favorite Michael Douglas film. The Game (1997) is a terrific mystery thriller and it is David Fincher's third feature film and very underrated among st his work. This is a thrilling mystery, that keeps guessing you if it is everything real or just a fiction. David Fincher and Michael Douglas did a terrific and outstanding job. I remember seeing an VHS in the bookstore on a sell page, I wish I would bought this film on VHS than, but lucky I have it on Blu-ray disc. This was a hit in 1997 back than when the movie come out. I even have a co worker who went to see this film in a movie theater. I am going to say it again I love this film to death and I love Michael Douglas!

""I'm being toyed with by a bunch of depraved children...""

Plot: Wealthy San Francisco financier Nicholas Van Orton gets a strange birthday present from wayward brother Conrad: a live-action game that consumes his life.

THERE ARE NO RULES IN THE GAME. And that will make life very difficult for Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas). a successful businessman who is always in control. Van Orton lives a well-ordered life - until an unexpected birthday gift from his brother (Sean Penn) destroys it all. Van Orton has been enrolled in a game - ""a profound life experience"" - that begins quietly enough but soon erupts in a rush of devastating and bizarre events. Like it or not, he must either win the game or lose control of everything in his life.

The movie is a mystery about a game from a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) it is a game like a vacation for holidays, just the vacation comes to you. This is a birthday gift from Connie (Sean Penn) to his brother Nicholas (Michael Douglas). When the game starts you keep thinking this is for real and people are really trying to kill Nicholas to get his money. First they screwed up his brother and now they want to screw him over.

This is very, very well directed thriller and Michael Douglas best performance ever. I found the ending to be brilliant and makes sense. Deborah Kara Unger was extremely gorgeous and very hot sexy babe! I was even in love with her after seeing her in this movie. The scene in which protagonist Van Orton finds a life-size clown doll in his driveway was ranked #44 on Bravo's list of The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.

For a David Fincher fan like myself, there are movies that I actually like they are: Se7en, Zodiac and of course Panic Room (2002) this was the film I went to see it in the movie theater in June 2002, when it was by us released in Slovenia it was actually the first Jodie Foster film I saw in a movie theater. But The Game will always be my favorite David Fincher film and Michael Douglas's third favorite film. I also do think this movie is very underrated and some people don't like it. Well I don't like Fight Club and I am probably the only one , but The Game I love to death. I heard years ago that Michael Douglas had a fun making this film with David Fincher and he would love to do another thriller with Fincher again, if Fincher would offer him another movie role.

My favorite scene in the film is with the taxi cab when the taxi driver leaves him alone the car and the car drives on the pier in the water and Nicholas open's the window with that hook he received for the game package. I love when operatives of CRS are using suppressed Heckler & Koch MP5K's automatic machine gun to shoot the apartment of Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) and opens fire on Nicholas. Nicholas leaps off the skyscraper and crashes through a glass ceiling, but he lands safely in an airbag. There he finds his family and friends awaiting his arrival and The Game is revealed to have just been a game. The accounts have not been drained, the gun was replaced with one firing blanks, and his brother is alive.

I am giving this film a perfect 10 out of 10 which I do believe is a classic David Fincher's underrated psychological best mystery thriller. Mine favorite Michael Douglas film of all time I love it!

The Game is a 1997 American mystery thriller film directed by David Fincher, starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, and produced by Propaganda Films and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It tells the story of a wealthy investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his everyday life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.

26 October 2008,Hollywoood-style entertainment at its best,"Nicholas Van Orten is a billionaire who has forgotten how to enjoy himself, and how to connect with anyone else. An ex-wife with whom he has little or no contact, a younger prodigal brother, and memories of a father who took his own life are the only human points of contact in his orbit. Pretty poor fare, and his plight is hardly going to top anyone's sympathy list.

Fincher gives the whole thing high production values and a sinister sheen, adding pace and intrigue throughout. He makes excellent use of shadows and light, casting Van Orton's home is a particularly frosty hue. The story moves along briskly and economically, Van Orten fighting to retain control (his biggest fear being to lose control) of a situation that escalates rapidly in a series of adrenaline rushes. The sleek cars, expensive suits and chrome office buildings give way to Mexican dirt and dust and a bus ride with chickens. And that is the game just starting.

Michael Douglas may lack range, but he can match any actor alive in the sneering stakes. Sean Penn is a nice counterpoint, rash and unruly but somehow charming with it.

This isn't a film with a message (except for the inevitable thinly-disguised morality tale element Hollywood so often insists on), and you probably won't watch it twice. But for slick, high paced entertainment that keeps you guessing till the end, this is a great one-off film.",8

30 December 2011,The Lame,"A fabulously rich investment manager signs up for a mysterious activity known as ""The Game,"" which completely disrupts his life. It gets off to an intriguing start, as the anticipation builds for the game. Then the game begins and weird things start happening to Douglas that make no sense outside of sci-fi/fantasy realm. Yet, one watches with some interest expecting everything to be sorted out at some point, a point that never really comes. When the inevitable twist is revealed, one is left bewildered because it invalidates pretty much everything that has happened in the movie. This unbelievably stupid movie doesn't just call for suspension of disbelief, but also suspension of intelligence.

18 April 2021,Ridiculously far fetched,"This is well made movie and well acted but is based on a totally idiotic and unrealistic storyline. There are moments (to avoid spoilers I will just say the taxi, the end scene) which are just plain silly and ruin what could have been a decent enough thriller. If you must watch it leave you brain behind before you start.

26 March 1999,"A cinematic abomination, shamelessly manipulative","The worst aspect of this film is how the creators don't care to follow through on their convictions. They are clearly nihilistic. Instead of showing this, they play on the desire of the audience members for something coherent. I left the theater (and my viewing of snippets when I run across it in channel surfing) with a feeling of physical violation, of having had depraved intellects smeared across my brain.

Too harsh? I don't think so. One is expected to empathize with Michael Douglas's character, in trying to understand that all of his arbitrary injuries are in fact aspects of an incredibly complex practical joke. (No, I'm not going to dignify it with the noun ""game."") Yet one is expected, simultaneously, to believe that some malign organization is genuinely trying to destroy him.

The problem with this tension is that if Douglas's free will is ever asserted, the plot (such as it is) instantly collapses. He can't be too smart. He can't think outside a limited set of boxes. He can't match up facts in any way that shows insight -- or else the joke-makers will not be successful in anticipating what he is doing. In short, the story depends on Douglas's character being precisely as vapid as everybody expects of him at his worst, and that he won't give up until they think it best for him to give up.

If Douglas, here, believes the premise of a malign power, he would be more likely to slip up -- with a deadly result for himself or someone else -- out of sheer overconcentration on his situation. Too much stress, y'know? You aren't at your most perceptive. Especially with a gun in your pocket. The plot counts upon his virtues, as dullard as they are, while at the same time undercutting all of them.

The final twist involves the apparent death of someone truly close to him, at his own hand. Yet did it happen? And is such a shock something to be used to deprive -any- human being of personal dignity? So much so that, shortly afterwards, he's expected to recover and be mindlessly festive? I found this to be an instance of psychological torture. If I wanted this, I'd watch the war in Yugoslavia, and CNN has nearly zero marginal cost.

That brilliant cinematography, adept character acting (on occasion), and Douglas's dogged persistence are used all create no excuse for such incoherent manipulation. All we have is a canker on the human spirit.

This is a nihilistic cesspool. Don't waste your money, not even on a 99-cent bargain rental night. If you possess any human sensibilities, you'll berate yourself later... when it isn't giving you nightmares.",1

14 February 2002,An insult to the intelligence,"This movie was made not long after the movies ""The usual suspects"" and ""seven"" were made. Both of them had what is called a ""surprise ending"". I'd bet a year salary that ,after seeing the success of those films, some greedy producer told his stuff ""I want you to make me this kind of a movie!!"" so the writer first thoght of a surprising end and then had built a movie around it, I don't buy for a second all the other analysis of the movie about ""inner layers"" or some other crap. This movie was meant to make some money by having a surprise ending and that is all. Well, don't get me wrong I love those kind of movies but I hate when I'm presented with something so illogical and insulting to the intelligence. let me explain why: No one is that smart period. no one can predict what someone is gonna do so accurately, it is IMPOSSIBLE. Imagine a crime scene filled with potential clues, it might take a lot of time figuring out the relevant clues and figuring out who is the killer. Now suppose you know exactly who did it and why, so now (suppose you want to look smart) you know exactly what clues are relevant and how to build the chain of evidence that will lead you to the cuLprit. do that and all the other detectives will think you're the smartest man in the world - It is very easy to know what to do in retrospect. and that is exactly the error of the movie - the writer knew the ending and builT the entire movie around it ,because he knew the answer it is easy to reconstruct the questions! so it easy for him to forsee the hero's actions. but ,as I said, No one is smart enough in real life. You think that someone might be? well. for example, there is a famous problem in physics called the 3 body problem: you have 3 bodies revolving around each other and you have to know (knowing the start \ point) their position after an arbitrary time. the equations governing their movement aren't very complicated but even the most powerful supercomputers cannot do that in a reasonable time. only 3 bodies!!!

And in the movie we have much much much more complicated thing -real people, the real world etc. so You're gonna tell me that a small group of actors can predict all what the hero would do in such accuracy? don't make me laugh.

As i said this movie was made to make money by having a surprise ending and It has done so and let all laws of logic be gone to hell.

this movie was awful and an utter insult to the intelligence of anyone with I.Q over 60.",1

18 February 2008,Well what else would expect from the man who gave us Fight Club and Se7en?,"I really had not the slightest clue what I purchased when I bought myself a copy of the game. From the trailer the film looked like it was worth a look and it seemed as if I was also invented to go along for the ride when I picked it up. I would rather not discuss the plot with anyone because this movie is definitely an experience which some could argue come close to what the late Alferd Hitchcock would bring to us , all I can say that after watching you might love it loathe one thing is for certain and that is that won't ever be bored during the course of this journey. As good as Sean Penn is , this was without a shout of a doubt Micheal Douglas's movie , from the begin he just lures you in with his unique form of acting to the point where one actually begins to sympathises with him. There are classic Dave Fincher trademarks whether it be deliberately keeping things dark with plenty of twists and turns and not to mention a tight script. My only complaint was that the movie might just drag a little in places but having said that it never wonders far at all and the action and suspense is great. To conclude I had no idea what this movie would be like when I viewed it last night and I guess that was the trick of it all as we take the ride with Mr Van Orton ! Highly recommended to movie lovers all over the world and make sure this is on your '100 movies to watch before I Die' list ! I promise you that it is an experience as Dave Fincher will play you like a piano and you won't even notice !

25 February 2002,leave your I.Q. at the door.,"If you thought this movie was suspenseful with a plausible plot and ending then you must have really enjoyed paying $6.00 for about 80 cents worth of movie popcorn.

It had to be a real stretch for Douglas to play an uptight business man...I'm guessing he researched the role by watching his last 10 movies. The lemon-twist ending was straight from Hollywood 101 and was probably recycled from a poorly written Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode. If you want to watch a movie with a putz going from one possibly controlled environment to the next then watch ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"". It is just as bad as ""The Game"" but at least it had Bill Murray.

25 September 2019,I gave it one star just for trying,"I don't want to give anything away since it isn't fair to those who haven't seen the film. However, all in all it's a waste of time, energy money talent. However will comment on the script it's a dud that appears to be very clever, but it's a dud acting - well Michael Douglas isn't an. actor's actor because he always plays the same part - you know - that great comment - we need someone whose like Michael Douglas - you know - gritty, nasty, unhappy, full of himself, not really interesting but sells enough tickets at the box office to make it worth his while.

Rest of the cast is pretty good - they do their best - but really even with the twists and turns the outcome is almost predictable but ridiculous -

A waste of time and money and energy and talent.

It isn't a brain teaser - although it appears to be that, and it tries to be intelligent but misses the mark.",1
29 April 2021,Glad I give it a chance,"It was one of those movies you see recommend on Netflix for a year but never really catch your interest.

The movie has its ups and downs. A bit slow in the second act, but you have to keep on watching for the ending, wich i really didn't see it coming (I mean, i knew it would end that way, but it reached the result in a different way).

Overall good movie and still enjoyable in 2021.

31 August 2015,One Of The Best Thrillers Of All Time,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""The Game"" (1997) is a true example of superb, edge of your seat and intelligent thriller. Everything works in this movie so good, that you will be glued to your screen during the whole movie. Saw this movie back in 1997, and 3-4 times after - it hardly gets better than this.

Michael Douglas stars in one of the best films of the great David Fincher (first one is STILL his ""Se7en"" in my opinion) and he does a superb job in creating a wealthy man who gets a birthday present of a lifetime called as ""The Game"". When ""The Game"" starts, you are in a thriller ride of you lifetime.

Overall, ""The Game"" is a good as thriller can possible be. It's not the best of all time, but it is unforgettable movie. Scene by scene you will be involved in this picture, and by the very end you will definitely say, ""what a great movie that was"".",10
29 July 2023,Underappreciated,"Released in 1997, just in between two of Fincher's master films, Se7en and Fight Club this movie never got the attention it truly deserved. Always overlooked by fans and critics, The Game stood in the shadow of Fincher's better films for too long, but it remained an absolute gem if you ask me.

A very fast-paced mystery movie, that keeps you entertained with all the shocker reveals and your mind in doubt under every twist! Dissolved immensely into the film, you can't know for certain whether it's all a harmless prank, a psychotic episode, a fun game, or a criminal ripoff. And oh boy nothing can prepare you for the final act, elaborate on multiple counts.

27 January 2023,Top-notch thriller with a complex script competently directed by David Fincher,"San Francisco , ruthless financer Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a control freak who no longer knows the meaning of fun or frienship . When his estranged , addictive brother Conrad (Sean Penn) enrolls him with a company called ¨Consumer Recreation Services¨ for his birthday , his curiosity is aroused by the offer of a mysterious Game tailored to needs of each participant . At his first application is rejected , but when , on TV , a newscaster begins talking directly to him , Van Orton realises the game's already started and that his actions are being monitored and manipulated . Van Orton goes into the dangerous Game and later on , he tries to pull out of it , but too late . The Game...You Just Lost. It's simple, Play or be Played. Players Wanted. Are you ready to play? The object of the game is to discover the object of.... The Game. What do you get for the man who has everything?.You don't play it, it plays you. John 9;25: ""I was blind, but now I see.""There are no rules in The Game.ed to the needs of each participant.

¨The Game¨ results to be a suspenseful , twisted , intriguing and at times depressing film , in which our starring attempts to find out the mystery in which he becomes involved until a surprising result , as he'll stop at nothing to achieve his purports and at whatever cost . Although the movie's message about complacency transformed by chaos and uncertainty is hackneyed , the alarming twists and turns of the ingenious , witty storyline hold the attention throughout . Interesting and brooding script from John Brancato and Michael Ferris with full of plot twists , surprises, mysteries and fateful happenings . As the privacy of our protagonist is progressively invaded and the situations in which he finds himself become ever more life-threatening . Michael Douglas stars Van Orton giving a terrific acting as a driven wealthy businessman given an opportunity to participate in a mysterious game, desperate to discover the truth , while his life is turned upside down as he begins to question if it might really be a concealed conspiracy to destroy him. This excellent movie is perfectly interpretated by a magnificent plethora of actors playing attractive roles with a great support cast , such as : Sean Penn , Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn , Peter Donat , Carroll Baker, Anna Katarina, Armin Mueller-Stahl , among others.

Displaying an intriguing and moving musical score by great composer Howard Shore . Equally , a glimmer and colorful cinematography by cameraman by Harris savides. This charming and suspenseful motion picture was compellingly directed by David Fincher , though it results to be overlong . David has directed 7 actors in Oscar nominated performances: Brad Pitt, Taraji P. Henson, Jesse Eisenberg, Rooney Mara, Rosamund Pike, Gary Oldman, and Amanda Seyfried. Fincher has shot TV commercials for clients that include Nike, Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Heineken, Pepsi, Levi's, Converse, AT&T and Chanel. He has directed music videos for Madonna, Sting, The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, George Michael, Iggy Pop, The Wallflowers, Billy Idol, Steve Winwood, The Motels and, most recently, A Perfect Circle. As a film director, he has achieved huge successes with Seven (1995), Fight Club (1999) , Panic Room (2002) , The Social Network (2010) , The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) , Gone Girl (2014) , Zodiac (2007) and this ¨Game¨(1997). Rating , Game: 7.5/10. Better than average. The picture will appeal to thriller buffs . Well worth watching.",7
6 May 2021,A Game That Is Guaranteed to Change His Life,"This film begins with a cold-hearted banker by the name of ""Nicholas Van Orton"" (Michael Douglas) living in a large house all by himself because he has essentially driven off everyone close to him because of his unfriendly demeanor. So one day he is surprised when his younger brother ""Conrad"" (Sean Penn) shows up and offers him a birthday gift card from a company that specializes in a game that is guaranteed to change his life forever. Curious about it he visits the company and after a complete physical is told to wait for further instructions. Not long afterward his entire world is torn apart as he becomes convinced that people are actually out to kill him. What he doesn't realize is how much of his experiences are actually real. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film with the mystery and suspense being maintained from start-to-finish. Likewise, it also had plenty of action and good performances by everyone involved as well. In short, I recommend this movie to those who might enjoy a film of this sort and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.

13 July 2008,Game over,"What really sets ""The Game"" apart is the metaphysical undercurrent. As a mystery action-thriller, it's great, full of plot-twists and tension. As the game that central-character, Nicholas Van Orton, was offered unfolds, and prank after elaborate prank turns to deadly ambiguous reality, Nicholas loses control of his life but also finds himself as the traveler in a Danteesque hell.

The metaphysical meaning is this: the whole experience works as some sort of purgatory for Nicholas, who gets a chance to redeem himself of his sins (him being a ruthless capitalist businessman and alienated from pretty much everyone around him). At the start of the game, the mysterious organization company CRS (a sort of god, though in the end guided by the mere mortal players' wishes) evaluates Nicholas and his abilities, so that it organizes the perfect experience for him. At the apex of the game, and when Nicholas loses his money, he is being left for dead in a cemetery in Mexico. He metaphorically dies and is reborn a changed man.

The director, David Fincher (of ""Seven"" and ""Fight-Club"" fame) obviously had a ball filming this.",8
28 December 2021,better than I had expected,"I enjoyed this must better than I had expected although I had to say that I thought it was great and then wasn't sure I want it to change and just about I was okay it change back again. I reckon that must be good and I suppose I prepared the earlier David Fincher films, like Seven (1995) and Fight Club (1999) like this one. I liked Michael Douglas, as I usual do, but not very keen on Sean Penn but did like Deborah Kara Unger I also liked in David Cronenberg's Crash (1996).

11 May 2013,Ridin' the game out,"Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called ""the game,"" which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life.

After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for ""the game,"" he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that ""the game"" itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious.

Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice.

Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one.

""The Game"" in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to ""live"" or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years.

Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well.

Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher.",8
11 October 2015,That ending though...,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say?

18 December 2014,Fincher's under appreciated gem.,"I don't tend to write reviews on IMDb, but saw this gem and was compelled to do so simply due to the fact it isn't mentioned AT ALL, by anyone. It's one of Fincher's best films and deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Fight Club, Se7en etc etc.

It starts by slowly showing us the world of Nicholas (Michael Douglas) and how he's alone on his 48th birthday. He receives and odd gift off of his brother which he then decides to follow up on. What follows then is sheer cinematic brilliance. It's dark, unpredictable and unrelenting. It got to a point where any single character couldn't be trusted, and it made it all the more gripping. Seeing the protagonist descend slowly into desperation made us feel empathy for him. There's not much to say other than it's a typical Fincher film. Including his long tracks, his persistent use of the tripod, and I think it really compliments the story and builds up this sense of unease.

I just needed to express my gratitude for everyone who worked on this film and obviously David Fincher himself. It's so underrated and should be classed as one of his best films - without a shadow of a doubt.

Enjoy. You won't want it to end.",10
3 December 2008,"A ridicules, well-done thriller. Wait . . . what?","The Game doesn't try to be anything except a standard, well-done thriller with an intelligent moral. In David Fincher's mind, that was all he was trying to accomplish. Did he do it? Well . . . I'm not sure I have a definitive opinion either way.

On a technical level, The Game certainly succeeds. David Fincher knows how to use a camera, and I'm not sure anyone, including the most negative reviews of this film, could say otherwise. The Game creates a flawlessly dark atmosphereliterally, but not so much figuratively. Instead of jumping on the wagon and trashing the viewer over the head with horror clichés as similar movies do, The Game slowly builds up to its over-the-top moments in an attempt to immense the viewer in reality before going into the unbelievable. If this movie were in the hands of any other director but Fincher, it would have been the single biggest cliché-fest in cinematic history because it wouldn't practice any subtly whatsoever. For example, the clown in the opening of the movie was fully grounded in The Game, but in any other movie would have just looked like a cliché prop. This is a credit I do have to give Fincher . . .

But it's also a credit I have to take back by the end of the movie. Simply put, I've seen a lot of unbelievable movies, and I usually vouch for them. ""Unbelievable movies are rarely as unbelievable as real life,"" is something you'll always hear me say. Not so with The Game. At all. By the midway point, the level of ridicules things happening brought to me to the point of laughing. Though other reviews have taken the time to carefully label and point out every plot hole, there is one big one that few people are seeing. The people behind the game could not know every single move the main character would make to such a precise degree. Period. When you finally figure this out by the middle of the movie, the entire plot become worthless and very formulated.

The other major problem I had with The Game is it's absolutely nothing new or original in the least. Thriller writers have used this exact plot so many times it's second nature to the hardcore thriller fan, such as myself.

And when I say ""rehash"" I mean it in every way I can. The Game is so slow-paced and tedious, not to mention repetitious, I could honestly see people shouting ""We get it, come on!"" at the screen. Oh the irony: what is the point of a thriller if it isn't thrilling? Entertainment valuealongside originalityis almost a dead concept among modern directors, isn't it? They're so fixed on making sure their movies have some sort of cliché, pretentious social commentary they forget that watching a movie was once, dare I say it, a fun thing to do.

Don't get me wrong. When I say movies lack entertainment value, that doesn't mean I'm not all for movies that scar the viewer and show them something meaningful, but The Game isn't that either. The big moral point at the end is just another cliché in the pit of clichés The Game already was. We got it back with A Christmas Carrol and It's a Wonderful Lifewhy did we sit through this tedious movie just to hear old news? Excuse the overused pun, but in every aspect The Game loses. It leaves the viewer feeling like they were just cheated in the same way the main character was, but not in the meaningful way. More in a ""I could have done the laundry in the time it took to watch that pointless movie!"" kind of way.

Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",10
21 April 2006,a thriller with enough paranoia and gusto to be one of the better films of 97,"The Game is basically an elaborate hoax, but unlike at least several others I've seen over the past several years, director David Fincher gets something really right about this one. The fact is the plot is so convoluted at times, so pumped with the kind of paranoia and surrealism to give Hitchcock the willies, that it almost works to annoy the viewer with the amount of manipulation it puts across. But, as it turns out, it is more about being manipulated than it is about, well, to put it this way, the audience isn't necessarily cheated as in a lessor picture. Adding to the intelligence level of the audience (or, for some, lack thereof) is superlative craftsmanship on the part of Fincher, who has carved out for him with his roster of films from the 90's quite a nook of edge-of-your-seat thrills that, at the least, isn't boring.

Michael Douglas is really excellent here as well, on par with some of his best work of the past decade and a half. At first his performance seems rather subdued, like a distilled version of those businessmen he plays in almost every other movie he's in. Again, part of the manipulation not just on the audience, but tenfold on the lead character. Nicholas is given a birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn), and it turns out to be 'the game', where anything can happen, and rather relentlessly at that. Soon Nicholas, cold and sort of detached from those around him, becomes super-duper paranoid and on his toes as the CRS (Consumer Recreational Services, ho-ho) goes to work on him. Pretty soon he has no money, no home, almost no life. Or is it? It's not too inappropriate to have the opening image over the credits of jigsaw puzzles is not far from what the film is itself, just one huge set laid out on the carpet.

If there could be anything that started to bug me as the film started to near its climax, it would be that, well, it's a reminder of both how much I like and dislike getting mind-f***ed by a movie, particularly a brilliantly shot-one like this. And the more I think about it, however, it may possibly lack something that Fincher's follow-up, Fight Club (possibly his best film to date), had, which was a connection of character to some kind of statement about something. Has the hoax that ends up showing itself as amounted to something in the way that it should've, or could've? The cat-and-mouse factor of the script, direction and acting, and the whole atmosphere is probably on par with Fincher's other work, but is there a connection with how Nicholas was and how he does become, or is it all meant for the gimmick?

Still, with this observation, if not quite a criticism, I still recognize this film as being a mile ahead of other films that have come in its wake. Too often do I see a film where a lead character- or characters- get the run-around (so to speak) just for the sake of the script. This time in the Game, the director- by way of the almost TOO convincing performances (that scene between Douglas and Penn in the car & stairs at night had me talking to the screen for the right and wrong reasons)- doesn't insult the audience's expectations. Bottom line, go in with a suspension of disbelief, and it's one of the better elaborate hoaxes put on film in the 90's.",9
22 December 2012,Read some of the negative reviews before deciding to see this,"I watched this based on having read many positive reviews. If I had read the negative reviews, I would probably have given it a miss. The main thread common to most all of the poor reviews is how things so quickly spin out of control with absurdity piled on absurdity, finally reaching an ending that ranks with the most ridiculous I have seen.

Things start out well enough with Michael Douglas playing the self-important, officious, extravagantly wealthy financier Nicholas Van Orton. Douglas carries this role off well, a talent he has shown in other movies. Things start to go wrong when Van Orton signs on to ""The Game"" with a company known as CRS. The game is presented as a mysterious life changing experience with no specifics offered. There is no way a person like Van Orton would have innocently agreed to the detailed interrogation he was subjected to at CRS in order to participate in some game. He would have sent out a fleet of lawyers and investigators to find out every last detail about this company before ever having anything to do with them.

Once Van Orton does sign up for the game, things only get more and more unbelievable. The intent is to have the audience guessing what is real and what is part of the game, but, if you are a realist, this hocus-pocus will cease to hold your interest.

Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger (who plays Douglas' main antagonist) try to stay serious in what is essentially a frippery. While on screen only briefly, Sean Penn plays Van Orton's brother with the appearance of having participated in this foolishness on a lark.

I give the movie credit for its high production values.",2
30 October 2016,"A Thrilling Tale, though it May Fall Flat,","The Game is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It is a very thrilling movie as we see a man get involved with an organisation that he can not seem to get himself out of. It has all the elements you would expect from a David Fincher movie, his talent for telling a story and setting up a dark, eerie atmosphere is very evident here.

The film did feel too muddled for its own good, there was a sense that they were making it confusing for its audience because they did not know where they were going with it. Rather than building up the exciting twists and turns they had planned well in advance, the script felt like the writers were making it all up as they went on.

The ending is the major disappointment for me and makes the entire film as a whole feel very flawed. It is nowhere near as exciting as we would have anticipated, and I felt somewhat cheated on by this underwhelming finale.

The film shows that a thriller will not work to full effect if we are following a protagonist who really knows nothing, and finds out very little as the plot progresses. It could have worked better as a puzzle solver, rather than scene after scene that raises more questions than it answers. Thrilling and entertaining, The Game certainly does not shine as much as some of Fincher's other work, nor is it as enjoyable as Michael Douglas' previous thrillers, but I would still say it is worth the watch if you are looking for a good Mystery, just do not go out of your way to see it.

On his birthday, a wealthy businessman's brother gives him a present in which he becomes involved with the CRS, a mysterious organisation with unusual motives.

10 August 2021,"suspenseful, imaginative, life altering","All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score.

13 October 2014,Gripping Game From Start To Finish,"Plot In A Paragraph: Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton a rich man in obsessive control of his life. Van Orton's younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn) visits him and announces a birthday present: ""The Game,'' ""It will make your life fun again,'' he is promised, but that's not quite how he sees it, as soon everything starts to fall apart.

There are a few plot holes as many of the things that happen to him are implausible or even impossible, but so what? The events are believable in a nightmare scenario

Sean Penn is as reliable as always, Deborah Kara Unger is a decent supporting player, but James Rebhorn is not given as much to do as one would hope.

As for the main star, Michael Douglas is superb at playing men of power, he starts the movie like Gordon Gekko in ""Wall Street"" but ends up like his character in ""Falling Down"" who's name escapes me. Douglas is perfectly cast in the role. He can play smart, cold, angry, desperate and frustrated. And he does them all superbly.

One of Douglas's best, and one of Fincher's best too.",8
19 February 2023,The Game,"Filthy rich and not wholly pleasant investment banker, Michael Douglas, is given a birthday present by his far more free wheeling, ex drug addict brother, Sean Penn which is to take part in a game which will apparently change his life. Douglas goes along with this, but finds more and more serious action occurring that affect his life which he is not keen on and which eventually threaten his money and his life. To what extent is this really a game?

Being a David Fincher film there is strong element of deceiving the audience here and if you feel you can't suspend your disbelief (because it's easy to pick holes in this) and accept what is going on, which chips and changes throughout and often somewhat defies reality, the ending is quite a stretch, there's no point going along for the ride. If you can, it's a fun ride and Douglas is absolutely terrific in this and he's rarely off the screen.

1 September 2007,Puppet On A String,"Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy, and very unlikeable, businessman who has every material comfort and pleasure money can buy. So, his younger brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), gives Nicholas an unusual gift for his 48th birthday: an invitation to play an elaborate and mysterious ""game"", from a mysterious corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).

It's an intriguing film concept; a cold-blooded corporate exec submits to a proposition that forces him to function as a puppet on a string. We can imagine all sorts of humiliating challenges that this reptilian man must confront, what great payback.

Unfortunately, although it's a great concept, the story is awful. Nicholas' challenges are too physical to be believable. Most of the middle Act consists of repetitive encounters that cause Nicholas physical pain and/or major financial and logistical trouble. Over and over we see him confront ludicrous obstacles that are so contrived and improbable as to be silly. The problem here is that the script is written as a souped-up action movie, evidently to appeal to kids. The film presents all of this revved-up action well. But, given that Nicholas does not invoke the supernatural or super human skills, the film's plot is totally inconsistent with reality. Plot holes are everywhere.

The film would have been far better with challenges that are more cerebral, more realistic. But, of course, that would have bored the intended audience. As is, ""The Game"" comes across as an animated cartoon, aimed at youngsters.

The film's cinematography, acting, and production design are fine. I am disappointed that Michael Douglas would agree to play the lead role in a film wherein the story is so implausible, so ""cartoonish"".",
22 May 2022,Too dark,"This movie was not a success at the time of its release, despite the presence of Douglas and Penn, and it's easy to understand why: Douglas is misanthrope millionaire Nicholas, divorced, childless and living alone in a mansion on the eve of his 48th birthday, the same age of his father at the time of his suicide.

Enters brother Conrad, a wild boy with a chequered past who wants to make peace with Nick and gives him a ""fabulous"" gift: a surprise event - a ""game"" - organised by a mysterious company. Nick is not interested at first, but then he takes the bite and his life turns into a nightmare.

The audience is supposed to believe that the mysterious company can manage stunts it would take a miracle to accomplish (cover Nick's mansion walls with elaborate graffiti, have a TV personality speak to Nick through the screen, launch an attack with assault weapons in the middle of San Francisco without the police noticing, etc...) but even if you want to believe all that crap for entertainment sake, the most outrageous stunt comes at the end.

Nick is so enraged and paranoid by what he's been going through that he shots Conrad and immediately after, driven by remorse jumps to his death, like his father... only he does not, because it's only a game, albeit certainly not a funny one.",4
15 March 2007,American Lamo,"Nicholas Van Orton has everything - health, wealth, a nice house, and a general satisfaction with life. Life hasn't been easy for Nicholas - his father committed suicide and his wife left him, but he manages to get through smoothly. Smoothly until his eccentric brother comes to town and gives him an unusual birthday present - a ticket to a game. Now, whether Nicholas wants to be involved or not is irrelevant, because the game is already playing him...

This film draws a strange parallel to Bret Easton Ellis's novel ""American Psycho"" and also the film version which came out in 2000. Ellis told the story of a man who has everything and wants more and more to the point of obsession. ""The Game"" tells the story of a man who has everything, but frankly doesn't give a damn. Work is work, who cares. Nicholas Van Orton goes through the motions in way much like the notorious Patrick Bateman - up in the morning promptly, off to work, meeting, gym, lunch, phone calls, drive home, dinner, etc... Like a robot on autopilot. Nicholas Van Orton is annoyed by the slightest deviation from his finely tuned routine so the viewer can really see how much ""the Game"" is a hell for him.

Cleverly devised and continuously diverting until the end, the story is a brilliant and though provoking look at the worth of endless wealth. You can't do everything like Bateman tries, but you also can't do nothing like Van Orton tries. You have to do something. So why don't you? Go out and play. --- 9/10

15 October 2016,Paranoid Prefection,"I really don't know what else to say about ""The Game.""

Heavy in the absolute best sense of the word. I haven't seen anything else like it.

The cast was great, Michael Douglas is absolutely brilliant as the rich man trapped in a deadly game that he doesn't nearly understand. Deborah Kara Unger, the beautiful femme fatale, in a role that makes you wish Hollywood would use her more. And Penn as the loving Black Sheep of the family come together in a beautiful done Hitchcockian thriller that keeps you guessing until the end...

And boy does that end blow you away.

31 May 2006,let's all play,"When ""The Game"" first came out in theaters, I didn't really know much about it, so when I went to see it, I was pleasantly surprised. Portraying San Francisco banker Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) getting involved in a ""game"" that invades his personal life, the movie keeps you guessing every minute. I can say with certainty that I couldn't have predicted anything that happened in the movie. And that ending was sure a shocker.

One thing about the movie that really struck me was Sean Penn's performance. It had just been two years since he'd affirmed his presence on the silver screen with ""Dead Man Walking"", and he was now starring in this most perplexing film (around the same time, he also starred in the equally perplexing ""U Turn""). This all showed that he would soon have a solid filmography - not to mention become one of America's primary political activists.

But the point is that you're sure to have a good time watching this movie. It affirms David Fincher as a great director (he was also behind ""Fight Club"" and ""Panic Room""), and makes me nostalgic for autumn, 1997, when we also had movies like ""In & Out"", ""LA Confidential"" and ""Good Will Hunting"". Very well done. Also starring Deborah Kara Unger, Armin Mueller-Stahl and James Rebhorn.",7

The kind of movie when you have it figured out, it pulls a twist and a twist that MAKES SENSE! Not surprises out of nowhere but logical ""ah's"".

It is Michael Douglas at his best, and I totally forgot what a gem he is. Other acting is on key and not disappointing.

The movie hits the 90's mark. Brick cell phones, square cars, overly dark scenery. Ofcourse none of that matters, you watch a thriller for the plot and this thriller has a great plot.

I hadn't seen this movie for a good many years. Made back when Douglas was in his acting prime.

It moves at a steady pace with good flow. The surprises are plentiful given the basic premise.

Considering the lack of CGI and the effort in the script I wonder if we will see anything of its type come out of studios in more modern times?

Let's hope to see a movie of similar calibre some time soon.

25 April 2021,It became better and better as it progress,"For you thinking should you watch it: Definitely. It starts up a little slow and predictable but as it progress it became better and better. Great thriller! You will wonder whats going on to the very end. Its a game of doubt.

I recommend watching ""Open your eyes"" before this(because i saw a review there saying go watch ""The game"" for a whole experience) 😊. And if you like this type of movies ""Gone girl"" is a blast.

17 May 2022,"Interesting, If Minor, David Fincher Thriller","I'd not seen this since cinema release, so time had erased pretty much any sense of what happens other than the barest parts of the set-up. That made for an entertaining, diverting watch even if up to 30 minutes could easily have been trimmed at no loss and probably some improvement; the final half hour or so feel especially baggy. The screenplay feels a bit too obvious, and there's some promising reaching after bigger themes that doesn't really take hold. Michael Douglas is good, and the growing sense of paranoia is tangible; I loved how most of the game itself takes place in an eerily deserted night-time San Francisco, planting a suggestion that this might all be in the lead character's literal nightmares. It could have been more, but the still emerging craft and carefully knitted suspense makes it an interesting, if minor, entry in the director's career.

4 May 2021,Was okay,"It was an effective movie in certain parts but alas much of it didn't work. It kind of felt a bit thrown together plot wise to be honest. The ending was a little too predictable even though it was trying to be something bigger, better or even arty. It's a shame because I would've really enjoyed it. After all, it's David Fincher and we all know what a great director he became. Could say that it's proof in the pudding. Never judge someone and all their work but just on the bits you love.

11 January 2002,talk about suspense...,"I mean talk about suspension of disbelief! You not only have to do that you have to assume everyone including you are just plain stupid to believe that anything of this complexity could be actually planned out and I mean to a ""T"". They (the practical planners or whoever they really are) even knew and made perfect ""to the foot"" precision plans that make us assume that they know what our star will do and at what very moment and in what very precise direction he will display his extreme emotional distress?? I'm trying not to give anything away here so I'm being a little vague but if you've seen the film I hope you know what I mean (hint: it's at the end). I just can't believe Americans waste their money on this kind of absurdity and then actually think they've seen something of quality. This plot has so many holes in it that (I can't come up with a funny line here) well... it just does. The whole point of the movie is to trick the viewer. It's just utter nonsense IMHO. All these big budget slick spectacular movies coming out of Hollywood that have the finest filming and sets and lighting and special effects and superstars... and STUPID plot and characters that still make the American public come out with glazed eyes in droves quite frankly saddens me. I need an escapist movie now and then too but please don't tell me this movie is a serious suspense drama or anything like it. It's escapist at best and at that... it's drivel. I'd prefer a Superman movie to this because at least it's not pretending to be anything else. When I saw the ending of this movie I wanted my money back for the wasted time I had just spent. OK... I'm done. 1 star",1
22 May 2015,Fincher's Followup to Seven,"Wealthy San Francisco financier Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) gets a strange birthday present from wayward brother Conrad (Sean Penn): a live-action game that consumes his life.

This is a strange film, and one that is hard to follow at times because it is so unexpected. One could rightly call it two hours of red herrings. Never get too attached to any characters or scenes, because they could change or disappear at any time. Is this a strength or a weakness?

What strikes me is that this film was picked up by Criterion. Not saying it did not deserve their attention, but it is a bit unusual. The movie is not old, foreign, independent... it is not a movie that slipped under the radar (though it is not as well-remembered today as some of Fincher's other films). Well played, Criterion.

The acting is flawless, unfortunately it's within a ridiculous plot that is not only depressing, but unrealistic to the point that it loses your attention. The ending is the worst part as it finally puts it all in perspective. The point of this movie was . . . nothing. Nothign was the point. I can't believe this movie was made, but moreso, I can't believe how much talent and effort was wasted in the process.

30 December 2020,What an ending of a film.,"It is a very good film, with lots of twists and turns in the film, with and ending which has a big turn and then another, which I didn't see coming. I liked that each clue that he was given helped him, I just wished that there were more of them, as they were such a lovely key part of the movie. Also if the rest of the film was as great as the ending was, it would have been an even better film I believe. Plus the film's ending is almost like a Nolan ending, so if you like Christopher Nolan I would definitely recommend this film to you. Overall it is a film I would enjoy watching again, and again.

Having said this, I must admit that I have a friend who would have loved this movie. But he is a fan of Stephen King. So that doesn't count.

30 July 2021,Not as entertaining as I wanted it to be,"Well this was a weird movie for me as although I was intrigued with the story, I wasn't entertained by it. The first half of the movie didn't excite me that much, but it got a better in the second half until the end where it got all a bit crazy with the plot twists. The positives of the movie are that I thought the action scenes where good and the plot wasn't that hard to follow which was great considering the nature of it. I know this is a movie, but some of the stuff that happend in it weren't realistic which bothered me. I wanted to find this movie great, but I just didn't enjoy enough for that to be the case.

17 February 2013,The Game — Tightly woven suspense with great attention to details,"The Game is a great suspense by David Fincher that will keep you guessing until the very end. The quality is evident, because its age doesn't show at all.

The sound environment and music are extremely well thought out to completely immerse you in the game. Rich set and wardrobe, as well as smooth camera work and editing will completely cocoon you, keeping your attention well riveted on the screen. The scenario will captivate and won't release you before the movie ends, with a series of intriguing and tightly woven scenes.

This is one of my favorite role of Michael Douglas, even better than Wall Street (review upcoming) because he's less of an ass hole here.

29 August 2019,Honoring David Finchers 57th birthday,"""They won't leave me alone! I'm a goddam human piñata!"" Such a great psychological thriller starring the glorious Micheal Douglas! I absolutely crave mind-bending suspense genres, it's my favorite thing in a film or out of one especially to talk about profound philosophical theories. I have only seen The Game maybe 6 or so times compared to my favorite film ever Fight Club probably watched 25 times including special features and memorizing most of it.

David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino's films are my favorite directors/writers if I get the opportunity to meet either one I'd probably poop myself lol! Sean Penn is perfection in this and his shirt near the end is delightful!

27 June 2021,Fincher perfectly manipulates the audience and keeps his foot on the throttle once it gets going,"David Fincher taps into what Michael Douglas does best in playing ordinary men slowly disintegrating through circumstances beyond their control in a performance that is reminiscent of a cross between Wall Street (1987) and Falling Down (1993), all done with an Hitchcockian verve in this entertaining edge of the seat thriller.

There is a lot to enjoy here if you are willing to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride as Douglas's character spirals deeper and deeper into a game of real life peril that takes him right out of his comfort zone. If such a game really did exist it's probably the sort of thing a rich brother would get his sibling, especially as boys like to play pranks on one another. Brother Sean Penn decides to give Douglas the ultimate gift for his birthday to stir things up in his life but this elaborate game takes things a little too far and plunges him into a seemingly life threatening nightmare.

Fincher perfectly manipulates the audience with this one and keeps his foot on the throttle once it gets going as one thing after another drives the Douglas character literally to the edge.

While The Game does stretch viewer loyalty rather thinly towards the climax you are so desperate to find a resolution after 2 hours of tension that you'll be willing to accept it's flaws and be glad to catch your breath.",7

I loved the acting, Michael Douglas was amazing as was the rest of the cast. This movie will make you question your own thinking lol. It's a different kind of film and I love it bc of that. They sure as heck don't make them like this anymore. Nowadays nothing really surprises me or keeps me twisted up like this did. Wow wow wow.

23 May 2022,This film was just great!!!!,"As a movie buff, it takes a lot for me to give a movie a 9. This film had sooo many twists and so hard to predict, and the acting was of the highest quality, it deserves nothing less than an 8. I'm completely blown away!! Films of the 80's and 90's seem to be so much better and I think it's because they had to rely less on CGI and great special effects, and more on the writing and the dialogue. Really enjoyed this film and MOST DEFINITELY worth a watch!!

26 November 2022,Possibly the Most Implausible Movie Ever,"The Game requires something far beyond suspension of disbelief. I admit, the movie keeps your interest most of the way through and the suspense runs high, but as it works toward the conclusion, it becomes so implausible as to be completely preposterous.

Michael Douglas plays a wealthy investment banker given a mysterious gift by his black sheep brother (played by Sean Penn): an opportunity to play a game run by a vaguely named corporation that promises to change his life. That's about all that can be said of the plot without giving anything away.

David Fincher's prior movie, Seven, was a thriller so tightly wound that it omitted a main player from the opening credits so as not to give anything away. Even knowing how Seven ends, I'd enjoy watching it again. I can't say the same about The Game. Any rewatch would be spent trying to see if the plot holes are as gaping as they seemed even right after watching it.",4

2 June 2007,Terrible movie,"I am a long time IMDb lurker, first time commenter. Allow me to start with my conclusion: I was flat out offended by this movie's supposition that I would be too blinded by senseless suspense to apply logic or rationality. This movie is simply incoherent and somehow tries to have profound meaning.

The Game is essentially a modern adaptation of the Ebenezer Scrooge story. The only notable difference being that The Game makes far less sense than the original (despite the fact that said original involves ghosts embodying the living dead and bilateral time travel). The viewer is to believe the protagonist is lead via elaborate scheming to have a life changing insight. Unfortunately for the scriptwriters, this scheming involves innumerable logical paradoxes. Any attempt to compile these retardations here would result in my death (likely by suicide). I can only hope that I may still sleep tonight knowing that, thanks to this movie, a throng of people think that so-called 'squib bullets' can pierce through the window of a BMW and pose no threat to anyone in the vicinity.

Do not see this movie.",1
5 September 1999,7 on a scale of 10,"As always, Michael Douglas is fantastic. If not for him, this preposterous movie would never have been made.

I watched with the interest and intensity of an 8 on a scale of 10, but when it was over, I had to vote. It's kind of like eating something good (8), but the after taste is a 5. I mean you have to forget what it tasted like initially, because you are in the present - and sometimes the present tastes pretty bad. Thus a 7 on a scale of 10.

My problem was that after it was all over and the mystery all solved (except for the blood on the back of Penn's jacket - what's that all about????) I had to just shake my head over and over and over and the only word that came to mind was preposterous, preposterous, preposterous.

But, if you don't care or if you don't worry about that sort of thing or if you can hold your nose 5 seconds after the movie is over for at least as long as the after taste lingers, then you might really like this movie.

As for me, I enjoyed the 2 hours, but I will not remember it fondly.",7

22 July 2021,"Good, but not great","Overall a good, but not great, movie. It is entertaining. It is suspenseful. It is full of action. And the acting is really good, and well cast.

On the down side, it's highly contrived and requires serious suspension of belief to enjoy. I think that's the twist, in a bad way. The movie begs for analysis by coaxing the audience to figure ""it"" out. But on the other hand, to really enjoy the movie you have to forget about reality completely. Yes, just like most action movies, comic book movies etc. So in a sense, this movie is not novel or creative at all: the writer(s), director(s) and producer(s) simply took the easy way out for quick satisfaction for the masses.

Yes this movie will appeal to most people, it's designed that way, and audiences are conditioned to accept. My mom loves this movie and and probably your mom will too.

That all sounds negative, and it's not. It is a good movie, just not a great one. I don't think it rises to the level of ""classic"" or great by any stretch of the imagination. It's easy to get caught up in the emotion and call this a 10, and I understand that perspective, but I think it's a solid 5 because it relies so heavily on tired Hollywood smoke and mirrors disguised as creativity.

My point is that, as enjoyable as it is to watch the action, and feel the suspense, and guess the next scene, it's based entirely on the audience conveniently giving in to a storyline that ultimately makes no sense.",5
21 January 2016,Quickie Review: The Game,"It's been some years since I've seen The Game. I remember enjoying it very much so. Despite being a step down from his previous film, David Fincher's second outing in urban thriller-mode feels like something of a taut modern classic. A neo-Hitchcock movie if I ever saw one.

The film follows a dull and greedy investment banker who is given a card as a birthday present by his brother, who tells him to phone up the company whose expertise lies in some form of enigmatic character building game. Despite phoning up and attending an arranged test he is told he did not qualify. However, after this our protagonist finds some truly odd thing occurring in his life. Are these events real, or are they a part of 'the game'? What follows is an engrossing roller coaster ride with enough twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat during the course of its runtime. You never really know what's coming next.

Douglas and Penn as brothers are on form in a film I'd recommend to anyone. It's a fun movie for a Saturday evening, but not one that assumes its audience are idiots. Quite the opposite, in fact. If I had any complaints about the film it would be the ending which, for a movie that was pretty believable for the most part, required a lot of suspension of disbelief

Best Scene: Like I said it's been sometime since I've seen it. One part still remains in my mind, however – Douglas is visited by a frantic Penn begging him to forget everything about the game. It's a real um, game-changer in the film because it was the scene that cemented the realisation that ""Oh, hang on. Things are serious here."" (Or so I thought.)",8

10 March 2015,I Hated to Love It!,"I was supposed to hate it because its premise is gimmicky... And it is. I'll tell you that up front because I'd hate to have you watch it then blame me 'cause I didn't warn you.

But it's got that dram of Fincher smarts that transmutes the leaden premise and spins it into... Well, maybe not *gold*, but something distinctly better than lead.

Seriously: Once I smelled that premise, I staunchly decided to hate the flick. But I kept watching, and got swept up in the majesty of the execution; notably, the direction.

I'd go so far as to class this flick with others about which it can be said that a great myth can cover many cinematic sins. But this one has only one real sin to cover (the premise), and it succeeds, in my book.

17 February 2003,Hard to swallow.,"Now how do I swallow this? As a pill or should we crunch it down into a liquid form? Whatever you do, it's a hard film to swallow. Far fetch may be the solution but you have to admire these filmmakers' desperate attempt to force feed us with this plot about a rich person's morality game. Michael Douglas tries in vain to convince us that he is a cold ruthless financial head, rolling in money and ego, (WALL STREET all over again?). But his little brother, Conrad, (Sean Penn in another manic performance), sets him up for a gift he'll never forget. Director, Fincer, uses his technical craft to enhance the thrills but if you're quick, you'll work out the ending fifteen minutes into the film.

19 January 2023,A Game Within A Game Within A Game,"Once in awhile a movie comes along that completely alters your understanding of what a good movie is. This was the movie that did that for me. It has raised the bar on my expectations of movie-making and what can be accomplished.

I'm not sure I can adequately describe how epic this movie feels in every sense. There is a reverence and respect for every element that goes into filming a movie. It comes together as a beautiful work of art. The set design, music, casting - it's all perfect and no detail is spared or overlooked.

There is a grand, atmospheric feeling to the entire film that makes it an unparalleled cinematic experience. It is subversive, dark, chaotic, and like being trapped in a hall of mirrors. One gets a feeling of paranoia by viewing this film and then they begin to question if their own life is a game, and to what extent. There is a cat and mouse quality to many scenes that creates a feeling of constantly being on the run and that it is never safe to stand still, even for a second. The movie unfolds somewhat like revealing the inner layers of a matryoshka doll - there are unending layers to the game.

This review would not be complete without mentioning Deborah Unger, who I found to be absolutely captivating. She has a sultry, simpering manner of speaking that I'm not sure I've ever seen before. There is this off-handedness that comes off as rude but also very sexy and vixen like.

Viewing this well into the 21st century, I now understand that the late 90s were a golden era for films like these that really celebrate the art of film making. This movie feels whole, complete and classic, like a fine wine that must be sipped many times over to grasp the full complexity it offers.

A masterpiece, and a benchmark for filmmaking.",10
15 August 2015,"An intelligent, gripping drama, filmed with crisp efficiency","A very solid, thoughtful and stylish outing from made with great precision that is becoming a hallmark of David Fincher. His interest in 'films that scar' continues, and while this film doesn't top quite the heights of the remarkable Se7en, it is still a very worthy achievement, thanks to a trenchant yet subtle performance from Michael Douglas. The script is solid, but it is really the effective partnership between Douglas and Fincher, as well as great supporting acting turns from Sean Penn, James Rebhorn and Debra Kara Unger, which really helps ground this slow burning but always engrossing psychological thriller. You have to pay attention, but as the plot twists and turns it does work its way to a satisfying if surprisingly climax (especially for a director of Fincher's background) you'll enjoy the way that Douglas's Nicholas Van Orton character is stripped of his layers of reserve and control as the character is cleverly placed in one crisis after another.

Technical credits are as usual very polished – production design and Haris Savidies's photography stand out, but its Howard Shore's minimalist score that really enhances the mood of the film brilliantly. While the score has some of the dark overtones of Se7en, it is not as dark as that movie but still works very well to make the viewer fell unsettled – in particular the use of a sole piano is extremely effective in certain scenes. To cap it all it is slickly edited and comes together with a crisp efficiency. Overall another film that firmly cements David Fincher's reputation as an extremely talented and uncompromising film-maker.",

19 October 2000,Bad ending!,"This movie could have been a modern hitchcock style classic in the mold of Vertigo if only they did not sell out to that commercialised happy ending.The ending they chose,although still entertaining,destroyed the legitimacy of the plot and drove the level of the film down very quickly.So quickly in fact,you only start to realise it as soon as you see Dougas talking to the leading lady by the waiting taxi.Then the reaization dawns upon you that this movie was ruined.Just like countless other movies now adays,soooooo close......

17 September 2006,Douglas was Outstanding,"Enjoyed watching Michael Douglas,(Nicholas Van Orton), play the role of a very rich man who had everything in the world and a huge mansion that reached to the sky as well as the windows. Nicholas had not seen his brother, Sean Penn, (Conrad Van Orton) for quite a few years and all of a sudden he appears at the front door and goes to dinner with Nicholas and gives him a very very special Birthday Card & Gift; which is not willingly accepted by Nick and it takes him quite a while before he accepts. This gift is something I would not want to receive, however, there are some rewarding experiences which draw people loser together than they had been before. Deborah Kara Unger appears in this film and gave a great supporting role, however, there is no love making in this picture for her. Michael Douglas put his heart and soul into this role and gave an Outstanding performance. Enjoy

30 October 2018,"Contrived, nonsensical balderdash","I saw this movie tonight, knowing nothing about it, with my father. We both concluded it had to have gotten a horrible rating because it was the most preposterous bunch of nonsense I've ever seen which demanded it be taken seriously by its audience.

There are so many ways the main character SHOULD have died, which the game people could NEVER have predicted ahead of time... it's beyond absurd.

It reminds me of a comic which did this exact thing with the plot... and pissed off almost its entire audience. Seems comic nerds have better taste.

5 January 2023,"""Discovering the object of the game is the object of the game.""","I have seen this movie so many times since it came out, and it's probably my favorite film. I can't think of any other movie remotely similar to it; it's immensely original and creative. I cannot praise it enough.

""The Game"" is about a man named Nicholas who, much like Scrooge from ""A Christmas Carol,"" has everything but is broken and unhappy because of his tragic past. His brother gives him a very unique present for his birthday - a gift card for a company named Consumer Recreation Services. All anyone will tell Nicholas is that this company sells some kind of ""game,"" an ""experience"" unlike no other. Once his game begins, the movie really takes off. Extremely bizarre events start occuring randomly around him, and he starts to question what is real and what is an illusion. To get any more into this would spoil it, but as one of the characters in the film says, ""First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.""

I've read through a lot of the reviews and see that there are some people who are unsatisfied with the ending, stating that it didn't make any sense. I completely disagree. The thing about ""The Game"" is that you're not just watching a character going through the game, you're also participating in a bit of a game, yourself. Like the promotional poster for the film, the story is a jigsaw puzzle. The film feeds you these ""jigsaw pieces,"" clues to the meaning of the story. By the end of the story, those jigsaw pieces will come together and paint the full picture. However, in order to truly see that picture, you have to be paying attention and trying to put that puzzle together yourself, not just relying on the film to do it all for you. You have to put yourself into someone else's shoes completely, not just think, ""Well, that's not what I would do."" This is Nicholas' game, and it would be different for each one of us. The psychological depth and the twists are just brilliant.

So, ""admit that it sounds intriguing"" and take the ride. It would be a huge pity to go by a few bad reviews and miss out on this masterpiece.",10
21 October 2006,"Cheap shots, all blanks","A movie with pretensions of profundity, shooting for a deep consideration of values, humanity and love, but hitting a great big sloppy marshmallow. Yes, it's clever, but in a clever-clever style, not an intellectually whimsical or psychologically complex manner. Douglas does Acting - look! Anger! Grief! Confusion! Penn does some strange parody of a nightclub singer (oh, that white tuxedo...) in a gangster movie. The only interesting moment is when van Orton pleads that the money isn't his, it's 'pensions and payrolls', a completely unrealised insight into the mythologies and hypocrisies of the economic system underpinning the movie. The script does nothing to convince, with dialogue by numbers and lots and lots of 'significant'eyeballing, or eyerolling. Even the cinematography is mundane and tired. The closing scene just offends with its 'enigmatic' quality, van Orton apparently stricken by either Botox or constipation. A hobbling attempt at the Deep and Meaningful. Avoid.

7 March 2004,High Class Hokum,"'The Game' is the sort of film that Hollywood does best. Michael Douglas plays Nicholas van Orton, a wealthy banker whose brother (Sean Penn) signs him up for a real-life game. When the game proves not to be too much fun, and van Orton finds himself unable to stop it, the question of where the game begins and reality begins is not easily answered. Director Fincher handles this material adroitly, ratcheting up the tension as van Orton fins himself in ever deeper trouble - but it's also very funny, the plot is preposterous, but enacted with such conviction that it keeps you gripped, even as you laugh at its sheer outrageousness. Full marks must go to Douglas (a natural in the role), Penn (playing uncharacteristically nerdy) and Deborah Unger, excellent as a tough and sexy femme fatale.

Fincher's films all seem to have a similar quality, films that dare you to take them seriously but which ultimately make fun of you if you do. 'Se7en' is senseless in terms of the motivation of its characters - 'Fight Club' appears at first to be a study of modern masculinity, but turns out to be just a very clever joke. The key is to enjoy the joke, and the ride, at the same time - and in enabling the viewer to do this, 'The Game' is perhaps his most successful (and least pretentious) work. I was riveted, and although it is nonsense, even moved by the end. Great stuff!",9
4 August 2011,"Dark, Gripping & Predictable Yet Nothing More Than Just A Game!","Immensely dark, intensely gripping & extremely unpredictable yet nothing more than just a game, The Game is a meticulously crafted, cleverly layered & fabulously narrated mystery thriller full of twists n turns that keeps playing with your conscience from its opening moments, takes you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions & completely flips on you the very moment you think you've got it all sorted out. Offering loads of fun despite its numerous plot holes, it's one game that comes delightfully recommended.

6 June 2006,"Where As Once I Was Blind, Now I Can See","****SPOILERS**** Multi-millionaire investment banker Nicholas Van Orton, Michael Douglas,has worked his way up to the top in the ruthless and dog eat dog world of high finance and corporate investments that he lost all contact with his feeling for his fellow human beings. Approching his 48th birthday Nick is very unsteady about his future in that back in 1959 when he father was 48 he committed suicide by jumping to his death after he was wiped out financially in the stock market.

Meeting his younger brother Conrad, Sean Penn, who had just been released from a substance abuse rehabilitation center at a local members-only restaurant in San Francisco Nick is given a strange birthday present by him; an all-expense paid invitation to be involved in a game sponsored by this agency called CRS. Nick promises Conrad that he'll look into to it and that's all. Nick did apply to be in the game and the game, and what Nick lived through playing it, changed his life and attitude of himself and his fellow human beings forever as well as for the better.

Things happen so fast and so unexpectedly that you,like Nick,never have time to get a grip of what's going on, not only to him but those he's involved with. Nick ends up getting into a number of life threatening situations in both San Francisco and later after waking up in a cemetery, in a coffin, across the border in Mexico.

Starting with a wild scene in a restaurant as Nick gets involved with a waitress Christine, Deborah Kara Unger, who spilled a glass of water on him. Nick and Christine end up being chased all over San Francisco by these unknown gunmen with Nick losing her and then later, after finding Christine, Nick also finds out that she's involved in whatever is happening to him. Nick, battered bloodied and totally confused makes his way back hitch-hiking from Mexico all the way to San Francisco. Finding his way to the offices of CRS Nick not only end up getting a double-shock to his system he's also hit by the true reasons that all these dangerous and near-fatal events were happening to him all throughout the movie!

You have at some times in the move ""The Game"" to suspend reality to fully enjoy it. Which isn't that hard with the story keeping you so involved to what's happening that you easily overlook it's many inconsistencies.

Every move that Nick makes seems to be monitored by the goons at CRS. Just when he thinks that he's finally got a handle to what happening to him and how to stop it, even at the cost of his life, the biggest surprise in a movie full of surprises hits him like a ton of brick. This happens after he falls some 30 floors and crashes through the skylight of a restaurant! It's there where everyone involved in the game being played on Nick are ready to wish him a happy 48th birthday.

You have to click on your seat-belt and put on your crash helmet to be able watch and sit through the movie but in the end you'll feel that it was more then worth it. The film makes it worth your while by getting, Nick and everyone in it, what has to be one of the most heart-stopping and hair-rising rides of your life.",8

24 September 2015,Dangerous games.,"This film tells how Nicholas Van Orton, a smug and cold millionaire, enters a bizarre and unique game that promises to play with his life. But when the game starts and Nicholas sees the twisted and perverse way unfolds, things start getting out of control. Directed by David Fincher (director of the film ""Seven""), features Michael Douglas as protagonist.

The truly wealthy have always had a reputation for being arrogant people, cold, impersonal, smug and only concerned about themselves and their business. Nicholas Van Orton was like that, even disregarding his own brother. And it is from him that Nicholas receives a different birthday gift: participation in a game organized by a mysterious company that everyone seems to know but about which nothing is said nowhere. Intrigued but afraid, Nicholas boards the game without real sense of where he is in, which says a lot about the personality of some rich people. The film will thicken up gradually, leaving the audience in anticipation and securing it constantly. It is an addictive movie where Douglas shows all its value and can brilliantly interpret your character. All this makes this film an excellent thriller, perhaps one of the best of the late twentieth century.",9
13 October 2012,Did not age well could only be my understanding to its success.,"Have always been a huge fan of Fincher's work (forgiving Alien 3), but this one is definitely not one of it. From the word go, it felt more like a B movie with ridiculous plot twists that are more contriving than intriguing. Going by the number of positive reviews, I think it just did not age well!!

Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is an investment banker and is a man who has everything. On his birthday, he receives a gift from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) who had a troubled past with addiction and mental imbalance. The gift is actually a life experience game designed specific for each individual based on their past and their thought process. Is it really a game? Is it an elaborate scam? Whether you like it or not, it is a Michael Douglas show from start to finish. It is an interesting concept to discuss it over a drink, but just does not seem feasible considering it is either not science fiction or fantasy. Once that is plotted in your mind, whatever happens on the screen just looked ridiculous for me and it is one of those thrillers where you want to get it over with rather than eager to see what happens at the end. Worst part was trying to getaway with a flat screenplay and editing that does not try to be either abstract or non-linear. At least that would keep the audience puzzled a bit. Sean Penn plays an important role and he does a decent job.

Did not age well could only be my understanding to its success.",4
9 January 2022,Ok,"Very suspenseful film, the ending .... Horrible. It felt as if a child were ending a story with 'it was all a dream in the end'. Other than that, very well written and executed.

9 March 2017,"Starts Off Slow, But Suspense/Mystery Builds To Incredible Finale","The director of ""The Game"", David Fincher, is well-known for his groundbreaking films that take viewers on psychological thrill rides. This one falls nicely into that categorization.

For a basic plot summary, ""The Game"" sees workaholic businessman Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) given a gift certificate to the mysterious ""CRS"" company by brother Conrad (Sean Penn). When Nicholas decides to give CRS a try, he is thrust into a far-reaching ""game"", of sorts, that touches every aspect of his life.

When this movie starts out, it looks like just any other Michael Douglas movie (where he plays the jerk boss). It is a bit slow to get off the ground and will have you wondering which direction the whole experience is taking. About 45 minutes in, though, the film kicks into high gear and only keeps accelerating until the end.

This is the type of movie that will have you thinking about its possibilities the whole way through. Just when you think you have it figured it, it throws you another twist again...and again...and again. By the very end, you'll even stop guessing and just resign yourself to the fact that Fincher is going to blow you away no matter what! I hate to call this a ""twist ending"" film, but it shares many of those same characteristics.

Overall, ""The Game"" impressed me with its ability to effectively create high drama, character development, and a sense of mystery throughout. If psychological thrillers are ""your thing"", then you can't go wrong here.",8
12 October 1999,My disbelief can only suspend so far,"There is nothing quite like Michael Douglas in distress, it doesn't get much better in an action-psycho-drama. But PUH-LEASE. The story, about a man caught up in a deadly game apparently run by a big-bucks San Francisco company, makes no sense at all. Spirited performances by the cast can't make up for plot holes big enough to coast a Mack truck through, and the finale is almost comical. With some considerable re-structuring of the plot this could have been a good movie.

9 March 2005,My brief review of the film,"Although in the end it all seems a bit too silly and far-fetched, this is a compelling thriller nevertheless for most of the time. It is able to shock, surprise, and make one think, and David Fincher shows that he has a sure hand when it comes to creating just the right atmosphere. As long as one can suspend one's disbelief for a couple of hours, the film is a thrilling ride, full of twists, turns and interesting tricks. It is all about tricking the viewer and less about exploring the drone life of a millionaire, but it does touch on such issues, and even if does not deeply examine them, there is enough in thrills, chills and style to keep one watching.

31 May 2022,Morality tale,"Nicholas Van Orton is a modern-day Scrooge: interested only in money, he overlooks the human side of things, firing people or getting them fired at the drop of a hat. Worse, he shuts out his loser of a brother, when he should be letting him in. Above all, he fails to understand that a birthday is supposed to be a special event, devoted to the celebration of one individual. (He has a back-story of course, which makes him more likeable.)

And this birthday, despite Nick's hatred of fun, he's going to get a lesson in the meaning of life, or at least a very intense experience. Caught up in the smoke and mirrors of ""The Game"", he'll have the hardest time figuring out what's real and what's illusion, who around him is authentic and who an actor. We've seen a similar dystopian conspiracy world in films like ""The Matrix"", but there the individual was incidental to the conspiracy. Here, everything is organized to mystify one man (like in the 1960s series ""The Prisoner"") -- and an operation of this scale obviously costs a lot of money, so it's no surprise if Nicholas has to open his wallet at the end. Fortunately, he has everything it takes to control people and get out of a jam: a Swiss bank account, an heirloom watch and a gun.

In the course of his journey through darkness, Nicholas will experience what it's like to wake up in an unpressed suit and rub shoulders with the poor. It would be wrong, though, to assume that this is like a chapter in the life of Buddha, teaching him a lesson about the misery of others: the people fired because of him turn out to be grateful! Instead, the moral of the story is: celebrate your birthday to the hilt. Be surrounded by crowds who are paid to clap for you, and you stand a chance of getting the girl no matter how bad you treat people!",9

12 May 2002,"Boring, uninvolving, silly and pointless. Need I go on?","'The Game' is yet another stinker from one of the most overrated film makers in Hollywood today, David Fincher. I could forgive the innumerable plot holes and general dumbness of this alleged thriller if I could actually feel some interest in pompous businessman Nicholas Van Orton's (a particularly dull performance from Michael Douglas) fate. And I could overlook Fincher's time wasting pretensions if it actually succeeded as a Hitchcockian man-on-the-run roller coaster ala 'The 39 Steps' or 'North By Northwest', but this overblown rubbish is such a chore to sit through that you'll breathe a sigh of relief when it finally ends. After that you'll ask yourself what the point of it all was. And you know what? There isn't one. Wanna absolutely waste two hours of your life? Then 'The Game' is tailor made just for you!

5 March 2014,Live a little. Place the game,"It's no surprise, this film, with it's originality of story, is steered by Se7en director David Fincher, though really at the time it was a low profile movie that came and went, hitting the video shelves within months that followed. Douglas of course fits this role, as a sour, bitter, ex divorcée, who lives a life of riches, as an investment banker, or something like that, with a great spread, and has just turned 48. His younger, coke dependant, mentally troubled brother (Penn, in good form) who like other people, close, who have been shunned away from him, gives him a gift, and thus what begins, becomes one living nightmare after the next. He's given this voucher for a mind and health improvement facility, called Consumer Recreational Services, where based on many questions and analysis's, improves that life of the person (player) who partakes in the test. I mean, really what do you give for the man who has everything. Okay, I will admit this movie is very far fetched, but there's a message there too. We see a little bit, how the Douglas character has became the way he is when witness to his father's suicide as a kid, in light coloured sepia tones of flashback done, in of fast motion, that are pretty cool, and creative. The character Douglas creates, that of Nicholas Van Orton, is one of longing fascination. He's an angry and one might say, though not really knowing him, intimately, grudgeful guy, but one thing of certitude, is that, he's not happy, or content. At the end of the film, we learn how the real game is played, as though one big joke has been played on us through the entirety of the movie, as Douglas too, but it's an exciting and maddening ride getting there. The jump scene and landing, like the one in Lethal Weapon, here, more spectacular, is just another far fetched moment, which has you asking, ""How can an ending like this exist?"" but for this film, it works. Douglas, who's never played it more straighter or stricter, and the shaky, fidgety character of Penn are two other reasons, apart from the film's originality to check this low profile, but ""goodie"" pic out. Not as good as Seven, but who's judging.",8

4 June 2012,"""The Game"" is just another reason why Fincher is hailed as one of the best living directors of Cinema.","A very smart thriller, the plot unfolds time to time and turns and twists and surprises and toys around with your mind and builds hyper- tension and plays a game with the viewers. ""The Game"" is just another reason why Fincher is hailed as one of the best living directors of Cinema. A highly imaginative piece of Cinema. The way Fincher sustains the intrigue throughout the movie and arouses the fear of excitement is just top-notch.

The visual style combining dark sense and imaginative/creative capabilities is always something to watch out for in Fincher movies. What he wants the audience to feel and imagine, we exactly feel the same way. That's always been his trademark!

The ending does have a few plot holes but with a little cinematic liberty, Fincher makes the whole movie-experience all the more interesting for us. Michael Douglas gives a riveting performance. He and Fincher together makes us experience the same emotions as Nicholas Van Orton character feels in the movie. So it turns out to be an emotional ride where we also along with the main character (playing The Game) don't know the truth till the last moment.

""You don't go to the Game, it comes to you!"" A really brilliant and clever movie. Must Watch.",8
7 February 2014,"Douglas and Fincher make a Dark, Mysterious Film","In a dark, dangerous San Francisco lives Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas), a very rich businessman and a total loner. He doesn't come across as pathetic, but as rather as stern and cold, and blatantly unhappy despite the lap of luxury in which he lives. Sensing Nicholas' unhappiness, Nicholas' wild and über ostentatious brother Conrad (Sean Penn) appears and presents Nicholas a birthday gift, a gift that is sure to add some excitement to Nicholas life, and lift him out of the depressive fog that he carries around everywhere.

Along the way we learn some little bits of information about Nicholas' life, but not much, which is nice because his past doesn't really seem to matter anyway. Fincher takes the character and forces him to deal strictly with the present time. All past regrets, misdeeds, and sins fall away when you are literally fighting for your life.

Conrad's gift is a game. A set of real life, role-playing scenarios designed and executed by a company alleged called CRS. We don't know what CRS is, and neither does Nicholas, so when bizarre happenings start to occur, such as the nightly news anchor breaking character and speaking directly to Nicholas in his living room, Nicholas cannot tell what is really happening. Is this part of the game? Or am I hallucinating? Soon the puppet masters at CRS crank up the intensity of the events. There are numerous attempts on Nicholas' life. At one point he wakes up in Mexico after having been buried alive in an underground tomb. The occurrences are so extreme, that as an audience, we are just as confused as Nicholas. It is real? Or is it a game? It is impossible to tell, and this is what makes this film so much fun to watch.

The world that CRS tailors to its clients is very cool and well put together. Even though Nicholas is told distinctly that the CRS game will begin, and it is not until after he is told this that strange and dangerous things start to happen, we are still unsure if it's game or reality. Fincher is essentially blurring our understanding of the common philosophical conventions of cause and effect.

The Game is a good thriller, and an entertaining watch. The production value of the film is excellent. It projects on screen in dark, shadowy tones, mixed with diverse textures setting one scene to next to a another composed completely different. The film is full of interesting settings from Nicholas' mansion, to a Mexican border town, to meetings in coffee shops, to cabins in the woods, but despite the actual events taking place being very entertaining to watch, the film never really establishes what truth it is trying to convey. The ending is disappointing. We are not left with any kind of substantial meaning.

The CRS experience is meant to be a massive, over-the-top shock to the nervous system. This shock forces one, Nicholas in this case, to decide whether he wants to fight to stay alive, or let go and die. Maybe we are supposed to take the hint and choose to live now, even though we don't have CRS to break us out of our depression and lethargy, as individuals, or as a whole society. But this might be pushing the limits of interpretation. Despite the absence of the deeper themes, such as investigating the pointlessness of existence as in Fight Club, or the proving the worthlessness of humanity as in Seven, The Game is still great watch. Once the film ends, it doesn't linger for days in the front of your mind like the best thrillers, but while your watching it you'll be on the edge of your seat, never knowing what it going to happen next.

27 May 2022,"Kept my attention, but pure fantasy","Love the idea of the film, that the main character doesn't know who to trust. But the movie brings up more questions than it can answer. By the end of the movie, what is happening is still quite vague. Entertaining but ultimately panders to the same audience that would like the ""Now You See Me"" franchise.

But the ending got me pissed!! The suspense was frustrating not exciting. I found the movie draggy and boring. The ending is so silly. If I was Michael Douglas I would have bashed my brother up big time!!!

Bottom line, don't believe the reviews all the time.

28 May 2017,The worst film i have ever seen.,"Before the final twist this film was heading towards the higher end of my favorites list. The ending made it the worst film of all time, take that as you will. Please do not put yourself through this great 2 hours of film, only to be feel like burning down the houses of whoever maniac sadist ever thought that that ending would be even slightly decent. This, from a massive David Fincher fan.

5 October 2015,Fincher's underrated masterpiece!,"David Fincher is one of the most talented film directors of his generation. When people talk about him, they usually brought up Fight Club, Se7en or The Social Network. But personally, I always found The Game to be his very best.

The Game is a terrific moody thriller with a very intelligent and unpredictable plot. Michael Douglas delivers a very strong performance and is perfect for the lead role. Deborah Kara Unger, Sean Penn and James Rebhorn are also pretty great in their roles too.

It's a truly great film, very entertaining and very underrated, highly recommended.

26 November 2014,Greatest Suspense + Thriller movies of all time!,"This movie is one of those movies which after you finish watching you will beg your friends, relatives and siblings to watch. Maybe neighbors too! There is one thrilling scene after another. And when you will think it is all over there will be some more to come. I know i have become bit biased after watching it but i do not think there was a single goof of any sort. There was no extra crap in the movie. No some one trying to be funny when the story has nothing to do with it. Its purely Genius. Michael Douglas shows his perfection in this movie by playing a Wealthy San Francisco financier, 'Nicholas Van Orton'. He is remarkable in this movie. So is Sean Penn who plays his brother. Any one looking for a mind blowing thriller and mystery. Watch THE GAME and you will regret every single second you spend not watching it. 9/10!

28 November 2022,A solidly entertaining mystery,"The Game is a solid mystery film that is perhaps let down slightly by a lacklustre final act that doesn't really bring things to a satisfying conclusion.

The premise is brilliant, and is for the most part very well explored. There are some very well executed twists and turns and it has a story that will keep you guessing.

The performance from Michael Douglas is very solid and engaging, as we embark on this mystery alongside him. There are some good turns from the supporting cast too.

As you'd expect from Fincher, the film is directed very well, and it feels slick and captures the atmosphere very well, even if certain elements do feel a tad dated.

If you enjoy unique mystery films then this will certainly be up your street, even if the end does feel a little rushed and poorly executed.",7

19 November 2008,Players Wanted.,"Nicholas Van Orton is a very wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is an absolute loner, even spending his birthday alone. In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide) his brother Conrad, who has gone long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, suddenly returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird and bad things start to happen to him.

If I had to pick one thing out of this movie that would have people talking for days or even months, or why the movie is talked about so many times (I assume, when it came out) was because of the ending. The TWIST ending. You're thinking it's just another twist ending, right? WRONG. This ending would either make you HATE the movie or LOVE the movie. At first, I didn't like it, or better phrased, I didn't get used to it. I may suggest people to see this movie more than once to get used to the ending because it's going to be stuck in your throat for quite awhile.

So what's so controversial about this twist ending? I don't know. Well, I do know but you have to find out for yourself. I'm not going to ruin the surprise. I've probably build it so much that you're wanting to watch this movie already. I'm sorry I did that. Let's get back on topic. What I loved about the movie, after seeing it for the second time and after I got used to what I just saw, I loved the twist ending because it provides a moral. Yes, indeed the ending provides a moral, much along like a fairy tale story. It's like loving ""Citizen Kane"" because of its ending.

However, the whole movie was very ingenious. Very unpredictable, I must add. This may be even one of the most unpredictable movie you'll ever see in your life! *sigh* OK. This movie will sure make you think a lot. Before I continue, I literally thought about this movie in my sleep the day I saw it. I was still thinking about it when I woke up. That's how great this movie is! It's one of those movies that will have people talking for days and days! OK, well, the first few minutes of the film really pulled me in. I was intrigued. VERY intrigued.

However, there came a point when the movie did lose its steam. It's when Deborah Kara Unger comes in. Now, I would've just preferred her to not be part of this movie or, better yet, not come as early into the film because I liked Sean Penn playing the game by himself and not with a partner. That's just me, though.

But overall, I loved the plot for the film and it did keep me guessing from beginning to end. My mind was literally blank. I love the whole puzzle feeling from the film. It gives you one piece at a time until the ending where it puts all of the pieces together. It was really great to have seen this movie. It gives us an important lesson (but I'm not going to say a thing) and this thriller is just that unpredictable that you can't believe it!",8
29 April 2007,"""The life is dream""","A Kafkaesque atmosphere and a very good acting. Exploration of illusions, desires and the human limits. Illustration of old Calderon de la Barca ""The life is dream"". Analys of truth and memories, connection between facts and shadows of fear, fragility of truth and social statute, ambiguous contact with the other and traumas. A great film for tension, script and a brilliant Michael Douglas falling in a different world. Only problem- the end. The happy-end as ordinary solution but a real error in this case. A joke after a beautiful story for save the appearances. After the father's gesture, the party. A moral solution for a surrealistic show. And yet, a subtle pledge for search of existence's sense and for understand the world as a huge puzzle in which every piece is projection of a secret desire.

8 September 2007,One of Fincher's best,"This film is exceptionally one of David Fincher's best film. I enjoyed Fight Club, Se7en, and Panic Room (for the script). This should be considered one of his trademark film. You either like it or something else. The shots and the score all fit to the necessary atmosphere and script. Michael Douglas once again give a great portrayal of a man tortured mentally. The gradually rising tensity and some major twist leave the audience blank, for they know not what is going to happen. And we all love him for it. You are not there only to spy on the party. You are IN the party. And the family-video title sequence give me one of the best first impression I haven't seen in a long time.

This is a really good film from one of the finest director of our time. 9/10.

5 August 2018,Frustrating suspense thriller with an unsatisfactory ending,"I've never been a fan of overly complex thrillers with plots that are deliberately convoluted and confusing. I can never seem to get into them and they usually end up being more frustrating than entertaining. 'The Game' falls directly into that category, and is particularly unrewarding given the awful plot twist and horrific ending, which makes the rest of the film feel like an even bigger waste of time.

On the surface, 'The Game' looks great. It's well made, the cinematography is top notch, and Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are excellent in their roles. While for these reasons it's a perfectly watchable film, the convoluted and unrewarding storyline, along with the unsatisfactory plot twist at the end, make 'The Game' a difficult film to like. It's clear that it wants to be a sophisticated and intelligent thriller, but ultimately it's too smart for its own good.

25 March 1999,Worst Game Ever,"Wow, I haven't seen a movie this bad since ""Sliver"". Like this other ""suspense thriller"", the actors do a good job, and you can't even blame the director entirely. The concept is interesting but the script falls a mile short, forcing the audience to let its intelligence to be insulted for 2 hours.

There are so many mistakes and implausibilities in the movie, I'm sure I didn't even notice them all. But the most obvious: the timing of all of Douglas' encounters, the inability of the cops to do anything, Douglas' constant stupidity, and the fact that Douglas could have easily been killed on a few occasions.

Even the ending is very Sliver-ish, because they backed themselves into a corner. Not to ruin the ending for anyone, but there are only 2 possible endings, and so both are predictable - is everything real or is everything just a game? Does the audience care?? I say no. Because either way it is completely unbelievable.

I highly recommend that you avoid this movie if you have half a brain, unless you want to see how NOT to make a suspense movie. If you want to see a good suspense movie see The Firm or 12 Monkeys, two movies that are far less painful than this one. I am off to smash my rented copy of this movie now.",5

28 February 2010,Great film!,"In my opinion, ""The Game"" is an absolutely breathtaking film and a great mix between an innovative concept and huge acting. It mixes the gripping ideas of producer David Fincher with the representation of a great main character by Michael Douglas.

The plot is based on a memorable mix between realistic and unrealistic features. The most exciting part of the story is probably the ending, when Nicholas realizes that the whole story was just a try from his brother to make him more natural and change his type of a greedy businessman. The superb acting strengthen this effect. The perspectives of the cameras are well-chosen, too.

So if you want to see a film with an extraordinary story about an egocentric businessman receiving a special birthday present from his brother, you should definitely watch this film

2 June 2021,Is it a game or is it real? 6\10,"""The Game"" is a thrilling film that meets the criteria of suspense and drama, the movie is directed by David Fincher although it isn't his finest work nor his best known. The movie stars Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a billionaire who's life isn't as existing as it sounds. At one point he is given the opportunity to participate in a mysterious game, only is it really a game or is it reality?

The movie successfully manages to bring some tension at a few points during the film but it doesn't have a huge impact, neither when I saw the film I didn't feel I was going to be surprised by the ending, either it was only a game or it was a Hugh scheme to kill\hurt Nicholas. The performances by Douglas and Sean Penn were brilliant, if I'm correct this was Fincher's second film he directed after ""Seven"" so maybe the expectation was to big.

8 July 2018,Game on!,"What do you get when you blend the narrative structure of ""The Usual Suspects"" with Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances, and the moral universe of Anton Chekhov's short story ""The Bet""? You get this finely crafted thriller directed by David Fincher (Alien3 and Seven) and starring Michael Douglas (Falling Down, The American President).

Michael Douglas plays a wealthy investment broker who appears to have it all. For his 48th birthday, his younger brother (well-played by Sean Penn) gives him a gift designed for the man who has everything-a membership in a recreational services club that custom-designs experiences to meet the unique voids of each individual client (or so they say). The catch is that clients never know what's coming, and the line between real life and ""the game"" gets more and more blurred as the story unfolds.

The movie pushes credibility to the limits, and occasionally, beyond. But the story is engaging enough that I found myself restraining my disbelief until after the ride was over. One of the things that can make this an enjoyable movie-going experience is taking some friends along who like to probe deeper meanings.

""The Game"" works not only as an engaging thriller, but also as a moral parable, a social commentary on the hollowness of contemporary society, and a kind of philosophical riddle. Viktor Frankl has described the illness of modern humanity as noogenic neurosis-an existential vacuum in the soul-that leaves us longing for deeper meaning. While ""The Game"" does not offer profound solutions, it does provide an engaging story about the problem.",9

The acting by all of these actors is very good. Douglas, Penn, and Mueller-Stahl are really excellent in this film. I thought that they performed good. The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed very good. The music is good by Howard Shore. Good directing by David Fincher! The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn, Peter Donat, Carroll Baker, Ana Alexander, Armin Mueller-Stahl, the rest of the cast in the film, Mystery, Thrillers, Adventure, Action, Dramas, and interesting Afilms then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!

7 June 2010,Very enjoyable and underrated,"I loved this movie! This dark artistic film takes you on a ride with the character in a psychological game where the main character finds out more about himself. I let the movie take me wherever it wanted to go and I was thoroughly pleased. If you love psychology, you might like this film. The performances are astonishing. Characters aren't what you expect them to be, which is just what I love! Perhaps there could be touch up in a few areas, but I can't think of any at the moment.

Very artistic and astonishing. I love the suspense. I was left in awe of the twists and the turns. I love the complexity. I love the subtlety. Perhaps you should watch it and see for yourself? I would highly recommend it. Worth your time for sure.

13 March 2007,Fincher fan or not- see this movie,"Definitely worth a rent AT LEAST. Fincher's third movie stars Michael Douglas as the rich, cold and alone Nicholas Van Orton. His brother, Sean Penn, gets him a reality-life game from a company who specializes in creating different life games for different people based on their lives, history, likes and dislikes, etc. The object of the game: to figuare out what the object of the game is. Orton is very reluctant about the game, however you can tell he secretly is very intrigued by the idea. As you may guess and without revealing too much- things get out of hand very quickly and things are not what the seem. Michael Douglas is at the top of his game as well (pun intended). Personally, I find this to be one of his best movies he's ever made. All in all, this one is a must for thriller fans, Fincher fans, Douglas fans, and just about everyone else too. 8/10

3 May 2017,The Game,"David Fincher is a highly celebrated modern director responsible for a few modern-day classics, as well as the 1997 film, The Game. Fincher is one that I have struggled with. Some of his films make it easy to see their greatness, while others seem overrated, to me. The Game starring Michael Douglas as a rich investment banker looking for a break from his life shows interest in a mysterious game his brother informs him about. A mystery folded within an exercise in personal revelation, The Game never quite delivers on either message it promises.

Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a wealthy investment banker living in San Fransisco who enjoys his time alone more than he enjoys crowding his life with an abundance of people. He has even become rather estranged from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn). When Conrad tells his brother about an unusual game he can play, then gives him a gift certificate to partake in the game for a birthday present, Nicholas is intrigued. Nicholas is constantly haunted by memories of his father's suicide, and these flashbacks have intensified the closer it gets to Nicholas's 48th birthday, as that was the year his father ended his life. Seeking a refuge from his life and the constant flashbacks, Nicholas begins to investigate taking part in the game. Almost immediately after his entry to the game, Nicholas endures trauma and troubles in every aspect of his life. His professional life, his personal life, and even his safety have all become uncertain as the lines between reality and the game become too vague to discern.

The Game presented a unique premise but perhaps was a bit too far- fetched. The elaborate measures one endures while taking part in the game, up to and including being abandoned for dead in Mexico yet unable to trace, beg for more than a suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience member. The film also has a serious pacing problem. Tightening up the narrative and reducing the run time by about 30 minutes would have been a great benefit to the audience. The film really starts to slog about just after the halfway point, becoming easy for one to lose both interest and intrigue. I read a reading of the film that presents it as a modern-day retelling of A Christmas Carol. I have difficulties with this reading because there is not enough establishment of Douglas's character as a bad person before he starts playing the game. Scrooge, in A Christmas Carol, is quite obviously a curmudgeonly fellow, obsessed with profits and his own gain. Douglas's Nicholas, however, comes off as a man successful in his field who appears broken by the looming memories of his father's death. Without a clear identity of Douglas as a man we are supposed to dislike due to his business practices, it's difficult to watch his livelihood taken away from him due to a sick game. I came off disliking the seemingly heroic Conrad than I ever disliked Nicholas. The Game falters on its premise and suffers from too little establishment of what is apparently supposed to be an unlikeable character, which is a unique problem in a film in which pacing is such a slog.",4

18 May 2002,"Boring, to say the least.","Sean Penn and Michael Douglas are two actors, who's work I had until this film came out, found always watchable, regardless of plot or role. However, 'The Game' changed all this for me as from the very moment the opening titles rolled it became apparent that the only game I would be playing would be one of endurance. Weighing in at a hefty 128mins this was not going to be easy. One bad plot twist followed another as the director tried to squeeze the last drop of blood from a farcical concept and very shaky premiss. The worst seemed to be the never-ending ending. The story was concluded time after time only for a new even weaker plot twist to surface. Finally when the film did end the final scene was fittingly as unsatisfying as the rest of the film.

I can truly say I have never regretted not walking out of a film as much as this one in my whole life, two hours of watching paint dry would have been a much more fulfilling and worthwhile experience.

28 June 2019,Fun Thriller,"The overarching plot is quite unique, but intricacies of the plot are rather clunky and not believable. The ending does not justify the plot throughout. Plainly stated, they try to trick and deceive you so much throughout the film that the ending doesn't make sense.

If you go along for the ride you begin to feel as the protagonist does. Manipulated. It leaves you feeling a unique kind of queasy and for that it is an emotionally effective film.

It keeps you hooked, and it gets confusing at times. You probably won't mind. Michael Douglass gives a great performance. The only downside I thought was the confusion at times. It works out at the end, though. Always seems to in a movie.

Intense, thrilling, and mostly fun.

29 September 2017,Fincher's best is an underrated gem,"The Game is an incredible ride. If it were a Twilight Zone episode, it would be the best Twilight Zone episode by far. I do not understand the negative reviews and if you're a student of cinema like me then you shouldn't understand them either. What Fincher was able to create here was pure and utter genius. The writing, the atmosphere, the dialogue, the score, the cinematography and the brilliant performances are as close to perfection as you can get. One of the complaints I've heard about The Game is that the movie isn't realistic and goes too far. Well, today we have technology that is far more impressive than anything seen in The Game. I came to realize long ago that the world is usually a lot more complex than we realize and with money and an endless amount of resources you can get some pretty amazing things done. That being said, the goal of the movie was never to be realistic. It was rather to create an exciting ride into the realm of cinematic magic, a world where reality and fiction dance together as elegantly as possible. That is what we saw here and it was done masterfully.

You know there is going to be a good ending or twist to complete it. That's where this film is massively let down. The twist is appalling and just daft, so many holes in the story.

It's a shame as it's well acted and could have been a good film.

The end makes it a disaster of a film.

3 December 2009,Is it real?? More than you know!,"I had no idea how good this movie was going to be when I first watched it on cable years ago. During my 1st viewing I had a hard time wondering if where the plot was going.This was a new type of story for me so it's safe to call it original in a field of films that just keep writing out the same plots over and over again. The writing was mature & serious too. Yes, a film without children, thank goodness.

I watched it for a 2nd & 3rd time. It was hard to find in the DVD stores but I found a copy. I was hoping for a sequel but it never happened. Good writing like there is in, ""The Game,"" is hard to find.

I've seen some of David Fincher's (director, ""The Game) films - his latest being ""Benjamin Button."" ""The Game"" is one of his best efforts.

If you like originality and getting psyched out this movie has it all. You may want to watch it again and again. Definitely for the DVD library.",8
24 June 2006,Fantastic,"This movie is absolutely wonderful. It's the best movie I've seen in months. Sure, the ending leaves you with a 'what the hell just happened' sort of feeling, but it's not irritating, as it sometimes can be. It's a lot of fun to watch and the plot twists are in no way predictable. Even when I thought the movie was once again in reality, it wasn't. The movie totally turned into a case of 'where does the game begin and where does it end?'. I really enjoyed trying to figure out what the game was, who was in it, and why the people at CRS were so relentless. Because if the people at CRS (spoiler, I suppose) were only trying to screw Nicholas Van Orton over, why didn't they just stop once they made him look crazy and got control of all aspects of his life? Truly a magnificent film. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.

7 November 2018,Wow. Simply Wow,"Could not keep my eyes from the screen, even when changing clothes in another room or drinking.

Plot was set up amazingly, as many twists and turns as an austrian road. I normally predict where a story is going and what characters are really after but I was always one step behind in this movie.

Im sure there was lots I missed and would see only on second watching.

Acting,stunts,story,cinematography was all amazing.

Currently rated 9 because Im still a little hyped but if I feel the same way I will change to 10.

What I like best about the movie are all the little lessons that are sprinkled throughout without laying it on thick, such as the banker needing to take his life a little less seriously and break bread with his family.

Great job!!!! WOULD RECOMMEND!!!!",9
26 November 2019,An elaborate noir-inspired game by Fincher,"David Fincher's third feature film ""The Game"" (1997), written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, is an excellent psychological film exploring risk behavior, Explorers through brilliant direction and writing.

We follow Nicholas Van Orton, portrayed by Michael Douglas, a wealthy banker living in San Fransisco, who is given an invitation by his brother to a mysterious company selling a concept referred to as a game.

Fincher brilliantly and effectively stages the premise of the film, accompanied by Howard Shore's noir-inspired score as well as flashbacks to his father's suicide from when Orton was a young boy - a striking introduction.

Michael Douglas gives a convincing and cynical performance - very fitting to the film's atmosphere.

All in all, an interesting and bold thriller.",8

30 May 2018,I want to join The Game once in my life time,"This is the first time ever I've been blown alway by the talent behind the movie The Game that is director David Fincher for directing such an awesome crime thriller that i can't even predict anything so the final twist hit me hard and let me speechless for a moment.Everyone performance is fantastic and above all is Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger.It sad that when you finish The Game the replay value of the movie is very small cause you already know all twist and turn so I can't really find myself watching The Game again with anyone

2 November 2021,catharsis,"A masterpiece thriller. A terrific plot, and a finale that takes and deceives the viewer.

The film asks the question of what needs to be done to break out of the routine and rethink life.

The original picture, after which directors like James Wan began to make their own versions of the ""Game"".

Facts such as: Acting, feverish narration, crazy plot twists, thoughts constantly spinning in my head when watching and after, makes watching this movie unforgettable.

Even though my expectations were very high, the tape more than met them.

No wonder this movie is the standard of thrillers, you are in the wildest tension, it is impossible to break away. After watching it, I was impressed for a few more hours.

In addition to the first layer of semantic load, I found the second. It lies in another question, why do people hate their birthdays. This topic is raised in the first half of the film. In the second half, she just sinks. Why do I think there is such a meaning? Firstly, the reaction of the main character to congratulations from colleagues, acquaintances is zero. It is literally written on his face that he is infuriated by all this attention of people who don't care about him. Secondly, the emotional callousness and uniformity of all days preserved the main character even more.

Conclusion: A very good movie. I highly recommend it for viewing.

8.0.",8
25 November 2009,One of the best movies of all time in spite of some negative criticisms,"The plot of the movie is one of the most mysterious and surprising ones so far and I think about it, the recently made movies with plot twists such as The Machinist is nothing in comparison with The Game. The plot may be summarized as for his birthday gift by his brother, a businessman is engaged in an organization that arranges games in exchange for money, but soon he realizes that it is not a game. The Game is an underrated movie which in contrast, according to some audiences overrated. Besides very smart plot, the things make the movie an excellent masterpiece are Fincher's story telling, music causes mystery, atmosphere and Michael Douglas. I believe that it is an easy role may be, but Douglas seems the best choice for this role. After watching the final scene, every detail, every dialog, every event require re-interpreting. One of the best twists so far. Even just the relationship between Nicholas and Christine makes the movie enigmatic. Is Christine a femme fatale who then decides to help him? Is she a femme fatale pretends to be a good girl? or Is she a bait? Another point, Fincher reflects Van Orton's nightmarish situation perfectly also with a very stylish direction. Unbelievably, some people say that it is a plain story, the movie's theme is know the value of life. This is just an interpretation and no need to say that it is much more than that. Let's remember It's a Wonderful Life. The Game and that film are extremely different from each other, but the thing I try to say is that if we look from this point of view, the movie's theme is the same, know the value of life, in spite of the challenges, don't give up etc. but does this simple theme make the movie weak? It's a Wonderful Life is a great movie. Therefore, as said, the very consistent script, the plot, Fincher's story telling and direction, the very successful atmosphere, music and Douglas's persona make the film great and Sean Penn is our bonus. I like the final and cannot see any wrong or simple point. When I watched it first in 1997, the reaction in the final made me seriously bothered, that's why a lot of people dislike the movie, they say it ruins the movie, but I don't see it as a flaw or call it a bad ending, if you ask me, it was a bit frustrating. It is just like if I was him, I would not do what he does. The Game is one of the movies of my life.",10
12 July 2021,Fincher's Vitruvian Man,"The Game is not David Fincher's best work, but that's a compliment when you've also lead the way one films like Flight Club (His Mona Lisa) and Se7en (His The Last Supper). While this movie definitely carry's the tones of a Fincher film, it was oddly distinct and I think will continue to help it age well in the minds of those who have watched it.

Again, this is not Fincher's best work but when your 3rd best piece is something that can have an audience 20+ years later sitting on the edge of their seat second guessing their own intuition... you've done well.

30 December 2000,glad to see people are thinking on their own a bit,"I was surprised, after reading some of the comments, how much most everybody thought this movie through when all the confusion was over. It made me happy to think that a lot of people are still capable of absorbing material without blindly accepting it. We all aren't completely mindless fools yet. This is somewhat encouraging, keeping in mind how American education (among others) has been steadily dumbing down over the years. I read that the average vocabulary of a 14 year old has decreased by something like 4 times from what it was about 50 years ago. Anyway about the movie....it was quite suspenseful to my 16 year old mind which hasn't seen many of the movies of the past with similar approaches and tricks. I liked all the little plot twists and the acting was excellent. However, in my opinion, this was a movie, that one can pick apart in terms of realness and believeablility, what with all the simultaneous occurances and split second decisions that somehow coincide with something else that is suppose to happen. Basically, in real life the whole concept behind ""the game"" would be a very hard one to achieve......too many things could go wrong. This doesn't bother me too much though because I have always thought that movies' main purposes are to entertain and provoke thought, and THE GAME reached great success in both of these areas.

If anyone reading this has totally contrasting views to what I said I would really like to hear them so email me. I too am a dumb youth of America and need to be enlightened.",9

24 August 2021,Mediocre and felt like it was rushed,"The Game had a unique story to it, and had a lot of potential going for it. A lot of the events through it felt repetitive as though the film was trying too hard to make a twist happen. I found the ending predictable and felt rushed.

Overall, 6/10.

11 April 2021,Terrific thriller,"So many twists and turns, everytime I thought I had it all figured out, another surprise came at me. It does start out a bit slow, but eventually the flow of events will speed up.

The casting of Michael Fouglas and Sean Penn was perfect, they both brought what could be expected. One of my favourite performances of Michael Douglas.

7 May 2023,One of the best,"I have no idea how this movie flew under my radar and never got my attention this whole time since I'm a big thriller fan and have watched hella movies especially of the specific genre but it doesn't get the recognition it deserves.

For me at least not once through the whole movie did I get bored, it's tense and it can fasho keep you on the seat long enough to make you wonder how its going to end.

I loved the plot twist right after the first plot twist at the end lol. I know it's an old movie and most people prolly have watched it already but if you haven't give it a try it's not going to dissapoint.

5 September 2010,"Great Film, Buy it Don't Rent It","I suppose ""The Game"" was the first film I ever saw that had a twist ending that was actually twisted. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a great movie, sure, but the ending wasn't twisted. A shocker, yes, but not twisted. Even the killer from ""Se7en"", Fincher's masterpiece, wasn't a twist ending. A twist, yes, a surprise, hell yes, but a twist ending? No.

With Michael Douglas and Sean Penn headlining a cast that also includes James Rebhorn and Armin Muehler Stahl, you wouldn't expect a twist at all. No, with these actors you'd probably expect maybe a nice little thriller or maybe even a comedy of sorts, and that's why ""The Game"" is such a masterful film. These actors are so completely taken out of their element it's scary.

Douglas is Nicolas Van Orton, a rich man who's unhappiness in life has been noticed by his brother, the care-free, James Dean-ish Conrad Van Orton. Conrad gives an unthanking Nicolas a card for CRS, a company that will make Nicolas' life better. And so begins a long, perilous, and unimaginably entertaining psycholgical mind game where Nicolas' life doesn't just turn upside down, it turns inside out.

I loved ""Se7en"", so I had high hopes for ""The Game"" and this film didn't at all disappoint. In fact it raised the bar so much that I've made a point to see every Fincher film since. (Fight Club and Zodiac are also fantastic films) The camera-work is awesome, with each scene having and holding a growing sense of claustrophobia.

The acting is just superb. I don't think Michael Douglas is able to turn in a bad role. He's just as good in this as he was in ""Wall Street"", and will be when ""Wall Street 2"" comes out this month. Penn is also very good, showing his stripes as the free-wheeling brother. Deborah Unger is beautiful and underrated as an actress, I wish she'd be in more movies like this. Stahl and Rebhorn show why they are also some of Hollywood's most underrated blood.

To sum it up, ""FANTASTIC MOVIE."" The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the film as a whole, awesome. The ending absolutely blew me away. Don't just rent this one, buy it, because you'll want to watch it again and again.",10
22 September 1998,Stylish but flawed,"Stylishly directed by David Fincher in a very convincing modern-day film noir mode. Plot is genuinely intriguing but takes a long time to gain any momentum at all. Ending is a real let-down particularly when an obvious window was there for a more intriguing and intelligent conclusion, although I suspect that popular tastes are the cause of this problem. Penn and Unger are good but Douglas as the lead character gives a rather lackluster performance that could easily have been put together from bytes from his other films.

The storyline is brilliant and the ending will blow you away. I was completely stunned. Even though it makes you think the writers have a sick sense of humor, this is one of the more original movies I've seen in a while. Definitely a must-see.

1 January 2000,This is supposed to be believable?,"The best description I heard of this movie once was that it is a complete ""crock"". I can't think of a description I could agree with more. While the movie has good production values and a good cast, the plot is totally unbelievable. I can't imagine anyone wanting to do what happens in this movie or having the technical means to do it even if they *did* want to. If this movie were listed in the category of ""fantasy"" it might have had a chance. As a drama however, it is a complete farce. Save your time and money.

27 May 2008,Michael & Fincher... Great Combo,"I saw this one in theaters opening weekend on a first date. I don't really remember the dinner before the movie(or my dates name), but won't ever forget the ""wow"" feeling I had at the climax of this film. It was like nothing I had ever experienced at the movies. Michael Douglas is solid; Penn, an excellent support. The cinematography, plot, dialogue, all were on point and followed a consistency not equaled even rarely.

In my opinion, this was Fincher's greatest work, followed closely by Se7en, for you cynics. A true masterpiece. Douglas fans(or foes), a must see.

7 March 2018,An intelligent mind-game of a thriller.,"'The Game (1997)' is all about the moment, being placed in the shoes of the protagonist and doubting everything you see just as he does, and it works remarkably well considering it has more twists and turns than a country lane. Its various reveals always work because it has the remarkable ability to predict exactly what its audience is thinking and to be two steps ahead of them even when they think they are two steps ahead of it, and it is this underlying intelligence that prevents the flick from feeling cheap or frustrating in any way other than one which would enhance our connection with the core character and strap us in for a mind-game almost like no other. 7/10

3 February 2023,Conned Really Smartly,"Just when you think Michael Douglas has been put through the mill in some of his previous movie roles, David Fincher's stylish, stylised thriller puts him on the rack, through the wringer and generally hangs him out to dry, all at once.

Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, an almost 48 year-old investment banker working out of San Francisco. Mega-rich, über-cool and ruthless, we've already seen from the opening titles however that he has considerable psychological baggage, having watched his father kill himself by jumping off a roof when he himself was only a boy. Now he has a failed marriage and stays alone in his mansion, living for the next deal. So he meets up on his birthday with his feckless, tearaway kid brother Conrad or Connie as he calls him, (I guess the clue in the name was right there in plain sight!), played by Sean Penn who gives him the mysterious gift of a card bearing the name C. R. S. Entitling him to participate in an unexplained game which Conrad tells him will change his life.

Nicholas succumbs to his curiosity, probably expecting nothing more than a random crowd-mob experience and applies to take part which means undergoing rigorous physical and mental tests but when he finds out he's failed the procedure, his ego slightly damaged, he nonetheless returns to his normal life. Or so he thinks...

From there poor old Nick is maneuvered into situations ever more confusing, complex and dangerous, as he's drawn deeper and deeper into the maelstrom. We see him lose his wealth, status and finally his very sanity. Is this all still a game but even if it is, has it somehow spiralled out of control spilling into real-life, driving him, seemingly to his breaking point? Well, you'll just have to watch to the end to see...

Considering what the banking fraternity did to the markets in 2008, I was almost happy to see one of their number taken down and apart so dramatically. There are plenty of plot-jumps and plot-holes along the way as one unbelievable situation succeeds another but it's all executed so skilfully by both Fincher and Douglas that I was willing to overlook these and even the pat ending, where I was expecting a twist to the twist.

Next time though, I'm sure Mr Van Orton would prefer a plain old jumper of the woollen variety rather the other type he receives here.",7

1 January 2019,implausible,"Many people reviewed this as implausible and gave it a 1.

I judge it implausible and deserving of an 8.

Let us take for example science fiction movies that involve time travel. Utterly implausible because they violate laws of physics discovered by Einstein.

So does that mean all movies involving time travel deserve a 1 rating? Not in my opinion.

The question to me is: Could this particular story have been done in a more plausible manner? Without a lot of plot holes? In my opinion, no.

Was it a hell of a story? You bet it was. And the plot holes were unavoidable. So they can't be held against it.",8
4 June 2020,Stunning,"One of Michael Douglas' best performances. Halfway through the movie, you can't differentiate between what's real and what's not. Here I am watching it for the first time in 2020, and kicking myself for not seeing it before. Just a brilliant example of a mystery thriller. Keeps you on the edge of the seat. Highly recommended.

28 October 2011,Wow,"That's all I can say: Wow. What a movie. This is a psychological thriller, in every sense of the meaning. Thankfully, I knew what I was going in for, so when I watched it, I enjoyed it. Great premise, great script, great acting, great behind-the-scenes work; I could go all day on this one.

Michael Douglas has hit a home run here, ladies and gentlemen. He is flawless. Sean Penn is great as well, despite the limited screen time that he is given. Everyone else did good as well, but it is really Douglas' character that you feel for the most, which is obviously a good thing since he is the title character.

All in all: a phenomenal film. If you like watching psychological thrillers, go see this movie. However, if you leave your mind at the door, you will be way too confused when it comes to seeing this movie. This is a thinking movie. That being said, it was very well played out, and everyone involved in this film should be proud of themselves. 10/10 for me.

30 August 1998,"Good beginning and ending, too long a middle","THE GAME starts out so well that it's a shame it bogs down in the middle. But the ending more than makes up for it. At two hours and eight minutes it runs way, way too long. It needs at least half an hour cut out of it. If fact, more than an hour and a half could be cut and it could be run as the most expensive episode ever of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

But, as I said, it starts well. Nicholas is an investment banker, played by Michael Douglas with his WALL STREET characterization and wardrobe intact. Nicholas makes money. Nicholas has money. Nicholas wants more money. He lives alone in a huge house in San Francisco, presumably spending his evenings alone counting his money.

Of course, his life is going to change. That's the film's whole thesis. Instead of changing in an unusual way, though, what happens blends elements of SECRET CINEMA (and this year's THE TRUMAN SHOW), THE WIZARD OF OZ, and A CHRISTMAS CAROL into a meatloaf of a movie made with leftover ingredients.

Nicholas's birthday comes along, and he gets together for dinner with his brother Conrad (Sean Penn). Conrad is the loose cannon of the family. In and out of trouble, in and out of rehab. He and Nicholas were both traumatized by their father's suicide many years ago, an event which will be strangely echoed in elements of THE GAME's most excellent climax.

Conrad has a gift for Nicholas: a gift certificate for a once in a lifetime experience. Nicholas submits to a battery of psychological and physical tests, and soon the game begins in earnest.

Driving home one night, Nicholas finds a wooden clown in the driveway. He carries the clown into the house, and later finds an important key in the clown's mouth. While Nicholas watches the news on tv, reporter Daniel Schorr talks to Nicholas, calling him by name and alerting him to at least one hidden tv camera and microphone in the room. Before long paranoia is building in Nicholas's mind as the events become more and more bizarre; there are signifigant questions about what is real and what is paranoid fantasy. And there's a beautiful woman named Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) who changes from ally to enemy as many times as Eva Marie Saint did in NORTH BY NORTHWEST.

From here on the movie is a series of Chinese boxes, with plot revelations coming at ten minute intervals just like subway trains- and with the same predictability. A big theme of the story is that the bad guys have figured Nicholas's mind out so well that they can predict his every move, and his every move gets him trapped deeper and deeper. That same element of predictability adversely impacts the movies seemingly endless second act.

Nicholas is told that the game can be stopped at any time he wants, but Conrad confirms that it can't. There's a strange conversation with Conrad in which I'd swear that about ten seconds of dialog is played twice, which gives the scene the feel of a dream, but it isn't.

Nicholas starts out with a life of luxury and comfort; the opening scene of the third act finds him having to hitch-hike from Mexico to San Francisco, and plead with patrons in a roadside diner to give him a ride.

After making a false start with the third film in the ALIEN series, director David Fincher came back like a champ with SE7EN, which I felt was by far the best film to come out that year. THE GAME is a small step back for him, one from which he'll probably recover; if SE7EN hadn't blown me away so completely, I might be more forgiving of THE GAME. Counting uncredited ones, a total of at least four writers worked on this film. It shows.

Lord know he has a great cast to work with here. Sure, Michael Douglas's character is familiar to us in the first act as he plays the ruthless captain of industry, but as the story progresses we see a more human side of Nicholas. Sean Penn is always a welcome sight, even if he does have a rather small part here. And Deborah Kara Unger is a good actress who may well have great things ahead of her.

And that ending. Wow, that ending. It's not often that I'm shouting advice to onscreen characters when I watch a film on cable, but this time I was yelling ""Look out!"" and ""No! No! NO!!!"" loud enough that even though Michael Douglas couldn't hear me, people driving by our house probably did; hey, my family already thinks I'm strange, what the heck.

And a very important thing that I can assure readers of without spoiling anything: the story is NOT a dream nor is it a halucination brought on by any drug. I was braced for it to end with Nicholas sitting bolt upright in bed drenched with sweat mumbling about what a weird dream he'd had; I didn't like that plot device in INVADERS FROM MARS or any other movie except THE WIZARD OF OZ.

Parents' note: THE GAME's R rating is almost entirely for language. There's very little violence and no nudity or sex. The R rating is to trick teenagers into thinking they'll see more than they are going to. A skilled editor could (and should) have cut it to a PG in an afternoon.

On a scale of five, Pops gives THE GAME four birthday cakes.",
7 July 1999,lost the plot,"I like this director. He isn't afraid to take the mickey out of the audience. This movie is a comment on the gullibility of people, on how they will believe any old nonsense - and from the other reviews on this site, the writer and director judged the audience correctly. People were taken in and made to look like complete idiots.

Judging by the amount of people who were taken in, which is more than I would have guessed, means the bar has been raised in audiences' suspension of disbelief. It really is amazing how much inconsistency exists in this script. I really have to applaud people for managing to enjoy this, but like the minority out there, we can do without this fluff.

As a comment on how much you can take the pi** out of an audience without half of them knowing it, then this movie deserves 10/10. As a film, it requires you to suspend your disbelief beyond what is required.

18 July 2023,Mind Games to the Max - The Game,"Mr. Brancato and Mr. Ferris have written a wonderful screenplay, which will keep you guessing for over an hour whether or not the action and events are real or staged. There will be times when you think they are staged, and there will be times when you thing they are real. But you will not know for sure until the very climax of the film, which, of course, I will not reveal.

Micheal Douglas does a very credible job in the lead role as a boring, rich businessman who has very little going on in his personal life. He is pretty much a stuffed shirt. His brother, played by Sean Penn, gets him to play a very sophisticated game that is a real eye-opener in every sense of the word. You will have to see the film for yourself to judge whether it is real or just a ruse. Good luck with that decision.

27 December 2006,One Of Douglas's Top Films,"You want acting? An Intriguing plot? Watch this movie, everything about it is exceptional, and typical quality from one of the top directors working in Hollywood today! Douglas probably gives his best performance that I can remember... with Penn in a small role for him doing well as his brother.

What makes this film standout, is the fact of its originality, which in this day and age, is very very rare. Also, there's always the ongoing question? When and has the game even started? Near the end you can see Douglas losing it... desperation sets in and you genuinely feel the mans pain and distress... your hoping his find out what's going on...

All in all, exceptional, and I don't use that word often!

27 July 2012,"Far-fetched, Nonsense","This film has one saving grace that stopped me from giving it a 1 or 2 stars and thats that i was able to sit through it and the time didn't pass too slowly, for some people thats enough for them to rate a film 7 or 8 out of ten if its flashy enough but not me. With Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and an interesting concept I thought i'd be in for a decent watch but at the end I have to say it is way too contrived and unbelievable, it thinks its clever and symbolic but it isn't and this has the effect of being extremely annoying , the movie is ultimately pointless and i felt cheated im not a fan of Fincher at all extremely overrated, far from the genius he is billed by the public and media. I don't want to spoil the film but if anyone gave me that birthday present i would at the very least break their nose, the basic plot is that Michael Douglas, an extremely rich successful buisinessman clearly lonely and depressed is given a highly expensive gift which is a kind of ""personalized reality game"" for his birthday from his moronic brother Sean Penn, to enjoy this film you would have to suspend your disbelief to infantile levels which is OK for some films but this makes pathetic attempts at realism, I don't want to go into specifics as it's exausting those that have seen the film know what im talking about, I think it could have been much better if they had gone down the route that the film twisted away from but i predicted extremely early that it wouldn't ultimtely the film is very hollow and idiotic, sorry to those who thought it was a work of genius with a profound message. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",4

11 December 2014,One of David Fincher's weakest,"Granted, I haven't seen Panic Room or Alien 3 and so as of now I can only say it's one of his weakest, but from what I've seen of him, this is definitely his weakest and not up to his usual standard. It has an intriguing premise that besides a great first scene of ""the game"" being played, it goes nowhere with. It could've really been interesting in setting up certain scenes and scenarios, but it really didn't do much. Even Michael Douglas looks completely out of his element, looks bored or maybe that's just what he usually does with films like this. Either way, no a good performance. Yeah, not all that recommended and really not awful but not very good.

31 August 2018,A stylish thriller that has a stamp of authority of Fincher,"The game is a stylish thriller based on a mysterious game played by younger brother Sean Penn on the lead and elder brother Michael Douglas. Douglas is in top form and this was at the end of his run as leading man as the late 90s dawned but the film is a David Fincher signature. The cinematography, stylish narrative and Fincher's crisp direction make this a winner. Although there are certain plotholes-and they emerge the more you think of the film- this film is a ride you won't regret watching.

8 April 2014,Manages To Entertain. ♦ 60%,"It took 15 minutes for the plot to save itself from losing me and while it was at it, it used all its resources which could have been used elsewhere.

The previous sentence you just read is how you will feel like when you watch the movie: bit confusing. Michael Douglas is fantastic as the protagonist and even the plot looks good, at first. The climax was just lowbrow and maybe 2-3 hair raising. That's it.

Following the story of an affluent businessman, it talks about a game his brother asks him to play & finds himself ending up in the wrong places. The journey is entertaining per se. And the audience are in a state of wanting for more. Just then, you are shown the climax & the pieces start falling into puzzle. Yes, it does convery a message or prove a point, but a mild conclusion is just not what I was expecting & it played against the effect it had so wonderfully tailored in my mind. Performances are brilliant and I loved the cast.

While it was a lukewarm story, I liked the direction & music.

BOTTOM LINE: Give it a try.

Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",6

21 March 2022,"Gripping, David Fincher never disappoints!!","The Game is a true David Fincher classic. It keeps you bound to the edge of your seat till the very end! Michael Douglas is fabulous but the direction and screenplay are what steal the show.

The end is in a way anti-climatic but at the same time so surreal it leaves the viewer unsettled. Personally I would pity if this were to happen to anyone in real life.

The mental wreckage such a game causes is unfathomable but like Fight Club the essence here is stripping a person of what they cherish and value the most and then seeing the result. It always changes the person.

19 January 2003,This is SOOOO fake,"This movie is SO fake. Even Tom and Jerry gags seem more believable than the ones in this movie. Over-complicated and over-elaborated script with no moral in the final. I hate this kind of movie. Many movies where Michael Douglas plays are very elaborated but this one it's just too much for my taste.

5 April 2008,What a thriller should be.,"The first act of The Game (the first 30min) were immaculate. The plot set-up was perfect, characterisation was sublime, it was a textbook screenplay. And from this moment on, I was hooked. The deviation from normality following this immensely realistic opening created an amazing contrast that set the tone of the film.

The plot twists come and go, and you never really know what is going to happen - the guessing game is expertly crafted both by Fincher in his direction, as well as John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris in their screenplay.

Michael Douglas was faced with the task of holding this film upon his shoulders, as it was essentially a one-man show, and he was amazing. His fraying emotions heightened his downward spiral and altered viewer perceptions of the character as a result. Sean Penn was very good as Conrad, the brother, as is Deborah Kara Unger, as the ever mysterious Christine.

Fincher's direction only cements his position as one of the greatest directors of modern day (our generation, if you will). Along with Se7en and Fight Club, his films are cult legends and The Game doesn't let you down one bit.",8
24 May 2020,One of the most underrated movie. Better then my expectations,"The Game is a mystery thriller movie directed by David Fincher and stars Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger and late James Rebhorn in the leads.

The movie is based on an arrogant investment banker who receives a gift from his brother which turns his life upside down as trouble starts mounting in his life.

To be honest I was amazed after seeing the movie as I didn't have much expectations from the movie but the movie is surprisingly good.

The characters are explained beautifully. Acting is great and screenplay is gripping. The movie gets little slow in between and starts to look predictable but picks up very well with another stunning twist.

The movie surprises you on many aspects and is a decent movie to watch. A nice entertainer.",9
18 September 1998,Emazing movie!,"You must watch this movie! The plot is brilliant, the ending is amazing: Every time you think it's the end, it isn't.

17 June 2009,"""The Game"" is only for our amusement, the purest of thrillers","The mere title ""The Game"" suggests a sort of fabrication for our entertainment, and that is precisely what this film does. From the first cue to the final fade out, ""The Game"" is created for the sole purpose of giving its plot-sniffing audience something to mull over and over again amidst a series of 180-degree twists and turns. It is the very pinpoint definition of the thriller genre. Other films mix thriller with drama or action/adventure, but ""The Game"" provides neither of these to any real extent and instead opts to be the finest example of exploiting an audience's love for the guessing game.

""The Game"" is entertaining. Michael Douglas gets all dressed up for us Gordon Gekko style again and tries to unravel a dangerous real life mystery that envelops him after agreeing to an unusual birthday present from his brother (Sean Penn). From the moment we hear about the game we're completely hooked on trying to figure out what it is. It's a film that knows it has us right in its grasp the entire time and it fully exploits this fact -- we will not stop watching until we have the answers.

The irony here is that this game is created for the person, in this case Douglas' character, and for the audience, this movie is tailored much the same way. That might seem clever, but unless the biggest ""try to figure it out"" puzzle is all you hope for in film -- no serious character development, resolved subplots, flawless logic -- then truth is ""The Game"" is a bit insulting.

Writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris show a serious lack of respect for their audience. Sure, some people who watch this movie will forgive their sins because excessive plot twists excite them more than anything in cinema, but many watchers will feel insulted. Without getting into spoiler detail, ""The Game"" is riddled with plot holes and begs of you to suspend your disbelief out of sheer desire to figure out what's going on. Brancato and Ferris expect us to neglect our interest in the film's characters and in meaningful storytelling for some fancy plot writing. They underestimate us. They only haphazardly answer all the questions raised in the film, thinking we'll be happy if we just learn the truth behind it all.

Few films will hold your attention and curiosity from start to finish like ""The Game,"" but any hope that there's more in it for you than amusement would be best discarded before viewing. This is a thriller movie and everyone making it, even the excellent director David Fincher (""Se7en""), knows it.",6
10 October 2001,Fincher's Best! An absolute masterpiece!,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score.

22 June 2022,People would have trust issues after watching this,"""You don't know anything about society, Maria; you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it""

Just finished the film and my head is still spinning; like what had happened? What the heck was going on the whole time? I'm telling you guys, people would have trust issues after watching this!

Now jokes aside, it's good execution. After all, It's David Fincher, you expect nothing less. Albeit, I must admit, it's not one of his best works, not at all. This is one of his earliest directorial, hence, the imprecisions, and the inefficiencies are quite apparent here. Needless to say, the Screenplay too required some sophistication. But that doesn't in any way discredit the merits and the qualities Fincher has so flamboyantly demonstrated.

It's got the tension, it's got the thrill, and we also have a competent act from our main protagonist. And on top of all that, I couldn't take a proper guess where the narrative might lead me at any given moment. It kept me second-guessing up until the last minute. And I simply adore it when a movie does such mind-boggling stuff!",6
20 November 2022,Totally Stupid but...,"This is a film that is just like many of David Fincher films in that you have to suspend belief to enjoy 'The Game'. Yes, it is totally stupid but the direction and the characters keep you gripped. This is helped by Michael Douglas not going completely over the top as he is prone to do in many of his films and this is one where that might have been expected.

It is a film that keeps you guessing although you are often thinking it is getting more and more ludicrous.

A dumb but good film that can keep you entertained for the full two hours plus as long as you are not believe what's happening. .

17 March 2010,An exciting Hitcock-like yarn with principles,"Wealthy financier Nicholas Van gets drawn into a live-action game that consumes his life. Douglas perfectly portrays the characters journey, excellently written by John D. Brancato & Michael Ferris.

It's a psychological thriller packed with intrigue and suspense, a creepy clown and feeling of helplessness. Supporting actors are an array of familiar faces that include flawless performances from Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger and Armin Mueller-Stahl.

The flashback scenes of a younger Nicholas are captured beautifully by cinematographer Harris Savides and Howard Shore's score heightens the pivotal moments elegantly.

The Game is an exciting Hitcock-like yarn, with a principled message of wealth and youth, it's a fantastic thriller with amazing twists and turns from David Fincher. A must see.

23 August 2012,Fincher's Tremendous Knack for Suspense is Betrayed by a Cadre of Loose Screws,"Michael Douglas accepts an invitation to join a mysterious exclusive ""recreation activity"" at the insistence of his loser brother, and is then thoroughly terrorized by the game makers. It's a mile-a-minute barrel ride over the edge of a waterfall, with the audience left in the dark right alongside the protagonist. Young director David Fincher plays up the suspense gorgeously, but isn't quite able to compensate for a few inherent flaws with the premise. First and foremost is Douglas's leading part, a thoroughly unlikeable one-percenter who's such a Scrooge it's impossible to grow too invested in his fate. In a way it's cathartic to see him tormented by such a brutal series of twists and turns, especially in the afterglow of the Wall Street bailout, but the film goes out of its way to paint him as a sort of tragic hero. The plot's reckless yanks on the steering wheel, too, aren't all they're cracked up to be. Those constant swerves provide a great series of unpredictable thrills, but ultimately ring hollow when our suspension of disbelief is nudged too far beyond the coincidental. The entire closing sequence, in particular, is just so dependent on things happening in precisely the right place, at precisely the right time, in precisely the right way, that it left me questioning the validity of everything that had come before. A nice effort, and a strong-legged concept, that falls short in too many important areas to deserve high marks.",6
27 October 2011,Super entertaining,"This is definitely a roller-coaster film that never lets up, throwing nonstop intensity your way, continually remaining unpredictable and serving as the ultimate movie-going escapism. Michael Douglas turns in a likable performance as the perfect character to have so many things go wrong for him, and the dialogue and music craftily add to the suspense; the unnervingly high-pitched piano and deep string music never lets you forget this is a thriller. And the setup and progression of events are so enthralling that even if you don't approve of the outcome, getting there is all the fun. The idea is fascinating, and the way each of the events continues to draw Nick into a more and more complex fantasy is unique and endlessly amusing. His paranoia and uncertainty of what is happening interests us in the same way as if we were engaged in the game ourselves.

David Fincher has been making feature length movies since 1992 when he directed the third film in the Alien series. Since then, he's directed eight others, included GWTDT, and has another in pre-production. Fincher will turn 50 years old next year putting him in a generation of filmgoers who love movies like Easy Rider, The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Midnight Cowboy. These are great movies but they are for another generation, not necessarily the one that is targeted in films like Fight Club, or in The Social Network. Fincher has chosen to make movies for the generation following his own and he has captured the eyes of so many with a type of honesty and a type of gritty portrayal that we don't see from a lot of filmmakers targeting that same audience. The way Fincher's movie's look and a feel appeal more to that generation than any other is difficult to put into words but I'll do my best.",
20 November 2019,When Nicholas Van Orton becomes crazy.,"The game is very good suspense story.Nicholas von Orton ,a wealthy banker, bings to have serious problems,his bank accounts have been closed, he runs through the town looking for help, he meets a mysterious girl, he awakes in Mexico without his documents, a true nightmare.At the end we know what does happen with Nicholas Vn Orton (the explanation is in the title of the film). Maybe is one the best films of Michael Douglas, but also the performances of Deborah Kara Unger (Christine), James Rebhorn (Jim Feingold) and Sean Penn (Conrad Van Orton) are very good.

13 December 2019,One of the best performances of Michael Douglas,"The beginning of the ""The game"" is very stong. We see Michael Douglas as the self righteous, grumpy, egocentric (in short nasty) rich businessman Nicholas van Orton. Nobody likes this guy and that becomes extremely clear when he celebrates his 48th birthday all on his own in his big house watching CNN and eating a hamburger.

A day later he gets a present from his brother. It is a ticket to a tailor made game. From then on the film tells the biblical story of Job, learning a rich man humility (apart from the fact that Job was rich but good from the beginning). The life of the control freak Van Orton is turned upside down and he seems to lose all his money. It is no coincidence that on the film poster his face disintegrates in the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

Director Fincher tells the Job story in a spectacular way. The fact that a crime element or a crime possibility is always lurking on the background maintains the tension. As a viewer you forget that the story is highly unprobable. The organisation of the game seems capable of 100% predicting the reactions of Van Orton. It almost seems like the detective Dupin in the Edgar Allan Poe story ""The murders in the Rue Morgue"".",7

3 April 2009,One good movie,"I have seen many movies with many twists before. But none of them were like this one. With what I think is one of Michael Douglas' best performances, this movie takes you into a spiral of things that doesn't make much sense at first but are really clear in the end (I said that in the good way). The rest of the cast was great also. They helped a lot in setting that odd mood. The movie shows us a strange place filled with bizarre people.

Fincher's work is really great and is definitely worth watching. I can assure that 3 or 4 of his films will be included in your all time favorites. He does his job like nobody else can. Each film is unique, and different from what we are use to see. So give this and most of his movies a try.

30 December 2020,The Game - HHH Edition,"Disclaimer! I didn't pay proper attention to this at first. I put it on, got distracted with other things but did manage to keep up with it for the most part in the background. After finishing it, I wish I'd paid it more attention from the get go because this is a fascinating movie. Fischer is brilliant, Douglas is great. Easily the most amazing part of this to me though is the repercussions. So often we see movies with these insane plots and people that go through horrible experiences just to come out the other side better than they were before. Bloodied and bruised possibly, but improved. Not the Game. By the end of it you know that everyone involved with this will be carrying this with them for a long time. Therapists will get fancy cars and have this game to thank.

Again, wish I'd paid more attention to it but even being distracted for a serious chunk of this movie, I know quality when I see it. The ending alone gives it some serious points. Absolutely recommend this one. This is a buy for sure because after you finish it, you're gonna wanna watch it again. I know I do.",8

15 October 2000,C**p Rarely Seen...CRS,"This was one of the god-awlfulist films I've ever seen. I had to stay and watch it just to see just how really bad it was. A mish-mash of ""James Bondesque"" chases and scenarios seen a thousand times before in better films. It's a TOTAL RECALL ripoff with Michael Douglas in the Arnold role, 'cept ya never leave planet earth. Douglas is given a birthday present of an elaborate cat & mouse game courtesy of his little brother Sean Penn. Everybody is suspect, no one can be trusted...I guess this is supposed to keep us on the edge of our chairs for 2 hours. It only grates on your nerves. The writers of this film obviously say Bill Murray's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE and got the wise idea this would make an interesting vehicle. It's a vehicle alright...It'll drive ya right up a wall.

23 August 2005,"Good thriller, semi-Kafkaesque","A pretty good psychological thriller. Michael Douglas turns in his usual outstanding performance, but then, hey, he's got the genes. The plot is sort of an archetypal one of being manipulated and controlled by unseen forces. Sean Penn is quite good in a small part. Penn is a phenomenal actor, as much as it pains me to say so. Everyone knows his attachment to the political loony left, and this detracts some enjoyment from seeing him ply his craft. He, of course, has freedom of speech, and can say what he pleases, but in the old Hollywood days, the studio moguls kept their biggest stars away from political issues for just this sort of reason. But anyway, check out ""The Game"". It's worth a rental.

27 August 2022,A psychological thriller which requires you to suspend ALL credibility to enjoy the ride - until that awful ending.,"There are many movies where complete suspension of disbelief is required, and freely given. These are usually fantasies, sci-fi etc., but this film is not one of those. It is set in the ""normal"" world and is essentially about the protagonist (and you the audience) constantly having to guess what is reality and what is part of the Game. Unfortunately, the reality is so ridiculously far-fetched, it makes trying to differentiate it from the fakery completely redundant.

Nevertheless it does hold your attention and is entertaining enough, with Michael Douglas doing a good job in the lead role. That is, until the ending. One plot twist too far, where the implausibility dial is turned so high that even having agreed to suspend your disbelief, you just groan in dismay at what they expect you to cop.

6 December 2019,I really want to rate this movie higher,"The acting is great -- Douglas, especially, was amazing, and the action gradually, then frantically, picked up the pace to make this a true thriller. The premise was interesting, even though you could see both major twists coming a mile away (partly a function, sadly, of knowing that few movies would have the huevos to end this movie ten minutes earlier than it did end.) It had plenty going for it except...

...I haven't read any other reviews here, but I suspect my criticism can be found in many of them: the movie asks too much in terms of suspension of belief. Some of the events were guided. I get that. But there were so many possible ways things could go completely wrong, and all the personality tests in the world wouldn't be able to predict how a man will react to serious danger and stress for what I can only assume was the first time in his life. The extent of control needed to pull this off would require resources and (wo)manpower and contingency planning to put a serious dent into Nicholas' own $600 million dollar fortune. They couldn't just plan for a straightforward trip and have alternate plans on paper. They would have to allocate the same amount of time, money and resources to every possible contingency because an alternate plan is just a piece of paper if you don't actually have the resources in place to execute it if it becomes necessary. And this is the generous assessment of the suspension of disbelief issue. The harsher one is that they literally couldn't possible control the chaos enough to make the game feasible, let alone safe. All it takes is Douglas deciding to run in front of a car in panic or despair, or grabbing a random knife somewhere and slitting somebody's throat or deciding to board the wrong transportation in Mexico or throwing a certain blonde of the wrong side of the roof for things to go very wrong. I just couldn't buy that any organization could have that much power and control. We can't even get the government to pull off anything perfectly (people forget, for instance, that the carefully-planned and executed killing of Osama by the U.S. government still resulted in a crashed helicopter) and the government has more resources than any novelty company.

A couple other issues -- the organization was still breaking laws. Doing questionable things to a guy who signed a release? Sure, fine. Impersonating a police officer, reckless driving/endangerment, intercepting electronic communications? Transporting someone illegally over national borders? Felonies, and no release in the world will change that. And, in my personal opinion, Nicholas' rapid turnaround and ability to accept everything in good humor at the end just...seemed unlikely, especially for a high-strung man like Nicholas. Eventually coming to term with it, I can buy. Just not a 15 second transformation into a jolly good fellow. It's the most supremely optimistic Hollywood idea of how a person would react to a given situation I've seen in a good long while.

But, yeah, it was a fun watch anyway. I just can't gloss over the suspension of disbelief issue to rate the movie higher.",6
3 July 2008,Edge of your seat film captivates with stunts and scares,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score.

17 May 2023,As intriguing as it is frustrating,"Michael Douglas plays a wealthy investment banker whose dreary, uneventful life is turned upside down when his brother invites him to try a newfound game organized by a mysterious company. What does the game entail? And has it even started yet? David Fincher's much discussed and relatively hailed mystery-thriller is as intriguing as it is frustrating and manipulative. We follow Douglas around the city of San Francisco in what feels like a real-world computer game where you never know what the rules are or who you can trust. Fincher aims for a captivating, luxurious atmosphere filled with paranoia, but the story's unruly downward spiral is an exertion which the wildly elaborate and overly clever ending cannot quite balance - even if it does pose some interesting questions about appreciating life and contemplating death.

12 October 1999,Proposterous!,"I'm amazed to see this film has a high vote on IMDB. I thought this film was entirely proposterous. It starts out interesting, with Michael Douglas a lonely rich man with no sense of humour. He contacts CRS and the game starts. What follows is entirely unbelievable, very boring and did not surprise me in any way. The yawn count was high. Acting was OK, but the plot was not!

13 April 2023,"What is real and what isn't, and how do you know which is which?","Nicholas Van Orton (Douglas) is a very wealthy investment banker in San Francisco. Despite his status among the elite of California, Nick is quite solitary. He works hard, all the time, and has little interest in being social. The only people he seems to be remotely close to are his estranged brother Conrad and his housekeeper Ilsa. He also speaks to his ex-wife when she calls him on his birthday.

One such birthday, Nick receives a gift card from his brother Conrad, who asks his older brother the question ""what do you get for the man who has everything?"" Conrad tells Nick to call the number on the giftcard. That the company, callef Consumer Recreation Services, will make his life fun. So Nick calls the number, if nothing else to appease his brother.

Nick goes to the C. R. S. Headquarters there in San Francisco, where he discovers the service this company provides is called a game, specifically tailored for each participant. Kind of like a vacation that comes to you instead of you going to it. After you complete a series of tests, your game will begin at some point one day. C. R. S. Prides itself on having never had an unsatisfied customer.

So Nick completes all the required tests, and what happens next in his life is more than he could have ever bargained for.

If you are a fan of Fincher's work, or just a fan of great movies,, WATCH THIS ONE! To say that it is a mindbender is as much of an understatement as saying #46 is a buffoon.

It is a 7.8 rating at least. One of the best thrillers I've seen in some time (don't know how I'm just now seeing it 26 yrs later).",7

19 February 2000,Could Anyone Play it?,"Like most David Fincher movies, The Game has style and tension to spare. The problem I had with it was that it lay in the middle zone of fantasy; that is, it introduced elements of high fantasy into a low fantasy world. This odd combination prevented this viewer from achieving the needed level of suspension of disbelief. The movie starts with an excellent premise, but the storyline becomes increasingly implausible. Only a puppet could have been at all the right places at the right times, as Mike Douglas's character was. Problem is that this character has an Alpha Dog personality and could never have been manipulated in this way. Beyonf that, many elements of the game were so risky that it is unlikely the player would have lived through them.

Basically, what The Game plays on is the wide-spread belief and/or superstition that there is one or more highly organized group of people in this world that could take total control of your life. I simply couldn't buy this one.

24 September 2019,Better than just about Any Movie in the Last 20 Years,"Yes, it has plot holes, but it is entertaining, and that's all I can expect from a Movie.

Right now, the only better movie that comes to mind is ""Meet Joe Black"", which is also 20 years old.

4 January 1999,Totally engrossing!,"One of the most engaging films I have ever enjoyed. What a terrifying concept. A game of life and death, and not knowing what part you will play next. You get to a point where you sympathise totally with Van Orten, and you wonder how the hell he will get his life back. I loved it. Michael Douglas is getting better all the time. A little disappointed that Sean Penn wasn't in it for longer, though. A great follow up to Se7en from David Pincher. Unmissable.

2 December 2001,"original, but not touching","The plot is interesting, original, and cool. But actually, I don't feel anything emotionally touching me. Only through rational thinking, I can feel the serious meanings in the plot. It is people's careless thinking, that take other's lives as games. But think about it more carefully, isn't it a fable that tells people the reality? To think about the reality from another point of view. The reality is indeed like a game, only in real life, the games don't run this way, maybe not this fierce. And it's definitely possible in the US.

1 June 2010,The Ending Did Not Ruin The Film For Me,"Nicholas Van Orton is given a strange birthday gift from his brother. It's a card that tells him to go to this place called CRS, Consumer Recreation Services. They give Nicholas a chance to be a participant in a game. Things get a little too out of hand when the game itself becomes life threatening and Nicholas can't seem to stop it.

The Game is never really mentioned when talking about Fincher and his body of work, good or bad it gets left on the cutting room floor. I guess it's because the film is the middleman sort to speak. You have Se7en, and Fight Club, his two most popular and fan favourite films. Then you have Panic Room and Alien 3, considered lower calibre. Zodiac and Benjamin Button seem to be in a totally different class here, but The Game deserves to be mentioned because it is a well written, thought provoking thriller that manages to peel away at it's mysteries and never have the viewer bored. Even the film's ending, which many people seem to complain about, did not make me hate the film, or think the first 80 or so minutes were a waste.

The film looks and feels just like Fincher's others. It's cold, dark and unforgiving. He manages to craft his most suspenseful film to date and having Michael Douglass run around trying to solve the mystery helps the case. I'm a sucker for films full of mystery, that slowly but surely peel away at those mysteries to reveal the truth. A lot of crime films are like this, but The Game is something different. A bit more psychological, another reason why I liked it so much. Much like Memento, we are lost like the lead character. We know it's a game, he knows it's a game. But we, nor him, know exactly what the game is or what is happening next. We are trying to solve the same mysteries and Fincher makes us care about these things.

Complaints for the film are ones that would have me base the film is reality. To believe the stuff that happens in the film is for one to suspend a lot of belief. The film ends in a way that made me think whether I liked it or not. I would have preferred the first ending, as opposed to the second one, but the way they did it didn't ruin the film. I'm not sure how I will feel on repeated viewings, but as it stands, the thrills were still there and I still enjoyed them. I'm still left with some character motivation questions, some that I will not go into for the sake of spoiling things in the film.

Douglass, whom I usually hate, does a great job here. He is a jerk that slowly begins to unwind his sanity. His Gordon Gekko demeanor works here and yet we still root for his character. Sean Penn has a small role, one too small for me to really comment on and the supporting cast usually only have a scene or two to do anything. Deborah Kara Unger plays a good role in which we have to decide whether or not we trust her. She usually plays wackos.

The Game is something that might frustrate you with the ending, but that's what films are all about, getting some kind of emotional response. I'm not a fan of the last 3 or 4 minutes, to me it seemed to be tacked on by pressure of the studio and would not be something Fincher would normally do. But in the end, The Game is a worthy film if you are looking for a suspenseful thriller.",8

11 July 2019,It just doesn't make you care,"Let me begin by saying this is easily the worst and most dissapointing ""high-profile"" movie I've ever seen. It starts off well, with visually pleasing establishing shots of the world our protagonist lives in, but scene after scene it looks less organic and more off-putting. One could say it's a purposeful act that's meant to enhance the feeling of the inorganic nature of the realm we're observing. I'm not talking about that kind of ""off-putting"". It just looks ugly.

For most people, the glaring issue of the film lies in its hardly-believable plot, and the absurdity of the idea that Douglas' actions could be anticipated to the last detail, as well as the fact his character never really does something off-beat to disrupt the CRS. This can all be ignored if we view the film as mindless entertainment, but it takes itself far more seriously than that to let it get away with that excuse.

The atmosphere is described as dark, yet it feels comical, and the viewer is left unable to fully process the weight and severity of what's happening.

The really big issue this movie has it it fails to be everything it's supposed to. For it to be an entertaining movie of the mystery genre, the game Douglas is playing would have to be entertaining. It's not. We see him get overwhelmed with absurd situations, that fail to create tension and entice us, instead generating sheer frustration for the viewer. After a while it just makes you indifferent to his plight, and rather than craving resolution, you wish for it to end.

On the other hand, for the film to be a compelling mystery drama, there needs to exist character progression in order to justify layers upon layers of mystery. The protagonist is supposed to be shown experiencing growth and change based on the situations he finds himself in. Bluntly said, he's supposed to come out of the game being a better person, at least that's what the supposed point of the movie is. We never really get to see the effect of ""The game"", not even after the grand finale, and certainly not throughout the movie. We're just supposed to take it at face value that he's a different, better person now.

This is hard thing to accept, as it robs the audience of a certain kind of reward of growth and resolution.

To sum it up, The Game fails as entertainment, mystery and character study.",2

8 June 2016,"Hey, I'll Give This a Try","A few weeks ago a former student brought three boxes of VHS tapes to my classroom. She knew I like that format for its sturdiness, and I depend on VCRs to record movies, transferring them to disk if a movie is a keeper.

Most of the videos were films I already had or had already seen and didn't want, but I appreciated this young woman's thoughtfulness.

With that said, I found David Fincher's The Game, a movie that interested me when it first came out 19 years ago. I've seen so many crappy or mediocre films lately that I was hoping for a gem hidden in the box.

And I got one.

The best things about this psychological thriller are that, although it often brushes up against the absurd, it never gets saturated with silliness, and Michael Douglas is both infuriating and sympathetic as a heartless and driven money-mover who, after being given a very unusual birthday gift by his ne'er-do-well brother, Sean Penn, finds that the gift keeps on giving. Or taking, in this case.

For 128 minutes, I was able to jettison everything else, and become immersed in a story that was both fresh and fun. The Game is tightly plotted and well-acted, and only occasionally gets a bit boggy from aforementioned absurdities. Not enough to fuss about.

I thought I might be in for something above average with Douglas' character being confronted with that I-hate-clowns clown in his driveway, followed by being talked to directly by Daniel Schorr on TV.

It's a very trippy flick, with enough escapist power, twists and turns, and an understated moral to give an old movie-lover/movie- cynic a good solid entertainment.

Fire up the VHS to DVD transfer software!",7
22 November 2015,"The Game works good, but not as well as Fincher's previous film","Director David Fincher shocked audiences everywhere with his dark and grim 1995 thriller 'Se7en' starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Fincher continues his ingenious twists and suspense with this mind-bending thriller that is less compelling, but retains the wit and energy of his style of direction. Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orten, an arrogant San Francisco financial investor living a lonely life . On his 48th birthday, Orten receives a gift from his younger brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn). His gift happens to be a key to a strange company named Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Upon visiting this company, Orten begins experiencing some strange and unfamiliar occurrences that alternates his life. With the help of a local woman named Christine (played by Deborah Kara Unger), he must solve the mystery behind what he believes his reality and what he believes is an illusion.

Being a fan of David Fincher's works, this is a film that I had to see. It is not as dark and somber as his previous film 'Se7en' and is a bit more complex in terms of storytelling, but still brings his decent directing style to the screen. This film offers something a little different than rookie detectives investigating murders and facing down a vicious serial killer. Playing almost like a two-hour episode of Twilight Zone, the plot blossoms with frequent twists and turns, and soaring thrills. Those who struggle to follow along with the challenging storyline however, may be left deprived from the film's suspense. Yes, comprehending the storyline can be a bit of a challenge at times. Nonetheless, the story stays strong and diligent for the most of the time, nearly every scene is almost impossible to predict. The main characters played by Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger are pretty solid and the performances are praise-worthy. Sean Penn who plays the younger brother who though offers some decent acting, is a bit underused for the most part. The film sustains itself strongly until it reaches its climax. At that point, the film falls pretty flat.

Overall, The Game is a decent movie while it last. It definitely doesn't level up to the ranks of David Fincher's other movies and does suffer from a few flaws. However, it is still a satisfying picture and most of what it needs to do.",7
13 September 2020,Good,"Another psychological thriller. Nothing special here. Just another psychological thriller. That's all I could really say.

(spoiler alert (for some)) in the first 15 minutes they laid-out EXACTLY how the film would end. They tried to twist me off-course, but always I thought ""hmmm... my theory still holds because...

""still holds"" and then it ended EXACTLY as laid-out in the first 15 minutes - the only thing I did not predict was the (spoiler alert)... sky-light - seriously - that was the ONLY thing I did not predict after the first 15 minutes of the film.

27 December 2017,An unexpectedly real game,"Nicholas is a very wealthy banker, living his boring and unsurprising life without caring about anyone but himself. As a result, his brother Conrad invites him to join a very mysterious game which promises to change his life. Full of doubt but also intrigued by it, he fills in the forms and all begins with a call from the company which owned it. Soon after that, strange events start to occur making him doubt his sanity and subsequently his own circle of friends.

It is a very interesting plot centered on this ""game"", following closely every peril Nicholas has to face in order to come back to reality, if there even is one anymore. The mystery gets deeper after each event, fact which is a delight and it was almost impossible for me predict what was going to happen, so another plus here. Michael Douglas plays a great role throughout the movie expressing a great variety of emotions without breaking a sweat. Although the finale is a bit flat (but highly unexpected) and it had its inevitable boring moments, I strongly recommend this one as I enjoyed it a lot overall.",9

Some great set pieces, but the coincidences required for the plot contrivance to work are just a step too far to be able to take it seriously. It's entertaining enough, but it ain't great.

7 August 1998,Not a clever Game at all.,"You would have thought that a thriller helmed by Hollywood darling David Fincher, whose resume includes Seven, and with a cast that includes Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and the wonderful Deborah Unger could not fail to deliver.

It does fail and there are two reasons why. One is the screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris. They obviously think that patronising the audience's intellect will somehow makes us believe we are witnessing a work of genius. The other is Fincher's preoccupation with style and visuals. Now there is nothing wrong with that per se but it should not be at the expense of content. With the benefit of hindsight I am sure the Producers could have engaged Tony Scott for half the price!

The plot, such as it is, involves a birthday gift to millionaire businessman Douglas (resurrecting his Gordon Gekko role) from his seedy and disreputable (what else!) brother Penn (Carlito's Way?). The gift comprises an invitation to participate in a ""Game"" run by the mysterious Consumer Recreation Services company.

Once Douglas reluctantly joins the ""Game"" he is gradually drawn into a nightmare world where mishaps perpetrated against him become increasingly dangerous and violent. He desperately tries to retain control of events as his world falls apart.

I am sure the writers intended us to be astounded by the cleverness of each new twist and gasp in awe at every predicament that befalls our hapless victim as we, the poor dumb audience, try to make sense of it before all is revealed. Unfortunately, we never stood a chance because the clues were never put there by the writers. All red herrings and no rosetta stone I'm afraid.

The problem is that by two thirds in to the film the events have become so laughably far-fetched and unbelievable that we no longer care what happens to the beleaguered Douglas or why they are happening.

The denouement to the movie, when it comes, is so preposterous we almost want to believe the writers planned the whole thing as one big joke on the audience, sadly, this movie is not as smart as they would have you believe.

It fails as a black comedy because it's neither dark enough nor funny enough and is simply too ridiculous to work as a thriller. Deborah Unger and character actor James Rebhorn try valiantly to inject some life and Douglas and Penn do what they do best, but ultimately it's an empty exercise. And if all this wasn't bad enough it's got a soundtrack that includes Jefferson Airplane!

Fincher has flirted with great filmmaking with the dark and bleak Severn and undoubtedly knows how to light a movie to create a foreboding and tense atmosphere. He adopts the same stylish visuals to good effect here but until he finds a script worthy of his style and talent the jury will remain out as to whether he really is one of Hollywood's great filmmakers.

I have no doubt this movie will do well because it is slick, glossy and pushes all the right buttons for an undemanding audience and at the end of the day that is what the studio executives want. More demanding audiences will be disappointed.

Verdict: Rent the Out of Towners with Jack Lemmon instead.",2
28 June 2015,Bit of fun,"If you're like me...

Go into this movie expecting a bit of fun and not too much more than that, hence my 6/10 rating. The movie starts well and creates a lot of intrigue to the possibilities of what ""The Game"" might be. Though the whole time I was wondering if it could live up to the hype - that would be what decides the fate of the movie, is it going to be an ever unravelling puzzle which never really gets solved?

The puzzle will be solved, though it's certainly nonsensical and to be taken light heartedly. Don't worry about trying to take this movie too seriously, as you'll be disappointed with whether certain things are all that realistic. You have to get beyond that and imagine that it's plausible.

If you like David Fincher, expect the usual suspense, mystery and thrill that surrounds his movies, but not to the same high class. That's down to the plot rather than any fault of Fincher's. I don't think the movie (written how it is) has as much potential as Se7en, Gone Girl, Fight Club, even though at the start you would maybe think he could be onto another real hit.

Michael Douglas is well cast as the middle aged wealthy hotshot banker who goes through life without much spontaneity and fun, so his brother (Sean Penn) decides to get him involved in ""The Game"" to spice things up. Penn isn't in the film too much, so not necessarily one to watch just because you're a Penn fan, though the parts where we do see him, he's very typically emotionally Penn. That's a good standard as usual, but nothing new or lengthy here.

What stops this movie being great? It's certainly not down to acting or direction, in my eyes just the over elaborate plot which could've done a couple of things differently, so that in the end it all made sense. It's the ""that could never happen"" factor which stops it being great. It was possible to keep the plot along the same lines, with the same outcomes, but with different details in between. They instead chose a route which was implausible. That was the downfall unfortunately.

Still, I didn't mind enough to dislike it. I was especially intrigued at the start, and you do want to see where they go with the story. You want to find out what ""The Game"" is.

It's not one that i'll be revisiting anytime soon, but i'm glad I gave it a go. Have fun.",6
13 June 2020,Interesting and strange thriller,"I remember sometime in the early 2000's I happened to see the latter half of this movie on tv and thought it was amazing. But I never saw the beginning until now. I still liked the movie now but I think it was even better when I started to watch it from the middle, having no clue about what's going on. That made it even more surprising.

It's an interesting thriller where the main character's (Michael Douglas) life becomes a chaos because he can't anymore distinguish reality from a game he takes part in. The plot is quite crazy, and even if you try to understand it, it seems unrealistic and a bit ridiculous. But that doesn't matter because it's a thrilling ride with a feeling of mystery. And the ending is really good, so be sure to watch it all the way.

20 April 2001,Fast Paced Puzzle Box,"Intellegent film that loses itself at the end. Enjoyed this much more than David Fincher's previous film, Seven(1995). Michael Douglas gives a brilliant performance as a man who is bored with his predictable life. Things goes out of wack for him when he is given a unique game as a birthday present by his younger brother. There are scenes that are worthy of David Cronenberg. The Game(1997) never loses its nerve wecking intensity and suspense for one second. The direction is highly charged and well imagined. One actor that makes an impression is Out of the Blue(1980) star Linda Manz as one of Claire's friends. Sean Pean is excellent as Nicholas Von Orton's rebellious and unpredictable brother, Conrad.

15 June 2020,"Not one of Fincher's best, but a fun movie nonetheless","This movie starts very weak, but ends very strong. You just have to accept that the game makes no sense and that it's totally dependant on things no one could possibly predict or control. Once you accept that, it's a lot of fun to just go along with this film.

As I mentioned earlier, the first half (and maybe a bit more) isn't the best. Becuase there's apparently only so much you can do with the premise of an alternate reality game gone too far, it becomes pretty repetitive very quickly. However, once Michael Douglass wakes up in Mexico, the film picks up again and becomes better than ever.

It's not one of David Fincher's best movies (in fact, I would say it's his weakest film, not counting Alien 3), but his direction is so good and the thrid act so bonkers that I have to reccomend it.

27 August 2018,"Great premise -- flawed execution, but it doesnt even matter","This is a fantastic story with constant twists and turns.

It has flaws. The dialogue is shaky at best in many places, and they frequently break the ""Show, dont tell"" rule which really takes you out of the movie. They literally have a character or two set up purely to be the ""tellers"" who tell everything to the audience bc they couldnt figure out how to show it adequately.

But the flaws dont even matter bc it is so exciting and thrilling that you forget about the flaws. It still would be better without them though. Its a great way to feel paranoid for a few hours after seeing it.

26 July 2021,Do not read the IMDb plot it's a spoiler,"Solid . Time tested, I saw this in theaters and 24 years ago and then again recently. Just watch it if your questioning because the less you know the better. Micheal Douglas , Sean Penn is even in it -it's surprising that there was never an attempt at a remake, I doubt it could be done better.

24 April 2005,Admit To Yourself That It Sounds Intriguing...,"What do you get for the man who has everything? On his 48th birthday, repressed financier Nicholas Van Orton gets a gift from his brother... it's a ""profound life experience"" that ""provides whatever's lacking,"" a ""vacation that comes to you,"" a game... and so begins a suspense film so brilliant, so tricky, so beautifully conceived and executed that you will never forget it.

""The Game"" is a classic on par with Hitchcock's best... not since Alfred's 60's masterpieces has a movie so thoroughly- and enjoyably- messed with your mind. Michael Douglas is born to play the isolated Van Orton, Sean Penn pitch-perfect as his dangerous younger brother. The movie, directed by the divine David Fincher, is shot so beautifully it may make you cry. Witness the depth of the darkness, the weight of the frame, the gravity of the actors... this is the work of a master at the top of his game. If a great director is a great storyteller than Fincher can tell tales like no one else... he is in absolute control from frame one to the final credit roll.

I won't give you the details of Nicholas' game... after all, figuring out the game is the point of the game. I will say that I'm glad I saw this in the theater on opening day but it's almost better on the small screen- letter-boxed of course. If you haven't seen ""The Game"" I suggest you buy the DVD and watch it right away... trust me when I say you'll want to own it. If you love movies you will LOVE this precision-crafted puzzle, a movie that will not only keep you guessing but be just as (or more) entertaining on repeated viewings. Don't read online reviews that will blow the story or color your opinion... you need to experience this firsthand... you owe it to yourself.

God bless David Fincher for messing with our minds, for creating a classic in the era of disposable film, for appreciating the intelligence of the audience while keeping three steps ahead. ""The Game"" rocks!

28 December 2009,Hitchcock would be proud.,"The best thrillers have two things: growing tension and an unpredictable plot. David Fincher's masterpiece has that, and something that few thrillers, even the best ones, have: the belief that anything can happen at any time. Quite frankly, this is one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.

Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a millionaire who's life is perfect. He's fabulously wealthy, and although he's divorced, his ex-wife still calls him on his birthday. A day late, his deadbeat brother Conrad (Sean Penn) shows up and hands him a birthday present: an invitation to participate in a game offered by Consumer Recreation Services.

More than that, I cannot and will not say. Let me just say this: never let your guard down while watching this movie. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, or when you think Nick is safe (for the time being), the film pulls a fast one, and everything you thought you knew changed. It's a one-of-a-kind experience when a thriller is so skillfully put together that you can't rely on the thriller to stay on the traditional rhythm.

From an acting standpoint, the only performance that really matters is Michael Douglas; everyone else is strictly supporting. Douglas is a master at playing cold, hard, ruthless businessmen, and Nicholas Van Orton is right up his alley. Connections to Gordon Gekko are eerily similar, except that Nick is sympathetic, while Gekko was deliciously villainous. Support is ably provided by Sean Penn, and character actors Deborah Kara Unger and James Rebhorn. All are perfectly cast, although Sean Penn is especially interesting; we really believe that Conrad and Nick are brothers. The film's handling of the villain, Consumer Recreation Services, is brilliant. Faceless, non-speaking villains are difficult to pull off effectively, but when they work, they are frightening. We never know what to expect from CRS, or when.

The real star of ""The Game,"" however, is David Fincher. With every film, the former music video director gets better every time. Although I liked ""Seven,"" it doesn't hold a candle to this one. This is Hitchcock for the 90's. It is perfectly paced, and the suspense rarely lets up.

Don't miss it!",10
19 May 2016,Felcher's best - very underrated,"I know it's got about an 8/10 here on IMDb but its metascore is only 61, which is a ridiculous average, and overall people just never ever ever talk about this film although by my count this is a better film than Seven or Fight Club which weren't as clever or well constructed or intelligent as this one, and they get a ton more notoriety. Douglas is just superb in this one, and Penn, Unger put in very good performances as seconds too. It's a film which concept is so concise you'd think it should be made into an episode of a mystery-type series, and that it could never work out as a 2hrs+ silverscreen production, that its plot would run out of breath too soon and that it would need a bunch of exterior elements added to the plot to keep it relevant and that eventually the dynamics of it would be bent towards the middle-to-end area because the twist seems obvious etc... but none of that. None of it at all. The film is completely coherent with its tamed, nightly atmosphere. It is subtle and vows to put most technical questions about the plot the viewer may have to sleep. It's very careful and professionally handled in laying out all the premises and details necessary to making the plot possible, plausible; and til the very end, we are truly kept away from the secret. The twist is very strong, and a satisfying release of tension, with questions answered; and quite moving too. All in all, very ambitious project, and: mission accomplished. Superb piece.",8

12 November 2020,What was the point again?,"The music drove me nuts... The constant 5 piano notes throughout the whole damn thing was so annoying. It was overdone by 5X.

Also didn't buy that Penn was his brother. Not good casting. I guess it was somewhat fun, but I am not sure what the point was behind it. It was more of just a roller coaster without any big lesson. Some films work like that, for example Taken was just one big thrill ride, but it kinda worked. This one, not so much. It felt monotonous. And too many things didn't make sense. Why didn't he just go to a police station? Why did such a rich man only ave one house keeper/maid who made him sandwiches? I didn't buy that and why didn't he show her the vandalized house? They expect us to believe she never heard or saw them going to vandalize the house and he didn't even think to ask that>

I could go on about plot holes.

I rate this mediocre.",5
5 May 2002,Jon Monsarrat review: Intelligent & with something to say,"At first glance, ""The Game"" is purely a psychological thriller. But the twists and turns in the plot are all neatly connected, but always keeps you guessing, in the style of ""Memento"".

Great acting all around, especially can't-fail actor Michael Douglas, and -- without giving away the story -- the film does have something to say about life. And it is all wrapped up in the end, unlike the old TV shows ""The Prisoner"" and ""Twin Peaks"" which got crazier and crazier and then, um, they admit even the writers have no idea what's going on.

For an action movie guy like me, who isn't into dramas, The Game had not too much finesse and just the right intelligent attitude. But you don't need to follow all the intricate connections to enjoy the film.

Who should see this film:

-- Action movie buffs of all types

-- Pranksters: a must-see

-- Drama film buffs with nothing better to do on a rainy day.

But don't expect any romance.

I'll give ""The Game"" a well-deserved 9 out of 10.",9

10 September 2008,The one to beat,"This movie starts off like an idle running car engine and increases in excitement steadily accelerating to a full roaring jet engine and then goes ""pop"" at the end like an orgasm. I stood up after seeing it on the small screen (at home on video) with my mouth wide open and said ""That's the best one I've ever seen"". I'm not the Lone Ranger, many others agree with me. I've heard a critic say that it's ""too much to swallow"". No it's not, It's a movie, It's fiction, It's supposed to be a stretch. I say if you just go along with it, ""The Game"" will stimulate your adult mental palate like no other movie, it's like great porn, but for your head, not your little head. There should be a golden arrow that rides along the ceiling of all the video stores through all the different sections (horror, sci-fi, etc.) right up to a special little shelf with ""The Game"" on it that just says ""The one to beat"", Until there is one better...

10 September 2000,Still A Great Watch,"I watched this movie for the third time just today and it's still great fun. One of the characters in the movie sums it up perfectly when he says he wishes he could just forget it all, go back, and do it again...I wish I could watch this movie again with no knowledge of what really happens...it could throw me all over again!

A fun thing to do while watching is to identify when, if you were in Mr. Douglas' shoes, you would go completely mad.

28 April 1999,Best film of 1997,"Mind twisting, paranoia inducing suspense about a control freak whose life is turned upside down. Michael Douglas stars in his best performance since Falling Down and Sean Penn does a fine job in the role of his younger conniving brother. Debroah Unger is sexy as the token female lead/love intrest. When I originally saw this in the theater I walked out of it so paranoid that I was looking over both shoulders for a week. This movie has strong writting and directing. Even a decent soundtrack (A rarity for a suspense/thriller). Attention to detail and a twisted sense of humor are what keep this movie a head above the rest. But keep in mind that the man that rented this to you could be involved. But it's all just a game or is it?

11 August 2021,Enthralling until its far-fetched ending,"I love David Fincher as he's a skilled director that is able to make outstanding films. The Game is one of his most suspenseful yet weaker films.

The Game follows Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy banker that receives a gift from his brother which allows him to participate in a mysterious game.

Thrillers have been something David Fincher has been good at making. He has the talent to bring out so much tension and stretch it all the way through to create a captivating experience. The Game is another example of Fincher's abilities to conjure suspense as a large portion of this film was tense and very interesting. Not only was it fun to see Michael Douglas get into strange situations but the film leaves us with many questions as to what is actually going on. The constant guessing of what's taking place had me hooked onto The Game's story. It builds and builds to situations that you don't see coming and Fincher utilises its intense premise to its advantage. There's a particular scene taking place in a taxi that's so well executed. As the film was building, I was excited to find out the big reveal at the end. However, when the ending happened, that's when the film came crashing down for me. The ending seemed way too convenient in my eyes and it became very difficult for me to suspend my disbelief.

The performances are all very good. Michael Douglas gives one of his best as Nicholas Van Orton. He pulls of the desperation and paranoia the character develops throughout the film really well. Sean Penn is also great in the film even though he has very limited screen time. Deborah Kara Unger did a good job as well and it was fun guessing whether she was in on the game or not.

The Game is a strong thriller through its first acts but the third act is where the film asks us to suspend too much disbelief which I wasn't able to do. Despite that, Fincher does a great job keeping the suspense intact and Michael Douglas delivers a strong performance in the role.",7
1 February 2004,Cat and mouse with oneself,"I really enjoyed the Game as it has all I ask for in a film.

It has a bit of a drama, getting personal with its main hero and his relationship with this brother, it has lots of action keeping you well on your seat, a very clever twist from start to finish to ensure intrigue is there but above all as far as I can remember it is the only cat and mouse chase but not against any enemy but with his own self.

It started as a birthday gift from Sean Penn to Michael Douglas, who he though it was some escort service but when he decided to accept this gift/game took over his life.

This will not be thought as one of the best movies of all time but the fact remains is a very good movie not to be passed by.

12 December 2014,Something of a shaggy dog story but well worth the ride,"You've got something if you can slowly ratchet up the tension and keep us guessing until the last minute, but David Fincher's The Game is essentially a high-value shaggy dog story. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but in my book a film has slightly missed the point if you can't watch it again and again.

Well, of course, you could watch The Game again and again, but once you know how it all ends, doing so becomes a little pointless. Then there's the danger that whereas the first time round we are sitting on the edges of our seats wondering where Michael Douglas's bad luck will take him next and, not least, what the hell is it all about, at second, third and maybe even fourth viewings - and knowing full well how it all plays out - the viewer will start picking holes here, there and everywhere. That would be unfair, of course, but that's exactly what we would do.

But what the hell: you are either reading this wondering whether is worth your time taking a gander, in which case I say unequivocally 'go for it'. Or you have seen it, have your own view about how good a film it is and are wondering what others made of it. In that case, you probably agree with me that it's worth the ride, but starts to lose on points the more you reflect on it.

I, too, have been looking at the opinions of others, and should warn the first-time viewer that although it is all hugely enjoyable and intriguing, it is, at the end of the day, just a piece of very well-made, thoroughly gripping hooey. Great filmmaking it ain't.",7
18 December 2016,It's just a game ?,"A mess that works, so we can define ""The Game"", David Fincher, puts us in the role of Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a millionaire who has a quiet life and away from everything and everyone, until his brother invites him For a game. Well, if I continue to count it will be spoiler, a high point of the film is its script, which has many twists, and the viewer suffers along with Nicholas, although it has a bit of utopia, ""The Game"" does not have a message to us Say, perhaps the message of the sovereign man, rich and powerful who deep down has feelings, or perhaps of the man who has everything and has to learn to have nothing, Maybe, well, maybe, David hardly explores these elements, and over time You do not understand the rhythm of the movie anymore, it's slow and fast time, but even so, the viewer does not lose his attention in the film, not even for a second, Fincher came from Seven, where he abused language figures in his photograph , But if you expect something like this here, well, forget it. Fincher does the basics, but does a lot of quality with this basic, soundtrack, editing, photography, mixing and editing, everything is in a good standard, the performances are also good. Finally, ""The Game"" is a good movie to put on the resume and does not disappoint, but to the standard David Fincher, is reasonable.",8
7 February 2009,They won't leave me alone! I'm a goddamn human-piñata!,"David Fincher follows up ""Seven"", the by ""The Silence of The Lambs"" influenced thriller that broke out of genre conventions and subsequently became the second most influential thriller of the nineties, with another puzzler. ""The Game"" lays it's cards out in plain sight from the get-go: figuring out the object of the game is the game. Which doubles the fun if Fincher's smoke and mirrors fool you.

When his unkempt brother Conrad (Sean Penn) first tries to warm him up for the idea of actually participating in ""The Game"", Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), aggravated, says 'he hates surprises'. Conrad pleads: 'It's a profound life experience'; prompting Nicholas to reply: 'Like a stroke?'. Fools speak the truth when they're joking. Van Orton soon finds himself in a roller-coaster with no seat belts, and he forcibly comes to an insight when the cart plummets into the abyss.

If there is such a category, I'd put ""The Game"" in with escapist thrillers: pretension-less, fun, keep-you-guessing films with twists as a goal onto itself. Therefore, people shouldn't stumble over the improbabilities in the plot. It's like reading Jim Thompson, a man who does not know the meaning of the word restraint as far as hardboiled characters and plot u-turns go.

Fincher directs straightforward thrillers with such a sleight of hand, I can think of no contemporary directors who can match his skills in the genre. Cinematographically, ""The Game"" was well ahead of it's time. It seems DP Harris Savides and Fincher make a great team: they also collaborated on ""Zodiac"". Both films' night time scenes take my breath away. Add three time Academy Award winning composer Howard Shore into the mix and what you get is a very effective psychological thriller.",9
19 February 1999,Engrossing thrill ride,"If you're the type of person who comes to movies just for escapism, this is a good movie to watch. It's a thrill ride that always keeps you guessing, yet it's enjoyable and keeps you glued. John Brancato and Michael Ferris were also the credited writers on ""The Net"", and like that underrated film, this asks the question; what if everything you took for granted was thrown out of whack? Another way to see this is as the ultimate virtual reality movie. And like any good director, David Fincher turns the screws so subtly that by the time you realize he's done it, you're hooked already.

Michael Douglas, of course, has played so many yuppies he can do them in his sleep, but luckily he didn't here. He even shows the man behind the facade here. Sean Penn seems an unlikely choice, but he keeps you guessing. One performer who gets overlooked usually is Deborah Kara Unger. Her role may not be that big, but it's certainly key, and the ambiguity she radiates fits perfectly with the tone of the film. Good character actors like James Rebhorn and Armin Mueller-Stahl also turn in memorable performances. As for the ending, I can understand how some may have felt cheated, but I loved it.",10

30 August 2014,"Thrilled, Enraged, Happy (sorta, or maybe just... MIND BLOWN)","From what I had read I was expecting from the beginning of the movie a twist ending but ,it has offered me so much more than that, I would call it a double twist kind of movie.

It is a psychological movie that really kept me in suspense until the end.

During this very elaborate plot I went through different emotional states from confusion to understanding, rage and finally shock. This movie made me think I that I really understood the story, coming to the same conclusion as the waitress told the main character and I could only think of a very weird, open ending. The other characters beside the main one, were very little presented leaving me with a sense of mystery. I think even if you put the puzzle pieces together it is hard to get to the real conclusion, because a lot of the pieces are missing or they don't make any sense. Douglas portrays extremely well the character's various emotions and he really got me sad and enraged, seeking justice for what he went through. It is a psychological movie that really kept me in suspense until the end OVERALL I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE with a MIND BLOWING ENDING!!! I will not go into more details just... WATCH IT!",9
25 April 2001,the best film i've seen this year.,"I only just watched this film the other week after putting it off for ages, i never really got excited enough about it to sit down and watch a Michael Douglas film is,nt what i would put high on my list, not because i dislike him but i never really get drawn into his style of film if there is a thriller like this on one sky channel and an all guns blazing action film on the other then i'm likely to watch the action flick for the adrenaline rush. Now i wish i had watched this sooner and at the cinema. This is an absolutely brilliant film the writing of it is excellent, despite its far fetched idea and happenings (none of the events of the film could ever really happen the way it did in the film). The direction is also first rate and the atmosphere that is created is so tense and really creates a sense of paranoia, i unfortunately missed the first ten or so minutes but the Game as such had not really got started so i lucked out, i can't really explain why i found this film so intrigueing, its an edge of the seat affair that is brilliantly acted and strange because after the film i was trying to think what just went on and you want to see it again much like Finchers other film Fight club which is also excellent, but i do prefer this. I don't know quite why i was never bothered about watching this especailly considering how excellent it was and i must say to watch it at the cinema in the dark would be excellent i hope the do have a special re-showing of this like they do with some films. All in all not to be missed, and it requires two viewings unfortunately i haven't watched for the second time so i'll have to buy it, well done all involved in the making of this i say.",10
24 May 2002,One nasty game!,"This is not David Fincher's masterpiece but is still incredibly exciting thriller and mind game. We follow the rich banker's (Michael Douglas, a great actor!) boring life as he lives alone in his large mansion and is bored of all around him. His wife has left him and it only makes things worse. However, his birthday comes and his brother (Sean Penn) has given him something very unusual for a present. ""What can I give to a man who owns already everything?"" he asks and gives Douglas an envelope. He opens it and finds an invitation to a game...And that's all I'm gonna tell you. The less you know about the film, the better.

This film is very original and exciting, and will have many twists and turns throughout the whole film. Once you think that ""Oh yeah, that's it!"" a new twist will arrive and the viewer is again totally lost, as is the main protagonist. It is horrible to think that something like this happened in real life. The film is often very scary because nobody knows what's going on and the film is pretty dark in lightning, a Fincher trademark. The main point seems to be here that never forget the fact that no matter how rich or wealthy you are, you're still a human being who can die or loose everything like anyone else. Prosperity and power don't make anyone immortal or stronger than others and all the human beings are as vulnerable as others. The film is a lesson in living and remembering the facts of life.

Extremely pleasant little psycho thriller with fresh script and chilling moments, but actually who would expect Fincher to do something bad or dull? Lovers of Fincher cinema should like this and there are no elements (violence, sex) that often alienate some people, so I think that many will find this film nice to experience. Or then, it may be too intelligent and difficult to follow for casual popcorn eating viewer..

23 March 2019,One of the best thrillers!!!!,"One of the best HOLLYWOOD thrillers ever created in the history. I remember I was sitting and scrolling through the TV and suddenly I stopped on this movie. IT has just started and since that minute I was sitting on the sofa and watching this movie. It caught y attention and I was unable to detach from it. The plot is very interesting and the tension is kept till the very last minute of the film. The creators of this films are geniuses. They payed attention to every little detail. Also the films like this which involve a ""game"" in them, require much more work and hard work to avoid any misunderstanding and to give the feeling of the reality. When I was watching this movie felt everything what the main actor felt and for me it is the main indicator of the well directed movie. I am sure I will be constantly rewatching it in the future.

29 October 2002,"Only rented since cast included Douglas, Penn, Baker & Manz","If you saw the trailers for this then you know the whole setup and it is just a matter of waiting for the twists and tricks and chase scenes to finally end. That being said, the movie is above average for this type of affair. I agree with Spleen's review almost 100 percent so read that one. I actually rented this because Michael Douglas is someone who I feel can really carry a picture. He has a presence which is unequaled. That voice of his has power. Also in the movie is Sean Penn and he is a guy who always has integrity in his film choices. Also cast in this movie are a couple of folks that really got pulled out of the mothballs. Carroll Baker played the elderly housekeeper and I will always remember her as the teenage Baby Doll. Linda Manz had a bit part that lasted all of 10 seconds and I will always remember her as a kid in Days of Heaven and Out of the Blue. Having those two in there seemed to add a bit to the surreal effect.

12 March 1999,Disappointment from Fincher,"When David Fincher made Se7en I instantly had him among my favorite directors. If he makes more films like ""The Game"" I will have to exclude him from the list again.

The Game is uninteresting. What was the point of making it besides the entertainment. We have seen this ""cruel man turns into a softy"" theme a thousand times before, so why make another movie about it, if you cannot add something new. I like a movie to question my view of the world and this movie is not even close to do so.


The Game is unbelievable. How can the people behind the game predict the actions of the participant (Michael Douglass) so precisely. Where he goes, jumps, runs, shoots, etc..






Some of the commentators on this movie, have stated that The Game is in the same category as Se7en. Stay away from me, if you really mean that. You should not even compare the two movies. It's like comparing apples and oranges.

16 April 2000,Mind Boggling! A Must See.,"The Game is the best thriller ever! I just want to mention that Michael Douglas has really hit the mark as an actor. Michael Douglas is one of Hollywood's best actors an all time great, his role in the Game his best ever performance puts him in a class of his own. The Game can best be described as a puzzler about a control freak billionaire (Michael Douglas) caught in a deadly swirl of cat and mouse when his younger disreputable brother (Sean Penn) gives him a gift certificate to participate in a mysterious game that invades his ordered existence. Douglas's role of Nicholas Van Orton has to win the deadly game or lose control of life. After Van Orton battles the mystery and ultimate terror challenge of ""The Game"", surprise all just a birthday gift. The object of any game is fear and surprise. The Game is a must see due to Michael Douglas's no nonsense acting and the thrilling mystery that boggles your mind, only to harmlessly surprise in the end. A must see, Michael Douglas at his best.

6 February 2003,Nice birthday present,"I saw this movie in theater on its opening weekend. It was my birthday and I felt like giving myself a small birthday present.

I sat there enthralled and engaged in the plot. The tension and intrigue were great, emanating from great directing and a believable performance from the entire cast. It makes you think and try to fit the pieces together, while remaining slightly edgy and always moving forward. The best part of the movie is its slightly eccentric, but ultimately original and daring script that made Nicolas Van Horton's birthday present my birthday present worthwhile.

You cannot forget an ending like this. Some did not care for it much, most loved it, I simply adored it. I sat there end watched the screen even as the credit rolled and kept saying to myself ""I can't believe he did that, I can't believe they did that"". Refering both to the character and the writing team (who wrote ""Terminator 3, coming to a theater near you"" by the way). Unbelievable.

It helps that talented David Fincher was able to work with this crazy script, keeping it dark and intriging and bringing it to its ultimate climax.

Must see.",9
23 August 2008,Original design yet marred by cavernous sized plot-holes,"The basic premise of this movie is that the character played by Michael Douglas, an extremely wealthy, snobby, aristocratic, Los Angeles business man, has everything in the world he could ever desire. So it's his birthday, and his brother proposes, ""What do you get your brother for his birthday when he already has everything he could possibly have in the entire world?"" Well, it turns out, you buy him a real life action sequence set up as a game, that the receiver of the gift, played by Douglas, will never know when his game starts, and won't know when it will end until that exact moment.

For the next hour after the game begins we, as the viewers, are taken on a long journey filled with on-foot and car chases, shootouts, kidnapping, explosions, and other cliché and typical action sequences.

Unfortunately, the action is so ridiculously over the top, that it can only be seen as a plot hole, bad writing even. Because the organizers of the game destroy cars, structures, entire houses, create explosions, fire assault automatic rifles off in the middle of downtown L.A. with no police repercussions for any of this. Suspending disbelief is just too impossible for this level of activity being unnoticed by local authorities. Not to mention many of the actors in the game impersonate federal, state and local law enforcement, and EMTs, all felonious acts.

Not to pigeonhole the movie into the 'all action no substance' genre that Hollywood is often accused of, the movie creates some horribly written dialog that is melodramatic, philosophical, and preachy. Not qualities that are fitting for an action-thriller movie, and serve to mostly get in the way of the explosions.

The cinematography, audio post production, and especially the acting, are all brilliant. The plot, and writing, and editing however are amateur at best and take away from the positives significantly.

Though the idea of this film is extremely original, the premise takes much creative license with reality and runs wild with an absurdly furious and unrealistic pace that would never go unnoticed by proper authorities. Everything that happens in the movie is part of 'the game' that the main character is experiencing. Factor in a $50 million budget then, and you have to wonder how his drug addicted, jobless, impecunious, and unkempt brother could have possibly afforded to pay for this birthday present. Throw in the fact that the company that runs that game would have to insure every aspect of the game that brings the total of the cost of one play-through of the game into the $100 million range. I just can't suspend disbelief that much for a movie that ignored its plot-holes to get straight to the explosions.",5
22 January 2004,What a birthday gift!,"This is certainly one of the most intelligent films I have watched. It's a big action one with a great surprise in the end. It's Sean Penn, one of the best actors in the world, in a good performance and Michael Douglas good as well. I first watched it back in 1997 or 1998. Now I'm watching it again. It's worth watching again! So get this film and enjoy it!

3 May 2003,"Paranoiac, thought-provoking and highly entertaining thriller.","Always keeping you on the edge of your seat, `The Game' is a brilliantly crafted psychological thriller with a cool scenario. And the promising plot leads to a conclusion that doesn't disappoint. The storyline alone is enough to recommend `The Game' but this is well backed up on most other levels. The script is well timed with plenty of imaginative sequences along with more twists and turns than a helter-skelter. There are also some appropriately dark directing techniques that are frequently used along with cool camera angles.

The acting is very good, even if it is mainly a one-man-show. Michael Douglas was well cast in the lead role and the paranoia and odd occurrences in his normally quiet lifestyles make his transition very convincing. Sean Penn doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but does well in the few scenes that he's in. Deborah Kara Unger is standard is Christine, the woman you can and can't trust. There's some other average support from the likes of James Rebhorn, Armin Mueller Stahl and an actress that appeared to have vanished off the face of the Earth- Carroll Baker.

The film grips like glue and doesn't let go until the `smack-in-the-face' conclusion. It doesn't make a whole lot of logical sense, but then again this is Hollywood we're talking about. Another good thing is the way it is so involving. We feel as though we are plunged into this world of surprises and betrayal that the protagonist is experiencing.

It's an engaging puzzle that has to be worked out, so `The Game' is quite possibly the best psychological `rubix cube' thriller in years. It may heavily border on surrealism at times, but still remains very enjoyable and highly tense. I give it 7.9/10.",

29 June 2007,What the F*** is going on here....,"My seven word title is the best way that I can summarize this movie. And don't get me wrong I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, in fact I wish more movies left me with that type of reaction. This movie is the definition of a thriller, and all others in that genre should use ""The Game"" as their template. This movie also ranks number 44 on the 100 scariest movie moments of all time, and ""The Game"" is not even a horror movie. Also, its first person camera shots and eerie situations are sure to suck any viewer into ""The Game"", and even though I'm literally ten years late with this review I hope it was a little helpful. I mean I can't talk about a movie from 1997 at the water-cooler if you know what I mean.

27 July 2012,A lively and exciting puzzle-gimmick thriller!,"A lively and exciting puzzle-gimmick thriller! Riveting, from start to end - David Fincher does it again after his slick & grim thriller, Se7en. Though a few plot-holes are there, movie is a well-paced and exhilarating ride. Just when you think that you've figured it all out, the movie turns upon you.

Michael Douglas is the soul of the movie; he gets into the character and carries the movie on his shoulders. Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger, though having small roles, are terrific and make their presence felt.

The movie ends with a spectacular and satisfying conclusion!

26 June 2021,The Game,"The movie suffers a bit from being too confusing and the ending isn't as satisfying as it should be but I still think the game is a highly underrated suspenseful thriller that has some of the best twists and turns I have ever seen in a film. The first time I saw it I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and even though I have seen the film several times now its still as engaging and intriguing as it was the first time. Michael Douglas gives a fantastic performance and the supporting cast especially Sean Penn are great as well. David Fincher is one of my favourite filmmakers and the game is easily his most underrated hidden gem.

14 September 2013,Best Movie Ever.,"I saw this years and years ago. I just watched it again for the second time as I have always said it was genius and highly recommended it, and I wondered if I would watch it now and think it was silly as we so often do with changes in maturity levels and experiences.

Honestly still one of the best concepts ever. In fact, even though the ultimate point of this movie is the twisting and turning and epic ending, and this time I watched it with the understanding of the plot, I STILL enjoyed it immensely and would still recommend it as highly. The actors are all brilliant, even the supporting roles, and the idea is something that I think is one of the best concepts Hollywood has ever come up with. I don't think they could ever remake this without ruining it and ""Hollywoodizing"" it, so I am glad it was made as well as it was the first time.

The only movie so far that I have given 10 / 10",10
17 October 2009,The object of the game is not a part of the game,"According to Game Theory (a branch of mathematics), a game consists of a set of players, a set of moves (or strategies) available to those players, and a specification of payoffs for each combination of strategies. What make several non-mathematicians astonish in this definition is that nothing is said about the object of playing. From non-mathematical games we know that one can play with balls, chess-figures, straws (Halma), dominoes, etc. But what happens when one of the players become the object of the play or game? According to the above definition, then, he must know about the moves of the game, and also about the specification of payoffs for every move - in this special case also for his own moves and not only for those of the other players.

This is, abstractly said, what ""The Game"" (1997), a very intelligent and metaphysically deep movie, is about. Mr. Van Orton gets as a very special gift from his brother with whom he has a very problematic relationship, a gift which is on first sight nothing more than an entrance billet to a VIP-club. After Mr. Van Orton has filled in a very detailed questionnaire, the play starts - but without knowing him any parts which belong per definition to any game. As a matter of fact, the audience who does in this case not has the luck of the distant observer to be always at least one step in front of the protagonist, gets involved in the game, too, and without knowing that until just before the movie ends. Therefore, the game, which is based, both the main actor and for the watcher, on fully obscure rules, appears more like a dream, or better a nightmare, and the only question in the two hours of running time is: When and how will this nightmare end? In the end, however, one will see that a game which is based on the violation of all defining rules of what a game must be, has to follow enormously complex rules in order not to risk the life of the object of the game.",

16 May 2021,You just lost The Game,"As Michael Douglas' banker-turned-pawn is thrown around the city, addled and confused, you begin to understand just where the story is heading. ""The Game"" is a film with the tiresome features cut out: no love-story complication, no excess story baggage, just the fun bits you wanted to see.

Starring Douglas, Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger, this movie relies on slight suspension of belief. Being a high-flying banker, Douglas is gifted by his brother (Penn) one ticket to 'The Game' - a living-game experience that promises to be unlike anything he has seen before. This, whilst not a novel concept, is executed effectively enough to keep the audience guessing throughout, and manages to wrap the story up semi-succinctly towards the finale.

My only qualm, however (omitting spoilers), is style of the ending - it feels like a departure from both the nature of the characters and the story, given the way it portrays itself as a maze of lies and deception. Still, Penn and Douglas do enough to pull it off, and the story is rewarding in the sense that you are still unsure of the conclusion till the final act.

It looks and sounds decent, but nothing that makes or breaks the film. The environments do look genuine (Douglas spends a lot of time in the high-life frequents of the city), and the CRB Building is a particuarly smart touch.

Is this a world beater? Not really. Is it a fun watch that will pass the time? Certainly. Douglas is authentically cynical-turned-exasperated, and Penn's estranged brother angle is engaging in his few scenes. ""The Game"" won't blow your head off, but it's not half bad either.",7
7 November 2022,Just Didn't Do It for Me,"I went into this nearly completely blind, and it was an interesting experience to say the least. Obviously, judging by the rating, I didn't like this very much, but it has some really good positives, but lots of negatives. This review will most likely be shorter than average, but that doesn't really matter. So, I guess it's time to start the review? I don't know, I'm not good at transitions lmao

The story here is actually good! The psychological aspect was done really well, and the mystery was intriguing. The problem I have is nearly every other aspect. But before I talk about the negatives, it's only fair if I talk about the stuff I did like. I liked the ending a lot. With the amount of build up they had, it would be hard to stick a landing like this, but surprisingly, they pull it off, which I can not say for a lot of movies that have tons of build up for the ending. The set up for the story is good because it hooks you in. I was interested to see how this was going to go. The other positive is that the acting was great. No bad actors, instead everyone did good jobs in the roles they were given. I think that's all I can say in terms of positives though.

To start with the negatives, let's start with the characters. The protagonist was ok-ish. He was entertaining to watch, but I never formed any connection with him. Normally I'm able to form connections with characters very easily, and at the minimum, I don't want any characters to die, but in The Game, I could care less if the protagonist died, same with any other main characters/side characters, which is not a good thing. The other characters were annoying and the ending didn't change my opinion of them. The next problem I have is the soundtrack. The soundtrack SUCKS! It is SO repetitive that at certain point you're just going to wish they did what No Country for Old Men did, and have no soundtrack at all. This kind of movie could have benefitted greatly from a strong soundtrack, and disappointingly, this never had the chance to benefit from a good soundtrack, because it didn't have one.

Another thing I didn't like was the cinematography. It wasn't bad, but nothing ever stood out. There were some nice set-designs, but that's it. A really good atmosphere could have been set up, and it kinda is, but never reaches the potential it had. The movie is also too long. 15-20 minutes could have been shaved off, and it would have been a lot better. The ending itself is good, but the entire third act is too long, and starts to drag. The pacing in general is very slow at the start, very fast in the second act, and slows down at the third. The movie just starts to become boring. I found myself losing interest in the whole psychological aspect because they dragged it out for too long. It's not like I can't handle long movies or slow movies, but they just didn't do a good job with the pacing.

There are somethings that I didn't touch on like dialogue, and that's because the topics I didn't touch on, are things that I don't think are bad, but they aren't great either. Honestly, this movie has lots of great reviews, and it's disappointing to see that it didn't live up to those reviews for me. Maybe it's an acquired taste? I don't know, but what I do know is that I didn't enjoy this movie that much, and I wish I watched something else instead. But I do think that this is something you need to see for yourself to create an opinion. Every movie is like this, but I feel it especially with this, so don't let my negative opinion sway you.",4
25 October 2018,Awesome Fincher atmospheric film.,"Alfred Hitchcock used the term ""refrigerator movie"" to describe certain films. According to the great director, refrigerator movies are well-paced thrillers that work effectively while being watched, but fall apart upon later examination (while ""standing in front of the refrigerator""). David Fincher's The Game is an obvious member of this class of motion pictures. As it's unspooling on screen, the film is hugely entertaining, but there are several significant plot holes that grow wider the more closely they're investigated. Douglas- who is pretty much in every scene is fantastic as the lead. This is a great thriller to watch.

10 February 2010,A Decent Thriller from Fincher. Are You Game?,"In ""The Game,"" Michael Douglas plays Nicholas, a cold and unlikeable investment banker who is in desperate need of a life-lesson. Enter his brother, Conrad, played by Sean Penn. As a birthday present, Conrad sets Nicholas up with a mysterious company that intends to play a high-concept, high-risk game with his life. The end results promise a life-changing experience, but when things get too real too quick and as it gets harder and harder to tell where the game ends and where it begins, Nicholas begins to lose his grip on reality and on himself.

The film, directed by David Fincher (""Se7en"") is a stylish and moody piece, with the director's strong visual sense in full-form. Although the film never quite nails a specific tone (thanks, in part, to its flawed script) it is anchored greatly by Michael Douglas, who keeps us attached to a character who is rather unpleasant on the whole. Along the way, he makes acquaintances with a beautiful waitress (Deborah Kara Unger) and survives gun-fights, car crashes, a trip to Mexico and a fall from a very tall building. Is his life falling apart, or is this just all part of the elaborate game he entered? You can't help but shout at the screen because it is so blatantly obvious where the film is manipulating us. Thus, the film's biggest flaw: It doesn't leave much to the imagination.

Those seeking a well-made thriller will at least find some goodies with ""The Game."" Even if you reach its conclusion before its running time is over, you'll at least remain engaged in watching Nicholas' redemption while Fincher's style makes for an impressive looking film regardless of plot-points. Could it have been better? Sure. Is it an okay way to pass two hours? Definitely.",6

18 March 2022,Way too far fetched,"Watchable, after a very slow start. Sean Penn has never been more obnoxiously unlikable. Douglas is good, in a role that he seems to play in almost every movie. The problem with this movie is that its over-the-top stupid it might as well be a fantasy because the things that happen are totally unbelievable. A cross between wall street and the truman show. I would say it is total garbaggio but its watchable enough that you want to see what happens.

22 May 1999,total waste,"Never seen anything like this movie when it comes to feeling cheated. Halfway through I found myself thinking: this could go two ways, the one way is the most laughable ending I can possibly imagine so I do hope it's going to be the other way. No such luck. ""Congratulations, number one jerk in the world, for what you did to number two jerk in the world"", sums up about all sympathy these characters deserve.

22 February 2004,Great fun little mystery thriller,"This is a top notch mystery thriller, with a suburb cast and great staging. Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are outstanding in their roles as two wealthy brothers, with Sean playing the quirky younger one who gives his elder brother a very unusual birthday present.

The story does play on a lot of modern suburbanite fears of home invasion, being watched, trapped by technology etc. And even if the ending feels a little too neat and implausible, it is really a great ride of a movie with some elegant sophistication thrown in.

24 April 2001,"Don't try to rationalize this movie, just sit back and enjoy the ride......","First of all, I think we can all agree that something like this could never happen in real life. Reviewers who pick apart the various plot points are taking this film way too seriously........For me, it satisfied all my basic requirements........it was unlike anything I had ever seen before, (so it gets several points for originality alone), it held my interest for the entire movie and I thought the actors all did a great job. I was especially impressed with Michael Douglas. I haven't seen him in a while and I had forgotten what a good actor he can be.

Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the movie wasn't as ""creepy"" as I thought it was going to be. The ending was not a big surprise to me (probably the weakest part of the movie), but many of the twists and turns were, so overall I thought it was pretty gripping. I gave it 8/10.

28 March 2004,Play this game,"""The Game"" took me on one extraordinary psychological thrill ride after another loaded with twists and turns scene after scene.

Michael Douglas pulled off one of his best performances as Nicholas Van Orton, a man who is approaching his birthday. Nicholas receives an invitation to play a game given to him by his brother Conrad played by Sean Penn. He reluctantly agrees and soon finds out that the game is more than he bargained for.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film because I never knew who was trustworthy or what was going to happen next, this truly was one film that must be seen by those who enjoy never knowing for sure how a movie will turn out.

""The Game"" is all Michael Douglas and how well he pulls off his role of being the innocent who happens to be in the middle of a game he can't control. However, a really good movie can not be pulled off by one actor, a whole lot of credit should go to the supporting cast that includes Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger for their convincing portrayals in this film.",
15 October 2019,A Genius never can't be predicted,"David Fincher or David Lynch have never dissapointed me, and this movie has not be the exception. Since the beggining to the end I was part of this amazing film. This movie not only played with my mind but also I was part of this game. Seldom has a movie been able to get me stuck on a labyrinth of possibilities. In Summary , an investment banker, Nicholas Van Ortonis, has not keeped in touch with his ex-wife or even his brother for a long time, because apparently the only important in his life is the money. Coincidently his brother give him a unusual gift For Nicholas's 48th birthday, the same birthday when his father commited suicide. This gift is a voucher for a ""Game"" offered by a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Conrad promises that it will change his life. Surprisingly Nicholas contacts the company and he agrees to take a series of psychological tests that ensure the company designs a perfect experience for their needs. After that moment, you won't be able to know what is real, or even if the game at least existed for a second. About the protagonist I can say that Michael Dounglas, lived this game from his unconscious, and I can't imagine a better actor for this Character. Never have I been disappointed for this master, so I invite you to see this incredible film, and on the other hand to stalk as much as you can, all his creations.",9

22 December 1999,A game you must play,"Very few films have the power to manipulate the audience till the end as ""The Game"". It is one of the most inventive, unusual, weird and unpredictable films of the '90s. I just can't understand why it wasn't nominated as best original screenplay on the Oscar, because you don't see films like this one every day.

Once upon a time, there was a millionaire named Nicholas Van Orton. He had everything he wanted, except the company of people- friends, girlfriends, etc. On his 48th birthday, he met his brother in a restaurant and he was given a small gift- a free pass for the CRS. But what was the CRS- The Consumer Recreation Service? Well... He had never heard about it, so he decided to use his pass. After doing many exams in the CRS, some strange things started to happen. Everything started with a wooden clown in his garden, which had a key into its mouth. Then his television started to 'talk' to him. And after that he met a waitress named Christine in the most unusual situations. From this moment on, his life was never the same...

You can't, you just can't find out what comes next in ""The Game"". It kept my attention each second. While it is coming to the end, we think that we know everything, but we don't. The ending was just... Wow! Amazing! I could have never found out that. It was a huge twist, as I just saw in ""The Sixth Sense"". Some people may not be convinced by the final twist, but I didn't mind. After the film ended, I was just blown away. I couldn't think about another thing. It is not THE perfect movie, because there are some scenes that could have been deleted. But I gave it a 9 and I can't give it less than that. Even Michael Douglas surprised me with a very solid acting. And Deborah Kara Unger is just amazing in a great performance.

As I've already said, I don't know why ""The Game"" was not nominated in any category on the Oscar. It really impressed me. Everyone who praised this film was right. David Fincher proved once more that he is a genius. Everything I can say is: play this game...",8

28 April 2000,Constructed and boring,"Yes, I hated ""Alien 3"". And ""Seven"" was the second worst film I've ever seen (the worst was ""Surf Nazis must die""). So, what was I thinking when a friend gave it to me on DVD? ""Well, it's for free.""

What a waste of time! I was not as angry as I was when I left the movie theatre after seeing ""Seven"". Maybe because I expected a ridiculous story, a film only concerned with manipulating its viewers by using hollow effects, where a sledgehammer is a subtle tool compared to them. The director isn't interessted in his characters for a second, so why should we be. Maybe this film was about the changes in the personality of Michael Douglas character. But the director lost focus, seemingly more concered with the boring action sequences.

Yes, the film was boring. Mainly because I couldn't identify with any character, especially not with Michael Douglas' character. How dumb could this guy be? Using his bank passwords on the phone when one of the known ""enemies"" is sitting next to him? Even if not, telling the password on a cell phone? And how dumb did Fincher think his audience is: Maybe not everbody understood, what that burning price tag inside the lamp meant. But I guess everybody knew after he opened the empty fridge. Opening drawings, looking on bookshelves and turning photographs was really annoying.

If you like thrillers where the main character doesn't know who's on his side, don't bother with this flick. Watch ""The Spanish Prisoner"" instead. Yeah, no action there, but characters you are interessted in.",2
28 December 2018,A very original thrill ride that can make you think about what matters in life.,"Some movies have a distinct tone and rhythm, and you just get immersed in them, and it's that proverbial ""emotional rollercoaster."" These are the best movies, in my opinion. The Game is one of those. The music really helps with achieving that immersion.

In the end, it is hard not to go over the movie in your mind, consider if the plot holds together when you finally discover what is happening, and ultimately it does not entirely hold together, it has contrivances necessary to realize this story and requires you to suspend disbelief and/or not think too hard about the plausibility of some sequences. I mean, Forrest Gump made you suspend disbelief about a lot of stuff, but it was also a great movie.

If you consider folk tales, they are stories that have exaggerated or unrealistic or supernatural elements, so you must suspend disbelief somewhat to enjoy them. And we can and do suspend disbelief, and thus we can and do enjoy them. But some movies try to present a plausible reality, like a ""what if this really happened,"" and when THOSE movies cheat with obvious fake and contrived plot elements, it knocks us out of the story and makes for a bad movie. Well, I think the Game and Forrest Gump and Fight Club and some other movies along those lines (maybe the entire James Bond series) are sort of like modern folk tales... If you judge them against realistic dramas or thrillers, their contrivances will seem like a flaw. If you consider them like, say, a Paul Bunyan story, you don't immediately hate it because there's no such thing as a giant blue ox, right? The point is, the Game has contrivances, but only those needed to tell this very subtle and complex folk tale. (I realized Legend of Bagger Vance is probably another good example of this kind of movie.)

The great thing about the movie is that tells the story of a man who has all the material trappings of success, but he's basically a prisoner of his own life, having gotten unknowingly trapped into plodding along like an ox turning a millstone with no way to escape because his own mind is the trap. There's a deep truth here, that people get into their own ruts and opportunities to truly step out of our rut and change direction and gain a better perspective on life, are rare. You watch the movie, see the main character unhinged from his ordinary life to where he can have a transformative moment, and you maybe can have a little echo of that yourself, thinking about your own life, how you might be in a rut and not taking time to appreciate what really matters. That's a pretty big feat, and not many movies can do that.

I saw another reviewer who wrote the movie is good once, but has no re-watch potential, but I completely disagree, and have seen it at least 4-5 times.",9
28 September 2018,A mind numbing train wreck of a movie.,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",3
11 April 2001,A poor effort,"There was something about this film that I really disliked. Maybe it was the storyline (I've never been a huge fan of conspiricy theories), maybe it was the direction, maybe it was the lazy acting on the lead male's behalf, or maybe it was the poor ending. But there was something about it that really didn't appeal to me.

Michael Douglas seemed bored in his role, proving that he can't really cut it any longer as the lead male in an action thriller. All the other characters were hollow and one-dimensinal, the female sort-of love interest being a noteable offender. The film never really seemed to know where it was going, and it never had the sense of urgency to it that thrillers are meant to have.

All in all, there were some nice ideas and sub-plots that, if followed up, could have led to a much more entertaining film. But in the end, it all just built up to a poorly-judged ending, that didn't seem to relate to anything that had already happened.",4
10 October 2001,too good for its own good.,"the game is terrifying, its chilling, the tension in the movie is relentless and its scary. there is no relief and the tension keeps piling on and on, till you reach a point when you say ""i dont care, anymore"". thats when the audience looses touch with the character and plot. i had once heard a critic have a similar complaints against fincher's ""se7en"", i didnt agree with that - but i do with this movie. another fault in the movie is the ending, a little too smart and complicated for its own good.

having said all that, the movie is still brilliantly made, and in-fact for the above same reasons is a stand-out in the otherwise boring hollywood action-thriller genre. david fincher took the lessons from this movie one step further to make the truly brilliant ""fight club"".

i am not much of a fan of michael douglas, he tends to get pretty grating, johnny depp is wasted in the movie. the best thing about the movie is the script and of course finchers deft direction.

16 May 2005,"John, chapter nine, verse twenty-five","All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score.

14 April 2001,Entertaining and clever,"Before I watched this film, I heard some people compare it to the Truman show. First of all the Truman Show has Jim Carrey (a clown 'actor' - his 'acting' abilities are badly shown up here), this has Micheal Douglas, the Truman show is totally boring and unintelligent, this is entertaining and intelligent. In summary the Truman show is rubbish this is again quite the opposite.

I think this film is entertaining from start to finish as an action/thriller intends to be, but avoids all the common action cliches involved of tacky one-liners when something blows up. It also has clever twisting plot, in that it constantly leaves the view wondering whether he's been conned out of all his money and his life, or whether it is 'just a game'. The same applies to the characters involved, you never really sure who's real and who's not. You can also see the point of the game in trying to add excitement to his mundane and seemingly unhappy life, the old chestnut of being rich, but so what? its only money - is clearly present. The direction, acting, set design, stunts etc are all very impressive as well, and most of all the attention to detail.

With all these elements put together I think this is a very good film, one of the best films I've seen made in the late 1990's. (Along with Lock Stock, Snatch, Smoke (1995), and American Beauty). Also note: Traffic is superb, watch it (video/DVD in America, cinema in UK), if you haven't already.

Admitably this film has many 'flaws' plot wise, in that obviously CMS couldn't practically do all the things they did, with the precision they did. But this doesn't necessary mean that the film isn't good nevertheless, we don't know if this is set futuristically - where some of things could be possible, due to technology currently unimagineable. And theres no reason that he wouldn't react the way he did right at the very end, everyone is different - its naive to think he would be angry necessarily rather than relieved.

Although I can see how this film isn't for all tastes, as a sense of realism is essential to some people - maybe the less open-minded and unadventurous audience, who knows? I gave this film 9/10.",9

16 April 2001,A very dangerous game,"To add some spice in his life by participating in a mysterious game, a solitary and blasé business man embarks on a bizarre adventure. One would have expected something a little more exciting from the director of `seven' than this curious psychological thriller, a mix of role play and psychotherapeutic `Surprise surprise', based on a plot which is more cunning than thrilling.

9 November 2002,Silly,"If you're willing to REALLY suspend your disbelief, then this is quite an entertaining film. But some parts are simply impossible such as the newcaster who speaks to him live through the television. That was just plain daft.

At the end I was surprised at how humbly Douglas's character took it. It would have been much better if he had said: ""Oh yeah, it was really funny taking away my dignity like that"", then pulled out a loaded uzi and pumped them all full of lead. That would've been more realistic. Think about it - the man would've been outraged.

18 February 2021,Almost perfect ..but....,"When I watch mystery movie, i tend to guess what is the ending or plot while the movie is playing. There is no exception to this one. I pretty guessed some of the plots.

However at the end, very end, there are twist of the twist which I do not like so much. It is over doing to make it a happy ending which ruin the whole mystery.

Besides the point, what is the logic to the end .. What if the outcome is different, then (to avoid spoiler) the actor (you guess who I am talking about ) actually dies in different way, and how do they know they would try to die that way?!

19 October 2014,What do you give a man whom has everything?,"Our lives are full of memories—some we strive for again, some we try to repress. We often say we're glad the way life has panned out, and then again, wonder: what would have happened? With so many possibilities in life, why not wander and explore? Play a game, perhaps?

Life is not all fun (subjectively speaking) but it is certainly a game we don't expect. Perspective is a strong trait we could all use, since insight always helps—though it may come at a cost.

From the unusual start to the incumbent end, we often wish to go back to earlier times. To not agree to terms unknown. To enjoy the peace that exists in simply being. But it's not enough. Insatiable curiosity is the greatest quality we have, yet also our greatest flaw.

From all the materialistic glamour in the world to the virtues we try to emulate, there is much to both search and cradle in this Universe, and also to learn from. Nicholas van Orton has encountered life-altering moments starting from his childhood up to the ever-changing present. Nonetheless, there is always a void. One we hope to fill.",8
13 August 1999,"A typically modern ""unwise"" story,a ""temporary"" movie.","The biggest of Game's mistakes is its self-undermining storyline.When viewing it for the first time, it is true that a process of intense identification with the Michael Douglas character develops since we cannot but ""live"" his nightmare -although he is presented as an unsympathetic character.However this identification is violently dissolved by the end of the film-which I will not reveal for obvious reasons. The greatest predicament for the picture appears when put under a second viewing;there,identification-free,the viewer finds himself critically distanced from the character's misfortunes (since the ending is so sadly revealing and demythologising)and unhappily put in the position of a cynical observer of a man's adversities without feeling the slightest emotions of sympathy.This definitely presents a problem for a suspense-mystery film that the creator intends. Apart from this failure ,or should I say in addition ,the inadequate script offers minimum evidence of the ""hero""'s redemption and remorse - which are obviously at the core of the narrator's intentions-let us not forget Fincher's obsession with the Christian (or to be more accurate Apocalyptical)philosophical doctrine. The question this film poses, I feel is rather alarming:Why do contemporary filmakers(and it's a pity Fincher,whose Seven is truly one of the finest moments of the decade,awakened this problematic issue),show such indifference to their art's lasting potential? The Game is a movie that could have been better - or even great;its handling ,nevertheless,both by its director but especially by its screenwriters relieves it from that opportunity and condemns it sooner than any of them anticipated.",4
23 January 1999,"In the same mood as se7en, intelligent and thrilling.","Great flick - Michael Douglas is great once again and Sean Penn better not quit acting or I'll send him 10,000 double cheese and sausage pizzas from ""spicoli."" He was great as well. Many twists and a fantastic ending. Same mood as se7en -- does the bad guy win though? See this flick! 9 out of 10.

A psychological thriller that is genuinely mysterious and constantly taking turns at unexpected points. Michael Douglas gives a pitch perfect performance as does Sean Penn, who may not have much screen time but steals every scene he's in.

2 July 2003,"Superb, exhilirating at times","I don't buy the notion that The Game lacks genuine suspense because we do, all along, know it's all just a game. There is a natural flow to the film--if you go along with it, of course--that you have to be willing to get dragged into.

Once you get into that mode then you start to question it - is it just a game? Wait, it really is a game? What if it isn't a game?

I saw this in the theater and totally bought the premise. I let myself get into ""The Game"" and flow with its dynamics and get carried away with it. I think there is an underlying experience that one has to permit themselves rather than overanalyzing the content of the film at the time they're watching it. That may soundly overly simplistic and maybe if this film truly could be carried by its content alone we could approach it from any angle. Even it were ""perfect"", the nature of a movie like this is that there will always be a certain number of skeptics in the audience who will never let go of what it is versus where it wants to take you. I suppose if it were ""perfect"" though even the skeptics wouldn't be able to tell if it was real or just a lie. ""The Usual Suspects"" probably carries this off more believably and resolutely than ""The Game"" does. Still, as for me, my head was buzzing with the exhilaration after seeing it in the theater and I feel a bit charmed to have been able to experience ""The Game"" exactly as it was intended.

And I don't think the ending was really that bad at all. ""The Game"" had to end sometime and, well, how should it have ended?",
14 August 2018,Movie for our paranoid times,"Plot:movie was about the game,which is founded by company and they use this game for fun people.in this game everything was developing strangely.that makes it interesting this movie.also in this game,we saw human's psychology. Goal of the movie is what will happen end of the game. This movie's plus is how directon telling story.you are tense in the whole movie.which is david fincher merit. It's convincingly story but there are some mistakes in the movie.some moments isn't believable. In my opinion this movies's weakness is less dialoges and movies's pace

9 December 2010,"I haven't watched it yet, but I bet it's good. Not Great, but good.","How can I declare that ""The Game"" will be good, but not great, before I have seen it? By reading other people's comments. The common theme of most of these comments is that ""The Game"" is a clever, if outrageous, fantasy driven by fine performances from its stars, Michael Douglas - who I have always found to be engaging and believable - and Sean Penn, who is often very effective, but can also be overly theatrical and oddly self conscious. Somehow Sean manages to convey intense discomfort and boundless confidence simultaneously. It's actually kinda weird. In fact, I find Sean to be a weird person - a curious mix of contradictions and clichés. He rails against the abuse and despoliation of our natural wilderness, but he smokes cigarettes furiously. He demands to be acknowledged as a gifted profound artist, but is keen to develop his persona as an ""everyman."" If he ever manages to stop ""acting"" - whether in a film, or while being interviewed, or on the location of the latest natural disaster - he suddenly becomes powerfully effective, but those moments are few and far between. He too often comes across as self centered and smug. That's a problem with emotionally fragile personalities - they're afraid to just be themselves.

OK, so now I've trashed Sean Penn without having yet seen his performance. No doubt we can all agree that prejudice is a shameful vice, so I should probably refrain from any more blind conjecture, but this is my dilemma. Should I risk 129 minutes of my so very(?!?) valuable time on a Sean Penn vehicle, wagering that I haven't once again been duped into a another frivolous disappointing distraction? It's a risk, it seems, I'm willing to take if the overall experience is something that at least rates as ""pretty good."" If I'm right about my hunch on this flick then I'll leave this comment intact after I watch ""The Game."" If I'm wrong, then I'll add a note correcting my premature condemnation. Maybe I'll be back, maybe not. It's up to Sean...",7

4 October 1999,Smartly crafted thriller,"The Game is the story of wealthy but coldhearted Nicolas Van Orton (Douglas), an emotionally closed off businessman who receives a gift certificate from his little brother Conrad (Penn) which entitles him to play the game, a mysterious game where the player doesn't know what he gets into. Soon there after, Nicolas signs up and gets a lot more than he bargained for as his life takes a turn for the worst. He doesn't know who to trust and who's in on the game. An underrated movie, The Game is smart with plenty of plot twists leading all the way to the shocking climax. Just when you think things have gotten the worst, it gets worse. David Fincher's unique visual style is put on to this excellent thriller. Truly an excellent film. Particularly shocking moments occur after Nicolas is drugged and left for dead in Mexico only to come back stronger. By far, this is one of the best films of 1997 and should've gotten an oscar nomination for best screenplay.

15 September 2017,Depends on what you're into.,"I like this movie but I totally understand why many people were very frustrated with it.

The ability to predict random events and keep driving The main character to a particular destination is absurd. Had it'd been me, I personally would have went utterly mad half way through.

On the other hand, the situations and action are unique and superb.

Great cast of characters and acting.

Like most highly specialized, plots, It's not for everybody.

15 October 2002,One of my 'top ten' favorites: Fincher's best film,"David Fincher's 'The Game' is a surprisingly human thriller. Instead of the 'big thrills' with no thought or care for the characters, Fincher delivers to us a film that has some surprisingly poignant moments, mixed with some real smart 'big thrills'. The film's opening sequence, set to a quiet, somber piano piece sets the tone to a thriller that will impact us emotionally, as well as jerk our adrenaline.

Nicholas Van Orton[Michael Douglas] is bored. He makes sarcastic, biting remarks about his life while at the same time preparing for his 48th birthday, the same age at which his father killed himself. His brother Conrad[Sean Penn] surprises him with a birthday gift, a free membership to a company that, as Conrad says, ''will make your life fun.'' Since he really doesn't have very many other leisure activities and the memories of his father are bothering him, he decides to sign up. What he doesn't know is that 'The Game' may be too 'fun' for him.

The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since 'Wall Street'. Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitressis she a waitress?]. Sean Penn is quite good[in a role meant for Jodie Foster of all people] at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy 'little brother'. The script has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight 'black comedy' feel. As usual in a Fincher film, the cinematography is dark and forebodding and creates a 'noir' atmosphere of sorts. Howard Shore's music is excellent: Instead of attacking us with bombastic chords, a sound as simple as a piano tinkling is used to make our hearts race. The plotting is ingenious and one plot twist after another is instigated until the film creates a spider-web of fear and paranoia that has us mind-boggled. The films themes[of redemption and paranoia] are followed through right to the end in an ending that some think is supremely contrived.

Why? The film has followed its logical course to this destination and fulfills its themes. I personally LOVE this ending and think it is one of the most surprising ones I've seen in recent movies. It twists us around one-hundred and eighty degrees, flips us upside down and leaves our mouths agape in a 'WOW' shape. I ask, 'Is there a better way to end a movie than that?'

I highly recommend this film: it is an astounding. arresting and emotionally exhausting thrill-ride that deserves multiple viewings to fully appreciate...........A true classic..... 10/10",10
17 June 2020,"A game full of twists, turns, and falls","Amazing story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I lived it back in 1997 and it's just as good today in 2020. Well written and well executed. Creepy and suspenseful as well. You have to see it!

25 January 2022,Game or not?,"Don't ask what the purpose of the game is. Finding out is your goal.

Despite a fair share of fantasticism, Fincher's thrillers can't help but like, because they have all the necessary qualities that a wide audience appreciates: great actors, an exciting plot and an unpredictable ending. The third full-length film by one of the best directors of modern Hollywood became a chic example of all his activities and reflected the basic principles of his work with the audience.

""The game"" is a constant tension, a permanent riddle that haunts for two hours, tormenting with its main question: ""Yes or no?"". Michael Douglas as a successful, but tired of life banker, and Sean Penn, who played his brother, who gives his relative a strange and slightly frightening gift...

In addition to the bright dynamics of the film, there is another advantage - the philosophical meaning, which boils down to several questions. What would you wish for if you had everything? And what would you do if they wanted to take it all away from you? One rash decision, and you become a participant in a mysterious game. A series of dizzying events turns your life upside down and transforms the familiar reality, changing the entire scale of values. But you don't believe. It's just a game.

Or not?",10
18 April 2022,Beyond plausible,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",4
28 February 2004,An exciting exercise in impossibility.,"From the beginning of this film to about the last few minutes, I'd have rated it 10 out of 10 on the action level. But overall, the last few minutes of the film dropped that rating to zero. I don't care how many psychological profile tests a person takes, human beings are by and large unpredictable. And, along with that unpredictability is the absolute unpredictability of human beings NOT INVOLVED in 'the game' ... persons whose intervention in the process could have greatly affected the outcome. The plot, overall, was an exercise in impossibility ... a 'game' that, due to the variables, could have had detrimental if not fatal effects on anyone involved (or even people not involved). That, in turn, made the 'game' a highly irresponsible endeavor. If I were Douglas' character, I'd not have felt relieved when the game was finally exposed as just a game. I'd have felt angry and insulted ... and would have distanced myself even further from friends and relatives involved in the process. Far from being a 'gift', I'd have seen it as disrespectful and as an affront.

This movie's theme was an elaborate practical joke played on one character. But, the real practical joke was played on the people who watched it. I can't speak for others but, in my case, I was not amused.",
22 June 1999,Think you're smart?? See THIS!,"I would say, in all modesty, I am a reasonably intelligent filmgoer and yet I felt so completetly, uh...taken by this movie! The Game leads you to believe you've got it all figured out (and perhaps you do?) but then whips around 180 degrees and shows the opposite to be true.

If you're prone to finding yourself scared witless by creepy movies at home alone, rent this one with a friend in the daytime. The Game creates such an acute sense of paranoia it's enough to make anyone scratch their head. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly--until I really sat down and thought about it afterward. In the final moments, something...well, quite traumatic happens to Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas's skillfully played character.) Less than a minute later he is expected to be fully jubilant and recovered. The people who did this to him are supposedly ""good guys"" in the end....and I really can't say any more without revealing the crucial points that make The Game so titulating. But another thing bothered me about the film (okay, besides the plausibility, which the viewer must fully suspend in order to hop aboard The Game.) If this is just a game, and clients like Nicholas shell out big bucks for the ""entertainment,"" if you can call it such, why was Nick almost killed half a dozen times? Later it is revealed that the automatic guns were loaded solely with blanks. Alright, that makes sense, but what about the sinking taxicab scene? If Nick hadn't reacted quickly as he did and saved himself in a bizarre manner, he would've drowned. Such a caring company, eh??? The company CRS was only counting on Nicholas to play the game as expected and save himself in situations like this. True, the personality tests probably gave them a start...but darn it, he still could've drowned!

Alright, now that I worked that out of my system...this is really a fun movie-creepy, mind-boggling, and wholly remarkable--and the rooftop scene had me completely convinced until those doors opened and guess who was really there! The final scene left me with the question, so what's gonna happen next? is it truly over?

Then the credits rolled and I realized it was. I wanted more!",
19 December 2021,Do something else,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",2
4 September 2001,Edge-of-your-seat suspense,"""The Game"" is, to say the least, very, very exciting, despite the...interesting ending that could work for or against it (it worked for me). Michael Douglas is excellent as a snobby rich man who got thrown into a real-life action game that messed up his life. Sean Penn - the reason I saw this movie - is absolutely BRILLIANT as Douglas's ""a little out there"" brother. Too bad he had such little screentime. This movie is really very thrilling. When you think you know what's going on, something totally unpredictable happens and the mystery's back, all over again. Who cares if something like this would never happen in real life! It's a movie! Get over it and enjoy it!

And I defy anyone who claims to have predicted the ending. Whether you liked it or not, it's undeniable that it's, well, unpredictable. Brilliant. Definitely worth sleeping late for.

18 October 2002,"Good movie, worth seeing","I dont see why other users say the end insults the intelligence, etc...

I liked the movie. I think it worth watching for everybody. And if you really like movies, you have to see it. I don't really see it as a movie that you can watch with your family and friends.

You should watch it alone or with someone who like movies and doesn't talk or eat popcorn. Be ready to enter a world where everything isn't exactly what it appears to be and you'll enjoy it.

Bon Cinéma

28 November 2006,This is one of my favorite movies!!!,"Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy bank investor who has everything he wants, still he is unhappy. When little brother, Conrad (played by Sean Penn) promises ""the game"" will fill in what's lacking in his big brothers life, Van Orton finds himself drawn to it. This is a game filled with mysterious events in the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock.

I have seen this movie a dozens of times and I am blown away by it. Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger are superb in their roles and so is the rest of the cast. Director David Fincher did a remarkable job captivating this horrific feeling and atmosphere and I just love it.

This is one of my favorite movies!!!

12 December 2010,The Game is Fun but it Isn't Fincher's Best,"The psychological thriller The Game is directed by David Fincher and stars Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. The film takes place in modern day San Francisco.

Nicholas Van Orten (Douglas) is a very successful business man who lives alone and is very depressed. He used to be married and does not have a very close relationship with his brother, Conrad (Penn). On Nicholas's birthday he remembers how his father killed himself when he turned forty eight. But on Nicholas's birthday his brother gives him a gift that is from a company known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). What this company provides is a game that will control your life and promises a thrilling experience that you've never felt before. But it gets a little bit too thrilling...

John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris wrote the screenplay for this psychological thriller, and it was a little bit too outrageous. It still is a very fun and entertaining ride but it requires you to not think too deeply about what the company needs to be doing for all of this to be happening. I will not go over all the ridiculous things that happen that make this film illogical because there are too many to count, but like I said if you forget about them it is a fun film. Also, this film is purely plot driven, the characters are very one dimensional. In all psychological thrillers there is some sort of twist and in this one there are many as well and they are satisfying, especially the final one.

David Fincher is one of the biggest directors of today but this film was only his third feature and it did not have as much intensity and grittiness as his previous film Se7en. None of the shots in this film were all that impressive, but the sequencing of the shots kept me fascinated the whole way through the film. Fincher grew much as a director since this film and I would even claim that he is one of the best of his generation. But this film is not the reason why he is considered that at all, he became a cult favorite from Se7en and Fight Club then went on to start making more wide spread audience films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and the recent The Social Network. His film repertoire is very impressive and it is enjoyable to see one of his early works such as this film and see how he has grown from it.

Michael Douglas plays the lead of Nicholas Van Orten and even though the character is one dimensional he embodies the role quite well. He sort of plays a sad Gordon Gekko but does not have the great lines that Gekko had. He was very believable in the role but again this is not something that he will be remembered for when talking about why Michael Douglas is a very successful actor.

Sean Penn does not have a major part in this film but he is still in it for a little bit as Nicholas's brother Conrad. When Nicholas and Conrad are running from the CRS and Conrad has sort of a paranoid nervous breakdown Penn is quite good, even though it is nothing compared to the many brilliant performances of his career. When I think Sean Penn I think Milk, Mystic River, and his comedic performance in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, not this film even though he is good, like Douglas.

Deborah Kara Unger plays a waitress named Christine that Nicholas drags into his game. As the film goes on it is hard to determine if she is trying to help Nicholas or if she is working with the CRS. Her performance is alright, but nothing really memorable. I can't even cite a scene in the movie where she was good, it was just her character that was interesting.

Overall I give this film a 6/10, because it is a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the dramatic finale. None of the qualities of the film are great, but they are all decent. I would recommend this to fans of Fincher, psychological thrillers, or I guess dark films with a twist.",6
2 April 2006,"Go Nicholas, it's your birthday...","All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score.

22 November 2000,The Experience Economy,"THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY

In 1999 Joseph Pine and James Gilmore wrote a book, `The Experience Economy.' Their premise was that for businesses to survive they must stage experiences. By way of example they cited the mythical Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) featured in `The Game.' `The Game' stars Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, who is such a cold-blooded capitalist he makes Gordon Gekko (Douglas' Academy-Award winning role in `Wall Street') look like a philanthropist. Van Orton's life consists of watching financial news on the television in his mansion, firing unproductive managers-and obsessing on his father, who committed suicide at age 48. He can barely remember his ex-wife's name.

The movie begins on Van Orton's birthday-his 48th. His ne'er-do-well brother (Sean Penn) gives him as a present `The Game,' and the adventure is on. Before the movie is over Nicholas will be shot at, drugged, impoverished-and that's just the fun part. And even though the movie has been called mean-spirited, in the end he will find a type of redemption and a new direction.

The beauty of `The Game' is in its unpredictability. You never know where the movie is headed. In fact, you're not even sure how the movie ends. As usual, director David Fincher fills each frame with detail and color. He makes even a stock shot of an airplane landing fascinating.

Don't look for a lot of logic here. Roger Ebert talks about the impossibility of Chuck Norris' character crashing a motorcycle into a house at the exact spot he needs to in `Delta Force.' CRS has to do something similar dozens of times in this film, and always is on the mark. And we'd love to know how much Penn would have paid for his brother's experience. The movie teases us with this at the end.

Douglas and Penn have some of their best roles here, and Deborah Kara Unger is fine as a waitress (or is she?) who becomes involved in Douglas' game. But it is character actor James Rebhorn who steals the film as Douglas' operative-or is he?",

29 December 2021,Makes Me Want to Play in This Game,"I loved this movie and makes me wish I was playing in The Game. This film takes you on a roller coaster with non stop action and thrillers. The storyline was incredible and clever. The acting was exceptional, especially by Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Even though Sean has a small role, but his character is important to the film and he nails the role on spot.

I would definitely recommend this film!

6 April 2002,A wonderful movie full of twists and turns!,"""The Game,"" David Fincher's follow-up to his critically hit, ""Se7en,"" was so mesmerising, I had to watch it again after its surprise ending. Michael Douglas gives a knock-out performance as a rich man whose birthday present from his little brother (played by Sean Penn), turns into a cat-and-mouse game that works on many levels and in a good way. The ending really got me. I watched this movie more than once. It was a very well-made, well-crafted film. If you enjoy thriller movies that make you thrill, then you're gonna love ""The Game.""

A+ 13/13 ****** (out of ****** stars)

16 February 2001,Great idea - worse execution,"Wealthy and bored man convinces himself that seeming naive game can turn out to be his worst nightmare. Pretty cool idea for a movie, but execution could be much more creative. Michael Douglas again ('Falling Down', 'The War of The Roses') as a poor loser versus the whole world. Very interesting, very drawing, but ... could be better.

17 November 2022,exciting but unbelieveable,"Saw it once before on late night cable years back and found it only OK then. Revisiting the story now it is too far fetched in his predictiments as total blackout of a hospital, running from an unattended office alarm to getting trapped in an elevator then getting out and running from rent a cops ..why? He has done nothing wrong nor the blond woman partner. I can see the suspense if you get suckered in to the story but I cannot buy it now.

Maybe the story is dated to more than two decades ago but certainly NOT suited for current tastes. To kill an evening with company in front of the TV it might fit the bill but not for a memorable evening.

26 January 2018,"Not the best Fincher, nor the worst.","This is a long way from Fincher's best - but nor is it his worst. It is still better than _Benjamin Button_, with its infinite budget and Kubrick-style obsessive perfectionism.

I don't want to discuss the film content - just what it was. This is like an extended Twilight Zone episode, with twist upon gotcha upon twist. While these were good, they weren't mind-blowing. The best descriptor is ""competent"". As far as his film's go, it's in my second tier of his selections along with _Panic Room_. Competent but not extraordinary. That said, it's still leaps above your typical Hollywood barf. Fincher managed to snag Michael Douglas for this, one would assume on the tails of the much superior _Se7en_from 2 years prior. That's a minus for me - I find it hard to take Douglas films seriously.

But I nitpick. By general standards this is superb viewing for stay-at-home, night in popcorn viewing. It engrosses and keeps your attention. As such I do recommend. But by Fincher standards, it's pretty mediocre, nowhere near the heights he reaches in _Fight Club_, _Zodiac_ or _Gone Girl_. It's still well worth viewing.",7

2 February 2002,Cult Movies 57,"57. THE GAME (thriller/action, 1997) On the day of his birthday millionaire businessman Nicholas (Michael Douglas) is visited by his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) with a gift. The gift involves Nick signing up for a mysterious company which offers a 'game', which in turn offers participants a series of surprises that 'provides whatever is lacking' in their mundane life. Though a rather pessimistic and somber character Nick accepts in hopes of escaping the machinations of a solitary lifestyle. When the surprises the game offers become seriously deadly Nick wants out. But this particular game doesn't seem to offer any escape.

Critique: Nerve-wracking, high-wire act of a movie directed with guile precision by David Fincher. So far all of Finchers' features have been critically as well as financially good, unusual for someone whose concentrated on subversive material. Michael Douglas is good in the role of another heartless business-type in the 'Gordon Gekko' mold. He gives this character just the slight of hand & vulnerability panic that takes him into 'Twilight Zone' territory. It's also good to see Sean Penn in a less character driven role.

Film is made in such a way that every detail and action has an equal surprising reaction. The chaotic yet sequential events reach a climax of implausibility, yet they suck you in with its pervasive appeal. When the credits roll and you know its truly over it is strangely satisfying yet disappointing.

30 July 2016,enjoable,"""The Game"" is truly an intelligent tale, sort of a brain teaser that you get to watch and listen to, with a time limit. You have just 128 minutes to solve this, and chances are, like me, you'll be hanging on the solution to this puzzle until the very end.

The script was well written by a writer who clearly understands the needs of an adult audience. Yes, we like our fun but we like to exercise our brains once in a while also. And let there be no mistake about the great performances offered here by Michael Douglas and his co-stars. I was engrossed by all and couldn't take my eyes of the screen.

Let me just tell you that, as a middle aged film buff, I have seen my share of flicks, good and bad. Very few rate as high as ""The Game"" in entertainment value. ""The Game"" is most definitely one of the ""most fun"" movies to hit the silver screen in a long time. Filled with plot twists and turns, this film takes the movie-goer on a psychological roller coaster ride from the tile screens to the final credit roll.

3 October 1999,David Fincher is a GOD,"I cannot say enough good things about this film or David Fincher's other masterpiece Se7en. What I find so appealing is how unconventional his film making is. It's never predictable and never obvious. Just when you think you've figured it out, he tells you that you're wrong. I know many of will never forgive Fincher after Alien 3, but the movie wasn't as bad as anyone says. It didn't live up to Aliens, but what could? Alien and Aliens are two of the best science fiction movies ever, anything else could barely compare. Also, Alien 3 started shooting without a script. Any good director knows you have to have a solid script before you start something like this, but Fincher had just entered the movie business from the land of music videos and took whatever job he could get. Wouldn't you? He then proceeded to turn Alien 3 into the film the nobody could stop talking about, with a finale that people still have a hard time believing. And that's what he's all about-endings.

The Game was a truly under appreciated masterpiece that got trampled, in part, because it got released in late August-early September and anyone in the movie business knows that release date is just hell. Right after the massive summer and right before the fall Oscar blitz, The Game got trampeled and too many people missed it. It's quite unfortunate, really. I suggest you go and rent it, and tell your friends about this. It deserves more appreciation than it received.",10

4 April 2000,Great thriller,"Alright this seems to be a hit or miss with a lot of people. Most people who dislike it credit that to it being unbelievable or predictable. Or that they felt nothing for Michael Douglas.

I disagree with these comments, probably because I fell for everything. I fell for everything cause I wanted to. It earned my respect from the opening scenes.

It just hit the mark with me from frame one. The footage of Nicholas as a boy with his father with that absolutely haunting music was a brilliant opener.

That music explains everything. The music and this little prologue add more depth to the movie than some movies have in their entire length.

Nobody but Michael Douglas could of pulled this off. He is perfectly cast as Nicholas. He brings so much subtlety to his role. Watch when he is driving in his car talking on his car phone. Watch how he figits and holds the wheel. It fits so perfectly with who is supposed to be.

The build up to the actual game is perfect. Nothing is too abrupt. But once it starts it snowballs into a train ride through hell and doesn't let up until it's fantastic and well suited ending. The plausibility of the logistics of the ending require the viewer to stretch but if you had come along the rest of the way this leap isn't hard to make.

A great movie. One of my favorites. The epitome and definition of a thriller. Suspense, dark tone, mystery. Solid slick movie. David Fincher doesn't disappoint.

Once again great score. Particularly the piano theme in the beginning. Absolutely haunting. The only other movie that used this type of emotionally charged beginning (where the tone is set up in mere seconds) I feel is Jacob's Ladder. Go see that too.",10
17 January 2002,Keeps you on the edge,"Very good, dark & suspenful thriller has a great effort from Michael Douglas in the lead, and will keep you guessing from scene to scene. Truly worth seeing, but I doubt I could watch it again (all the surprises are gone) Highly Recommended.

30 May 2003,A flawed masterpiece,"In The Game, Michael Douglas plays a middle-aged, lonely and slightly bored executive. His brother, Sean Penn gives him a token for the ultimate game experience- not just real-time here folks. Beginning with a bizarre clown and ending with a lot of unanswered questions, The Game is certainly a film that you will be talking about for a long time after the slightly suspect conclusion.

David Fincher creates a tension-saturated thriller here. The murky visuals of The Game experience and the heady visuals of the Clockwork Orange-like introduction sequence to Douglas' game are striking. Sean Penn gives an excellent, if slightly too eager performance as the brother and Deborah Unger leaves a significant impression as the shady Christine. The film excels from the moment Douglas enters the game's headquarters until about five minutes from the end.

This is where the film fails. The joy of a film like this is in receiving a fantastic payoff but this conclusion is far from satisfying. The nature of `the game' is more-or-less revealed at the end, which is fine. However when you realise what has happened it more-or-less spoils the film. The beginning of the movie verges on the dull too, where we are treated to lots of brooding shots of Douglas thinking about his long lost father.

However, ignore the ending and experience the ride there. In this respect, this film is pretty much the best thriller of the 90s.",
10 December 2021,The aim of the game is to find this purpose,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",7
17 February 2010,Hmm,"It's just so baaaad.

Directing doesn't work, script is shoddy at BEST. And I really felt like the acting was quite wooden. Not to mention the fact that the editing has some blatant errors I wasn't comfortable with. And then there's the FAMOUS shot towards the end that displays the protagonist's ""golden nuggets"" full-frontal...

Do not rent. and the DVDs all have added scenes whether you like it or not... and the scenes are gross. There was one moment where I thought I felt excitement in my bosom but then it subsided without release. Actually, my bosom hurt quite a lot afterwards and I had to take a naproxen sodium. Which caused stomach bleeding :(

My favorite actor didn't have enough screen time, besides...

29 April 1999,Entertaining,"This Movie has an interesting and different plot. It is well directed and has a fantastic end. It is nice to see such a different concept once in a while. I would give it 7/10. The atmosphere created by the Director is perfect.

29 April 2017,A Perfect Thriller,"A perfect thriller, from beginning to the end. It doesn't give you breath: action, suspense, mystery, emotion, one of the best movies I've ever seen, with an extraordinary performance of Michael Douglas, who seems that at some point will suffer a heart attack by so much adrenaline. A minute-by-minute changing movie full of surprises for the viewer, who stays in the loop until the end. For my personal taste, a cult movie in the genre of thriller and suspense. Ten points with all letters.

15 December 2000,Fincher is a born director,"This film is a shining example of how versatile David Fincher is, keeping in mind that this was only his third motion picture you have to be totally amazed at just how competently he handles every aspect of this film. His use of characters and actors is second to none, I would have to say this is the best performance from Michael Douglas that I have seen in the past 10 years. I feverishly look forward to more fantastic films from David Fincher and can only pray to God that he releases a directors cut of Alien 3 so it can be seen the way he intended.

21 May 2005,Twisting the twist,"The reason to watch this movie was Michael Douglas (Nicholas Von Orton) and no problem there as he made a very strong performance throughout. He just doesn't know what's going on as I didn't. Every 10 minutes the story gets a twist and says that all things previously seen are fake, now is the moment of the truth. Then in another ten minutes, again and again and again. In fact, in the end I got a bit tired of this and the constant change was not so entertaining. I watched the last 20 minutes only for sake of curiosity, to know what will be the final solution, which was original indeed. I think less twist would have been more, with more development of Nicholas' character, description of the plots. That way it would worth a second watch for me, this way it was just a fast moving funny action movie.

About the idea of 'The Game' - funnily the movie started me to think after a bit - this whole idea is so strange for me. First, it is so awkward that you need hundreds of people and millions of dollars and an incredibly strong impact on your personality to make you a shock and discover 'where life is' and come back to reality. Second, when you constantly discover, that everything previously experienced was a setup, when you showed true emotions and reactions others were just playing around you, when killing your brother was a fake and even your own suicide was a fake - then I think to loose ground and simply my personality would crash. I would no longer be able to trust anyone and any experience because I would constantly doubt whether this is part of a setup or is this 'real'. Authenticity is very important to me in my personal relations, and when someone plays with emotions and trust, all I can do is to let my walls fall build up suddenly, put on my mask, and keep all authentic feelings and reactions inside, and just give a smile to The outer world. Living such a way for a long time would be really a nightmare for me.

However, I like the idea of Mother Theresa and Sai Baba, who said ""Life is a game. Play it."" - though the words are similar, somehow that is such a different approach to life than what is presented in the movie ""The Game"".",7
13 April 2020,Best movie ever ever ever,"For those who like and appreciate the script and the thrills of a movie,this is definitely a movie that will leave you with an open mouth at the end! You will never guess what is happening!!!

24 June 2000,Super-dupa,"What a fantastic movie, inspired even. It doesn't seem that interesting at first glance and the set-up is a little slow but after that, when Douglas's character goes to CRS to start his 'game' the film immediately hits top gear and is brilliant right up until the end. The genius behind it is that, unlike some other psychological thrillers like Perfect Blue et al, you know what's going on and what the current state of play is but you have no idea how it's going to end or whether CRS really are out to kill him. The pacing from Conrad's invitation on is perfect and to see the way Michael Douglas's in-control businessman is turned inside our by what he sees as 'depraved children' is very engrossing. It's difficult to put into words just how great this film is without getting my words into a tizz or giving away the plot. Needless to say everything about it is fantastic from the acting to the beautiful script to the hugely atmospheric photography. Brilliant, get it out, love it, buy a copy, love it some more.

I had seen it sitting there on the dollar movies for quite some time and one day was like what the hay. I took it home and a few days later watched it and loved it.

This movie has you gripped and then at the end has an ending I did not see at all. Go see this, pretty good! 8/10

1 July 2012,Very Original,"This movie has so many plot holes you could drive a Mack truck through but, it is brilliantly entertaining.

I watched it on TV tonight with casual disinterest, but Michael Douglas does the Gordon Gekko thing so well that I stuck with it and found myself caught up in the whole scheme of things. Those of you that don't care for MDs acting, might change your minds with this one. He really is very good.

This is really very good entertainment but does require attention. It is impossibly far fetched but at least does not to imitate science or history badly like Avatar or Prometheus, in todays cinema world.

I once had the same BMW as MD drives. It was a lemon and cost me heaps.

Drive a Nissan these days.",8

6 June 1999,A roller coaster of a ride with a soft landing,"I can't believe that some people could actually compare the film 'Sliver' to this great film. There are no comparison, The Game is an excellent film, with good characters. Michael Douglas was great in this, I really felt what he felt. I could understand his fear. The last scene on top of the building is one of the best I've seen. The darkness and Gothic styles are used to great effect.

Of course, there are minor details that cross the reality line, but hey, it's entertaining nevertheless. If you keep putting your intellect into every film you see, then you might as well watch Discovery Channel.

This is a great piece of escapism, with an unusual ending. I highly recommend this film, for those who are looking for something different...

25 May 2001,Amazing,"After I watched Fight Club, I never thought I would ever see another movie of comparable quality. The Game is of comparable quality.

Usually, I am able to figure out movies well before the ending is revealed, but I was completely engaged for the duration - trying to figure out this one. If you have not yet seen this film, you had better.

26 November 2001,Not fully convincing,"As always, Fincher proves to be a very innovating, intelligent, risk-loving director. There are many very good moments in this movie, and it is, over long periods, simply thrilling. But this makes the end and its flat morality even more annoying. Fortunately, the disturbing power of the previous sequences is strong enough to let you not COMPLETELY ""satisfied"", but the INTENTION to satisfy (and calm) you is obvious. The last 10 minutes are a shame, let's face it. In my opinion, ""Seven"", although or because less ambicious, remains the best of Fincher's three famous movies.

5 June 2016,The Game review,"The Game is a film starring Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a successful businessman who receives a gift from his brother Conrad Van Orton (Sean Penn) for his birthday. The gift was a certificate for a program, a program called 'The Game' little did Douglas know it, this Game would change his life forever. The Director David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club) did a fantastic job in this movie. The whole film was so captivating, and Douglas' performance was one of the greatest i've seen. It was such a different, and interesting concept of a film, it was definitely one that was always stay with me after seeing it. With fantastic twists and turns throughout the whole movie, and great supporting performances from Penn, The Game is a real treat! I tend to love everything that Michael Douglas is in, he hasn't done any film i've seen where he didn't give an amazing performance. One of his most memorable performance was from Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street' as Gordon Gekko. That was a brilliant performance, but in my opinion, his performance as Nicholas Van Orton stands higher up the rank. Don't miss the game! One of the most well- thought psychological thrillers of the 90s.",9
26 March 2001,Mind-blowing,"This is such a great movie, it keeps you guessing to the end. All of these people raving about the twists in movies like 'The Sixth Sense' need to have a reality check and hire out this classic. The formula seems simple enough, take a middle aged business man with too much money and not enough time, make him part of a game that seems to be innocent enough but quickly becomes out of control, plunging his life into a nightmare of events that he can't escape, or can he??? Not so simple, anymore. Just when he thinks he's on top, the rules of the game change, leaving him wondering just who is one step ahead of who??? In the end, it is the audience who is left reeling. A must see for those of you with a taste for your more intelligent movies. Plus, Michael Douglas is in it, and that usually says a lot about the quality of the film.

1 July 2005,"Brilliant directing, flawless acting, fine point-at-hand, yet so unsatisfying.","Well... what can I say? The movie gets a stellar grade of 7 out of 10, because the acting, directing, editing, music, and cinematography were all very well done. However, despite a genuinely suspenseful thriller that was 'The Game,' I can't help but feel frustrated at the conclusion to the whole ordeal. There are countless instances in which the main character, and the subject of the deadly ""game,"" acts abruptly upon whatever trouble finds him, yet is lead to believe that the game-makers, a company called CRS, knew exactly what his actions would be. When viewing the film, one is almost certain to, at some point in the movie, ask themselves: how could they REALLY have known Nick (the main character) was going to do that. I can only suggest to see it for yourself, though I can, and will, do so with a high recommendation.

16 April 1999,Just not enough,"The Game is by no means a bad movie, but it isn't particularly good, either. Oh, I admit that it has some nice acting and intriguing plot twists, but the whole film has a very confusing feel (yes, I know that's on purpose, but that doesn't make it good). The main reason I saw it was because I'd heard the ""huge shocker"" ending would leave me breathless and make me want to watch it all over again. While I won't spoil the end, I do need to say that it fell FAR short of my expectations. It felt rather tagged-on, a disappointing end to a mediocre film.

20 November 2001,"The Game illustrates the theory or truth, depending on ones' viewpoint, that life is just a game (""All of life is a stage and we are but the actors"" - William Shakespeare).","From a spiritual and/or philosophical viewpoint, The Game illustrates many truths, more truths than untruths. Therefore, it can be classified as a ""teaching movie"", meaning that it illustrates truths which already existed prior to its production. Or, stated another way, it is fiction with a purpose.

It deals with the breaking down of the human ego in order to locate truth. The main character was not seeking truth, therefore, it was his time or his destiny/fate, spiritually and philosophically speaking.

From a religious/spiritual standpoint, John 9:25 was cited within the movie, ""Whereas once I was blind, now I can see"". Like the movie ""The Matrix"", the main character is working with what can be considered a spiritual team, headed by what can be considered an Angel of Death. At the end of the movie Nicholas asks Claire if she is off to sheer some more sheep. She replies that ""It's just a walk-on this time"", meaning that his (Nicholas') induction into reality was a ""drag-on"" as opposed to a ""walk on"". His number was up, so to speak.

The main reason that his number was up was due to his intense fear regarding his father's suicide at age 48, which is the age Nicholas finds himself at in the beginning of the movie and the fact that he might be destined to follow in his father's footsteps, or cursed in that respect, if one believes in curses. Nicholas' other fears were addressed also. Regarding fear itself, there is a passage in the Christian Bible by one of the prophets which states, ""What I have feared the most has come upon me"". Metaphysically, fear begets fear or like attracts like. Another good reason to confront fears and walk through them before they walk through us.

Nicholas died at least once in the movie (woke up in a grave in Mexico and received a T-shirt stating that fact, later, from his brother).

There are several consciousness dimensional shifts illustrated in the movie, the first being as Michael Douglas as Nicholas entered the airport to travel to Armin Mueller-Stahl's character's location to fire him.

The movie depicts Nicholas' humbling process in an excellent manner, focusing on his manipulation and control tendencies and his self-centered advanced state of egocentricity as well as his fears.

The movie additionally depicts and confirms immortality of the human spirit as well as alternate realities, worlds, universes, existences.",10

24 November 2001,Is it really just a game?,"When watching this film, one is mesmerized by the potential improbabilities of the plot. The timing, the events, the vast conspiracy... or is it a conspiracy? We just don't know. There are hints along the way that take viewers from one side of the spectrum to the other. Just when you think you've figured it out, another plot twist is thrown at you. ""The Game"" is an intriguing cinematic experience and Michael Douglas plays his role very well. Sean Penn was also convincing. At it's essence, ""The Game"" is a modern, urban, corporate America version of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but the difference is that there are no kind angels guiding Michael Douglas' character around... at least not in an obvious way. He's ostensibly isolated and possibly on his own, taking us along down a confusing and difficult journey. If you see this movie, and you should, don't do so unless you stick with it through the final 10 minutes, because therein lies the explanation for it all. Without those final minutes, you haven't seen this film. This is not ""Sixth Sense"" but much, much better. An intriguing 9/10.

31 May 2000,A Non-Stop Action Ride,"Personally, I loved this movie. From beginning to end, it is a wholly engrossing film, one that is extremely under-rated, in my opinion.

It is the story of a wealthy financial player who is very arrogant, egotistical, and withdrawn at the same time. As his birthday present, his brother buys him a gift certificate from a company called Consumer Recreation Services. This company provides an experience to the customer, ""the game"", which is different for everybody, and very mysterious. The film is a non-stop action ride through 2 hours of plot twists, backstabbing, and surprises. Once the game begins, Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) must see it through to its shocking conclusion.

Michael Douglas is excellent as the ice-cold Van Orton, and Sean Penn does a superb job playing his brother, Conrad. Deborah Unger, who also appears in director David Cronenberg's ""Crash"", also plays her part very convincingly. In all, this movie shouldn't be missed, and should be viewed with an open mind.

My Rating: 10/10",9
4 December 1999,Wouldn't it be fun to have Psychosis?,"Do you enjoy movies that keep you guessing until the very end? A movie that each time you view it, you get more insight and discover new things? This is that movie and in my opinion is very under-rated. This is an intelligent psychological thriller and an excellent film disguised as a cookie-cutter Hollywood no-brainer. It has big stars and a big budget but is in no way conventional. If you've seen Seven or Fight Club you know what I'm talking about. The filmmakers obviously know how complicated their plot gets and take their time. The pace of this movie is the greatest part, slowly unveiling itself and taking us along with main character deeper and deeper without losing us. This was reminiscent of The Spanish Prisoner, another under-rated film that kept you guessing until the end. Great story and keep your eyes on David Fincher

29 August 2021,"Dull, boring and pointless!!!","Plot The story revolves around a multimillionaire banker who is exhausted in work, and is emotionally distanced from his family and any personal relationships. He receives a strange gift from his brother on his 48th birthday, which he has to drop by a company called CRS to take few tests to apply for a ""game"" to be designed for him.

From here the story takes turns and life starts to change where he finds himself chased and troubles begin.

OPINION After 40 mins into the movie I decided to not continue anymore because of how boring and eventless for almost an hour, and then I decided to give it another shot and this is one of the few times I regret doing it. This movie deserves to be labelled sick on Netflix, the idea behind all what happened is very shallow, and as long as you keep watching the second hour starts to have action when it hits you just 30 before the ending that a cartoon has more to tell. The ending is horrible, and the idea of making a 2 hour movie based on nothing is just annoying. You can add to the mess the terrible production, shooting, editing and the dark lighting. Even the important scenes are redundant with zero creativity, the scene which he rides his car talking on the phone happened almost 5 times. The story had a strong emotional part about the death of his father which was totally neglected, don't know why they even mentioned it? Although the film is very engaging at first with the flashback and the music but the cold acting just ruins it all.

What surprises me is this movie has a high rating of 7.7, plus the director and the music producer which definitely should end in a good movie, yet no doubt it has zero awards or nominations.",5
30 August 2011,Let down only by its ending.,"The Game is another one of those very fine examples of style over substance. There are great action set pieces, some slick dialogue, some sparkling acting and some fantastic direction from David Fincher. But, in the end, where does it really lead? Not really anywhere. Fortunately for this film, because there is so much going on, you can afford to forgive the ending.

Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) is a cynical, detached banker. He has an ex wife he takes no notice of. He has a brother who is clearly disturbed and he has to live with the knowledge that his father committed suicide in front of him. He lives only to make business deals and cares only for money.

That is, until his brother gives him a birthday present - a ticket for something known as 'The Game'. Reluctantly, Van Orten signs up to this game, little realising that he's opening up a total nightmare. Soon, he is apparently the victim of fraud, his house is broken into, there are attempts to kill him and his brother is apparently committed. Van Orten is left to try and solve everything himself, using only his wits and whatever sense is left in him.

Make no mistake that this film is worth watching. For several exceptional reasons. Firstly, the script and in particular the dialogue is pretty sharp with some cracking action and some good dark humour. Secondly, David Fincher directs this with his usual talent for dark atmosphere and slick action. There are some exceptionally good action scenes and some carefully crafted talk scenes that always move the film forward at breathtaking pace. Finally, the acting it absolutely outstanding. Every part in this film is cast as perfectly as possible. Michael Douglas shines in a role that he is always so well suited to. Sean Penn, someone I'm not usually keen on, adds real paranoia and depth to his scenes, and the two leads are then supported by several very talented character actors that give more than the film gives them in return.

The problem here is the ending. It's not all that believable, and feels more like a last minute cop-out because they were either nor sure how to end it, or were too afraid to make it even darker. The ending isn't just unbelievable - realistically it's not possible. After suffering all that he does throughout the film, there's little chance that Van Orten could take that one final twist. He'd either be insane, or a broken man. Instead what we get is something a little too happy, and not dark enough for the rest of the film.

However, ending aside, this film is very, very good. I'd still recommend it, even if just for everything up until the ending, the first rate acting and the atmospheric and slick directing.",
4 November 1999,A mind-grinding suspense filled with sadistic & cruel entertainment!,"Watching a mouse get through a labyrinth may be interesting, but subjecting a successful human to a similar maze of cruel situations is sadistic. If you enjoy watching others suffer, you will love this movie. I personally found the plot simple, but cruel, and not the best way to become entertained. I questioned myself often, ""Why do people find this plot to be entertaining?"" This film is an excellent teacher for psychologist students to witness the extremes that people go to, for teasing and tormenting of the human spirit. One can easily see the despair of the lead character, and see that the tormenter had no compassion. I concluded the lead character,himself, didn't possess compassion.

There is little in this film that could make a viewer feel good. It is just a ""gang up on a victim and torture 'em senseless"" film.

Definitely not suitable for tender or youthful minds.

23 August 1999,Sit back and enjoy the ride,"Entertaining vehicle for Micheal Douglas (who appears in virtually every shot - but doesn't get to bed the leading lady this time). Sean Penn appears for about 5 minutes in all - which is just as well really since he has no charisma - why is he famous?

The plot had an opportunity right up to the last few minutes to round itself off to an excellent black comedy - film noir type conclusion, but the seemingly inevitable hollywood-style feel good ending had to be tacked on, which relegates the film to trivial entertainment - bad move Mr Producer.

However, watch it - and don't think about it too deeply.

19 December 2002,Another Fincher success!,"A middle-aged workaholic millionaire (Douglas) is , for his for his birthday, given a gift that casts him as a participant in a mysterious game that turns his life upside down.

This is a high-energy paranoid thriller that plunges its protagonist, and the audience, into a world where nothing is to be trusted; the result is some dazzling sleight-of-hand.

It boosts good performances from it's leads and great direction from David Fincher, and you will not be dissapointed with this gem of a movie.

2 May 2013,Just A Silly Game,"** SPOILER **

Is it possible everybody in this movie was ""in on it"" ? Every accident, every ""death"" was staged. There was no deep rewakening, just a lot of silliness. Some how after 1.5 hr of phony plots, I wish Sean Penn and the lawyer were really in an evil plot to take over Mike Douglas's business empire. The film is well-made which is a waste; you'd get tired after seeing everything was a spoof. Who is being made fool here? Example of this silliness would have Mike Douglas jumped off a sky scraper after another staged scene, thru a cathedral glass ceiling,onto a marked landing balloon to the applause of an awaiting dinner party. Of course, they know the exact spot Douglas will jump and therefore aligned the landing perfectly.

Find some other more intelligent game to play.

30 September 1999,Love that multilayered stuff,"Great movie, although quite disturbing in a number of ways, beginning to end. Psycho concept. That song ""White Rabbit"" by Jefferson Airplane had a totally different significance to me after watching this movie. Suspense effect is great. Deliciously nightmarish and scary.

Some of the situations aren't perfectly developed, and the ending just makes you go... well, *@#$. And you're kind of mad for a minute, and then you rethink everything. And I just eat that kind of stuff up. Very creative movie.

19 July 2020,Above Average Thriller,"Ultimately the message is actual a good and relatively (psychologically) deep one. It takes A LOT to get through this movie though- both in terms of anxiety and disbelief. Wasn't satisfied with the ending immediately, but upon reflection it is better than the average thriller.

13 January 2008,A must for Hitchcock students,"The Game is a non-stop homage to Hitchcock, from the never-quite-modern San Francisco milieu to the symbolic doors, windows, mirrors, stairs, glass shards, blood, to the clueless man on the run from inexplicable evil, to fake falls off very high places to lifeless mannequins propped up in chairs.

Check the suggestive sign that lights up behind Michael Douglas as he moves to look down a subway staircase (which is really stairs from a bridge to the street) with a phone (and weird derelict) at the bottom; then a split edit with phone ring audio leading that cuts to Douglas answering a quite different phone. Consider the lyrics of the Jefferson Airplane/Grace Slick ""White Rabbit,"" which appears in the film and is reprised in its entirety over the end credits.

Like every Hitchcock movie, The Game is, itself, a game: thoroughly engrossing when you're playing it, but obviously preposterous when you think about it five minutes later. If playing the game of The Game(and spotting all the Hitchcock tropes) is for you, you'll have a blast. If you're irritated by the wildly implausible (and even downright impossible), go watch a documentary.

If you fall in between, as I did, give in to the chase (BTW, the R rating must be solely for some F-- words: there's no explicit sex or violence) and enjoy the show. A great film it ain't; but for high class Hollywood production, it wins in every category.",7
7 June 2002,Emotional,"I would agree that in real life, no one can predict what Van Norton would do or would not do in response to the situations thrown at him.

But the double shocking endings was very emotional for me. I can feel Van Norton's heartbreak after doing what he did to his brother.

Absolutely the best ending I have witnessed, in any movie.

5 March 2001,WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH!!,"I saw this film on TV the other night, and am only glad that I didn't pay to see it at the cinema. A few points worthy of note:

Just 'cos a film's directed by David Fincher doesn't automatically mean it's a masterpiece. He's managed to acquire an undeserved reputation as a Hollywood ""wunderkind"", endlessly praised by 22-year-old film-school graduates (or ""readers of Empire magazine"", as they're more commonly known), who think that films shot with lousy lighting and lots of rain are just soooo original (see Fight Club, Seven, etc.).


Why is the plot such a copout? The film would surely have been far more impressive if it had stuck to the abstract idea of Michael Douglas being subjected to the Game for the sheer hell of it - I know it transpires in the end that the Game was the whole point, but in the meantime it degenerates into a confused hour-long car chase.




So there you go - The Game is over-rated, over-hyped, over-praised, and way over the top. Plus, while we're being all arty and filmy, the innercity scenes looked like they were heavily ripped off Martin Scorsese's under-rated 1985 film, ""After Hours"":if you haven't seen it, watch it - it knocks The Game over and TRAMPLES on it!!",
25 April 2021,Amazing progress throughout the movie,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",7
24 July 2001,you're so lucky if you haven't played THE GAME yet...,"For those who haven't seen the movie yet...I envy you greatly. You don't know what awaits...

A very successfully built tension and mystery, accompanied by dazzling scenes and continuous surprises...Just when you think you've figured it all out, you realize you're on the wrong track. You reach lessons, you think ''don't trust anyone, not even your brother. Always consider your enemies. Beware of complete strangers''. You think ''be more careful before taking a road which you barely can see, which you barely know about''. But is it really what the film says? You wonder...so, just play the game and let it flow. Don't listen to what others say. Follow what your mind says. But will you be so lucky to escape? With no wounds? With no regrets?

Are you haunted by your past? Does history repeat itself? Or is it all a set-up? Innocent, or guilty?

I don't want to go further...Just sit back and enjoy. Don't be too quick to decide...With the gloomy atmosphere increasing the number of question marks in your head, great scenario, immensely successful direction by Fincher as always, and Sean Penn strengthening his place among my all-time favorites, a 10/10 for me.",10
27 January 1999,WoW!!!!,"Yes, Yes I have heard it all. This one movie kept you guessing, this one made you think this guy did it, and this one made you think he was the master-mind. Yea, yea.

Trust me, if you like movies that keep you guessing-this is the one....so far!

16 February 2000,The Game definitely worth playing.,"A fascinating, original absolutely pitch perfect thriller that is mysterious, suspenseful and rich in character. Michael Douglas stars as a successful business man celebrating his birthday. As a gift for ""the man who has everything,"" his brother (Sean Penn) gives him a ticket to a corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Reluctantly Douglas follows his curiousity to CRS and after filling out a lengthy questionaire, undergoing a rigurous medical examination and disclosing personal information about himself, he is told that his game will begin soon. Almost immediately afterwards strange things start happening. Things that seem so real that Douglas begins to question if people are actually trying to set him up, or if it is all just a game. His life is threatened multiple times, he meets a beautiful, mysterious woman with whom he becomes involved and the plot takes a series of roller coaster dives until it reaches it's shocking conclusion. Many people were unsatisfied with the ending of the film, possibly because there is no clear expectation generated by the midsection. But I feel that it is suitable and just. The Game is a thriller that thrills, and it doesn't sell out for cheap violence, sex, or explosions (although it has a little of all these things). It is a masterful film that demands multiple viewings, tautly directed and cleverly scripted. One of the best thrillers of the 90's!",10

7 January 2002,Fincheresque,"In true David Fincher style we're taken for a ride that defies commonsense and yet is fun. Michael Douglas is a wealthy but unhappy man, who's only outlet is watching CNN moneyline and firing people. That is until, his brother decides to wake his inner feelings up again by asking him to play a game. What is this game and how it plays is what the movie is about.

If you think too hard and try to analyze too much, you won't like it. It's not complaint with the normal commonsense rules. Just put yourself in Michael's shoes and you'll enjoy it.

A recommendation: Watch in complete darkness.

14 August 1999,Game Review - from Average Man Critic,"Story -1. One of the richest men in America receives a certificate for a personalized gaming service. But as the game begins to get more dangerous, we have to wonder whos playing who. Excellent.

Characters -1. Nicolas Van Orton is the main character who goes through a series of changes as the movie progresses. In the beginning he is a ruthless and cut throat, easily disliked by the audience as just another rich snob with no morals. Then as the Game unfolds he no longer is ""untouchable"", he is a hunted and scared man, sleeping at bus stops and begging for money. At this point we feels sorry for him and see that he is a human being. And by the end... well you have to see it to find out.

Acting -1. Douglas gives the best performance of his career since Wall St.

Cinematography -1. The dark look of the film was excellent and symbolic of Douglas's trip into the unknown. When we are alone in the dark we feel vulnerable and we don't know what is ahead of us.

Beginning -1. I like the 8mm video of Van Orton's life when he was a child. It set the tone for the movie.

End -1. UNBELIEVABLE! What a mind trip! I loved it!

Mystery/Thriller -1. It fit its genre perfectly. It will have you guessing and at the edge of your seat the entire way through.

Attention Holding -1. Absolutely. From the time movie begins you don't want to move or even blink.

Memorable -1. NOBODY can forget the game. Especially the end.

Could Watch Again -1. I own it on DVD and I watch it again and again even though the end does not have the same impact.

Game = 10. I LOVE this movie. Any person who likes to be taken on an adventure should see this film, you won't be disappointed. I can't wait for the Criterion Edition on DVD.",
19 January 2000,A great suspense film,"This is the suspense movie I have most liked. It keeps you stuck to the chair right up until it ends. The actors do a great job. But, befere you see it, don't let anyone tell you what is it about! You'll lose the entire movie!

18 November 2018,Finishes strong,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",7
7 July 1999,Fincher comes of age...,"""The Game"" is a true throwback to one of my favorite film sub-genres, the seventies conspiracy film, in all the ways a silly cartoon like ""Conspiracy Theory"" could not be. Richard Donner directed that juvenile exercise, and, along with the main actors, you know it's just a pretender.

""The Game,"" however, is slow and deliberate, and Fincher lays a network of plotting that Donner couldn't handle on his best day. The film could easily be criticized for being an expertly crafted thrill-ride, too air-tight to live, but I disagree - as far as I'm concerned, the picture has more life in it than anything that came out in 1997.

Fincher knows this film's roots. ""The Game"" climbs the ladder of mounting paranoia with classic, unstoppable footsteps. It is quiet, like ""All the President's Men"" (and shot in a lot of parking garages, like that film). It even features a psych test similar to the one that Warren Beatty takes in ""The Parallax View."" The ever-mounting dread resembles that found in ""The Conversation"" (along with a distinctive toilet homage to that film).

The only thing different from those great films of the '70s (ones both mentioned and not), is how it all ends. Missing is the cynical, nihilistic ending, which was the best part of Fincher's ""Seven"" and many of this film's inspirations (stuff like ""The French Connection,"" ""Winter Kills,"" etc.). Fortunately, for buffs of this type of thing, the story has dived about as far into the depths as it could go before things suddenly lift (but not in a contrived way - as a matter of fact, things here are SO contrived, they transcend all that makes the practice so dull!).

Michael Douglas has his best performance (and role) in a long time, and Fincher has proven himself with his third feature, taking a wonderfully inspired screenplay and rising to its level. The best of its kind since ""JFK,"" and my second favorite film of 1997.",10
25 July 2020,Witty! Intense! Unpredictable!,"Just watched this movie and realised how amazing a director David Fincher is! He is so good at these intense psychological movies that keep you on the edge. The cast & their performances are excellent. The writing is fantastic and add to it the excellent background score and you have yourself a solid entertainer. The ending was unpredictable and the perfect climax the audiences could have asked for. Definitely worth every second.

10 November 2002,Don't believe the hype,"As usual, Fincher's darkly stylish themes are to the fore - in lesser hands this could have been a disaster. But ultimately, the far-fetched ending lets it down: it's like one of those elaborate jokes which go on for twenty minutes only to have a punchline like ""Rudolph The Red knows rain, dear"". To suggest, as have some comments below, that this is Fincher's best work is an even bigger joke. It provides an interesting segue from 'Se7en' into 'Fight Club' but is certainly inferior to both. Compare and contrast with Scorcese's 'After Hours'.

31 July 2012,"If you want to start watching Fincher film, this is one to start on.","The Game is the story of Nicolas Van Orton, played by Michael Douglas, who is a wealthy financier and gets a birthday present from his brother, played by Sean Peann, which is a live-action game which consumes his life.

I really like David Fincher. He's a great director and his films are brilliant - Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network. - And I really enjoyed this one. Very good acting, moved along at a nice pace, it wasn't too long or it wasn't to short and it had me guessing what would happen all the way. When one twist happened, another came around the corner.

So I really enjoyed this film for what it's worth and David Fincher is brilliant behind the camera. The acting was great, directing, well- written. I really enjoyed it. Defiantly recommend it to anyone who is a Fincher fan, or who wants to start watching Fincher films because it isn't his best, but it's really good and that says something.

20 November 2001,"So, what is going on? (8/10)","This is just one of this movies. You will probably either love it, or hate it. But you have to admit, David Fincher (the Director) knows what he is doing. Seven and Fight Club are two other movies from him. He is one of the most visual directories of Hollywood. The acting is also quite good.

The thing about this movie though, is that you should just go and see it. I knew a tad bit to much, so I couldn't quite let it go. I anticipated the ending (but didn't completely figure it out). To really enjoy this movie, you have to try to get Nicholas' (Michael Douglas) point of view. That's all you'll get out of me.

By the way, watch out for blue colors. It's typical for David Fincher movies. All in all I give this one 8/10. It's not as good as Fight Club (but some people may disagree).

2 September 1999,Add to your collection,"For anybody who likes a surprise ending and a well acted movie, The Game is a movie you will want to see.

While The Game is not something that is likely to ever happen in the real world, its still interesting.

I would like to see a movie like this about Corporate America. You know. With all the back-stabbing, ladder climbing, and ass kissing that goes on in the tall building one can never really tell who they can trust or who really has your interests in mind when they give you advice.

Well, The Game has a lot of surprising twists and turns and a very good ending.

9/10 I should have given it a ten. The entire cast acted very good with one exception -- Deborah Unger was great.",9
4 December 2003,A One-of-a-Kind Thrill Ride!,"""The Game"" is the one of the best thrillers of 1997, and of all time. Director David Fincher (Se7en) has created a suspense thrill ride without the help of

Hollywood: a very impressive achievement. The acting is great, the screenplay is great, but its most impressive trait is its ending. What happens? See the movie to find out! Trust me, this is a one-of-a-kind thrill ride!

My Critique: ***+

Rating: [R]

Rating Reasons: Language, and some violence and sexuality.

26 November 2006,Wonderful photography,"We all know that certain aspects of ""The Game"" are impossible but who cares its a movie. I was floored by the photography of the movie. The darkness in the movie is clearly used as an art form. Much like an artist working with their color pallet, which would include blue, black, and various shades of grey. The film demonstrates a washed out appearance which adds to the overall mood of the film. Even the film grain adds edge to the film. The lighting adds unbelievable ambiance to certain character scenes/interactions. For example some of the kitchen scenes with Michael Douglas. The sound brings the film to an unbelievable level. Especially the kitchen scene where Michael Douglas gets his birthday dinner. Everything is so loud and has a major echo within the kitchen. This is a perfect example of demonstrating the loneliness in his life. Even down to the song ""White Rabbit"" adds to the overall ""Alice in Wonderland"" confusion of the movie. Finally the echoing piano gives the movie a somber feel, a feeling of loneliness. It also adds to the overall chaotic feel of the movie. Never fully engaging in a orchestra at times but just a single instrument dictating the mood of the movie. Unbelievable use of sound in this movie. Strongly subtle and very low key. Matter of fact I am sure many people have missed this fine trait of the movie due to the lack of proper equipment to hear the sound. It can be best described as an immersive sound field that barely hangs in the air and eventually falls to the ground. One that your not really aware as being there until you listen for it and then it disappears just as easily. Very similar to the tactile qualities of the ""Green Mile"" This movie should find its way into peoples movie collections not only as a masterpiece but also as a solid test disc. This can demonstrate your Projector's/TV's true potential or expose its fatal flaws. This movie will also show you how responsive your receiver may or may not be.",10
21 September 2007,"The commenter that wrote, ""A Great Movie, But Wholly Implausible,"" said it all!","The commenter who wrote, ""A Great Movie, But Wholly Implausible,"" said it all!

I am a real stickler for realism and plausibility, and even though I clearly recall saying to myself several times while watching it the first time, ""this couldn't possibly really happen,"" for some reason that I STILL fail to articulate, in this movie, IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER!!

And, that includes even the ending, for which, had something this ridiculous happen in any other movie I've ever seen, ...well, it would have delegated any other title in this genre that I've ever seen straight to the trash heap.

In this movie, for some reason, it was OK?!?

No matter how many times I see it (and there are only a dozen or so titles I can even watch more than once), watching this movie is just plain-and-simply a great time, no matter how many times I've seen it.

I give it a *strong* 8/10!",8
8 September 2019,Could've been at least an 8,"Unfortunately, the movie has a terrible ending that doesn't make sense. Without spoiling, I was loving the movie until very near the end (a scene in a rooftop at the end). Then the scene goes south and ruins the whole movie and trashes everything that made sense prior. Why this ending why!! Too bad.

20 April 2021,A monument to...,"Well done, excellent. However, this movie is a monument to consumerism. People with money bored to death, their solution being paying a company for alleviating their boredom. Without knowing it, the producers have made a movie that is a memorial to this done-to-death theme. The movie lets nobody down, the actors do what is expected of them and etc. But it leaves a dismal tone as its message is not something I symphatize with.

6 February 2000,Build up to nothing.,"The first half really drew me in. The intrigue was fantastic. I was riveted to the seat as Michael Douglas peeled back the layers of lies in an attempt to find the truth. And he kept peeling, and peeling, and peeling, AND PEELING. Okay we all get the picture already -- let's get on with it. And then, after all that build up, it ends. Everything is explained away. Just like that. Show's over. Nothing more to see. Go Home. A major let down.

24 December 1999,A challenging game played with our expectations,"There is not much to be said about this strange and exciting picture. Although not a very original picture, the acting, together with good characterization and directing, makes The Game one of the most exciting moments in Cinema these days. Good plot, good twists and turns, a false finale, followed by sweet finale. Douglas is great (his usual self), Unger is average, Sean Penn is good, and the rest of the cast helps the story move along. It´s a form of thriller that touches the fringes of fantastic tales (such as the ones by Stephen King and Dean Koontz). A good movie, full of surprises, you get hooked to the characters and wait impatiently for the finale.

28 March 2002,not up to david fincher's usual standards,"I can honestly say this is not a very good movie. I had just seen Seven and Fight Club and loved both of them and am excited to see Panic Room also so I decided to give The Game a try. I really wish I didn't. This is a movie that is not very interesting and runs at a slow pace. Michael Douglas DOES do a good job acting it's just the character wasn't very interesting. Another thing I am a big fan of in David Fincher films are the legendary plot twists. I mean the ones is Seven and Fight Club are genius. But this one is somewhat predictable and keeps changing as if it can't make up it's mind. Basically it's just not smart and edgy like Fincher's other films. But hey everybody has a bad film. All I know is that David Fincher is one of the best directors of today and I can't wait to see Panic Room.

22 February 1999,Beautiful box with a cheap content,"After ""Se7en"", which I repute a masterpiece, David Fincher returns with this noir that plays with secrets and deceptions. The content is cheap and the rhythm is slow. For more than an hour nothing really important happens. All the revelations are concentrated in the last few minutes without which the film would be a deadly bore also because Douglas is dull and unpleasant. Fincher, anyway, is still a good director: the grim atmosphere is flawless and the flashbacks are wonderful. If only he had had a good script!!!

19 April 2015,An original story? No!,"This film is very enjoyable, and may appear to be like no other story. However, viewers should be aware that there are striking similarities to a British TV mini-series from the late 1980's called The One Game. The makers of The Game do not appear to have acknowledged this in their credits. The plot of both is very similar, as is the relationship between the main character and his tormentor. Even the main character's name is similar! Both the film and the TV series are well worth seeing, though both have flaws in the plot, and rather stretch credulity! Compared with The One Game, The Game is less dark and takes itself a little less seriously.

13 June 2023,A decent idea that is stretched to the point of absurdity,"I have watched this movie a long time ago, and what I remember is that it is somewhat interesting, but requires too much suspension of disbelief, especially the ending.

So, in the lack of knowing what else to watch on one particular evening, I have decided to rewatch it again many years later, to see if maybe the movie is not that far fetched at all, maybe I had missed some clues, some logic behind it.

But nope. It seems my memory serves me well. The basic idea for the plot is ok, especially for the time when the movie came out.

The problem is, the logic behind the story is stretched to the point where no suspension of disbelief can help you. So many things don't add up, so many things could have gone wrong for the protagonist, the ''Game'' is so extreme and absurd that it just doesn't work.

If only they weren't so pretentious and decided to keep the plot a bit less absurd, this could have been a classic. 5 stars for the solid acting, production value, directing, etc. No more than that.",5
26 September 2021,Don't waste your time,"An hour into this film, I turned it off as I was fed up with waiting for it to get interesting. I was expecting this to be a fast paced, thriller/edge of your seat kind of film. Instead I found it 'lie back and have a couple of hours rest' kind of film. I'm not the biggest fan of Michael Douglas anyway, controversial i know, but i think he's a terrible actor. This film just proves it. Apart from waiting for it to get tense/interesting, it just has so many 'wtf' moments that I just couldn't keep up. The hotel room with the porn and the coke was the deal breaker where I thought 'Where's the 'off' button'??

I guess people have to watch it to make up their own mind but....don't say we didn't warn you ... :(

11 August 2018,This movie will f*** with your mind!,"There are surprises at every turn. It keeps you guessing to the very end. The end is satisfying, which is a welcome change from many movies like this that build you up only to let you down. Wonderful acting. I'd definitely recommended as a date night movie.

29 October 1998,"Douglas at his neurotic best, yet again","Chock-full of twists and turns till the very end, it's worth watching for its pure thriller value alone. One of the most potent mind-play movies in the recent past. I even developed a somewhat sickening sympathy for Scrooge Van Orton. Not that the plot leaves you with many others to root for anyway. Though I'm biased against suspension-of-disbelief stories in general, this one certainly has the makings of a first-rate thriller.

20 January 1999,A deadly game that you would not even give to your worst enemy,"this was a thrilling action packed movie that even found me biting my nails. The Characters were excellent as were the performances of Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.

To describe the plot in a few words I could say twisted, demented and mind-Boggling.

This movie received my thumbs up and I thoroughly enjoyed it an 8.5\10

11 January 2014,An intelligent film you don't want to miss,"This movie starts by being simple, taking some notes from Kafka's Process while maintaining it interesting and new. Micheal Douglas and Sean Penn make a hell of a duet!

It gets bigger and better as it goes on, making you keep guessing -almost always wrong- what's happening and what's going to happen. You start feeling nervous for the main character and you want the film to end so you get the ending. At the same time you don't want it to end because it's so damn good!

This is a movie I recommend highly and that I should have seen a long time ago.

I won't give you spoilers but suffice to say I always laugh at any story which has the hero expecting to be shot and wears a bulletproof vest saving the day.

Dumb and Dumber captured it beautifully, ""But what if he shot you in the face?"" You've been warned.

Such a let down after a very classy and intelligent start.

28 June 1999,"Thrilling, touching movie","The game has Micheal Douglas in his finest roles yet. Except for Falling Down, he hasn't really had any good movies lately. So, The Game really made him shine I'd say. The Game couldn't have a better actor. When you see the movie, you'll understand why. I never go into detail about plot, since thats what is great about a movie: Seeing it for yourself. But the movie is on the sad side. I simply love movies that manage to hold a dark side, without going to overdramatics or being just plain pathetic.

Scores are also important, and the sad tunes found in the movie are very fitting, and if you like the movie, you'll have the sounds of Howard Shore (the mind of the original music in the movie) in your head for days, maybe weeks. Brilliant work by Sean Penn and Micheal Douglas. Watch for some touching moments as well. Enjoy:)

23 April 2003,Astounded...,"I watched this with 3-5 friends a few months back, and I was absolutely amazed when, at the end of the film, each one of them thought it was one of the most intelligent films they had ever seen. I was like: ""What the f***?!"" Nothing wrong with Fincher here. He held up his end of the bargain, directing in his usual cool-stylistic fashion that I've come to appreciate. However, the movie has WAY too many holes in the plot that are downright inexcusable. I can't even name them all it's insane...first it's reality, than it's a game, than it's reality again with with a ""supernatural"" twist? Nevermind you cannot believe these switches because of all the inconsistencies... Movies like this are meant to look and feel smart, but they're just ""twisty"" and weird for the sake of being such, and desperately try to make that pass for an intelligent movie.

But hey, most of you love the film, so who am I to argue with a big crowd of ""intelligent"" and ""reflective"" individuals.

13 January 1999,Very Interesting,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Beautifully acted and directed by my favorite director. The story is very smart and entertaining. The movie started out very slowly and started to pick up its speed little by little. You spend the whole movie wondering -- what will happen next -- and hopefully you won't be bored. There is a great surprise at the end and it will make this movie a perfect one. I don't wanna give anything away. I saw this in the big screen and now I have the DVD of this movie. Go watch this one.

21 October 1999,This ain't Tiddleywinks...,"""The Game"" is one of those movies that I rave about after the initial viewing and then loses credibility every viewing thereafter. This dark and unrelenting journey through loss and manipulation had me on the edge of my seat in the theater. All the performances are first-rate, and the movie goes everywhere you could possibly want to go in an action/suspense film. Then I saw it again on video, and I started seeing the plausibility factor and the suspension of belief dwindling away. It's the same thing that 1999's ""ARLINGTON ROAD"" was criticized for: NOBODY CAN FORTELL THE FUTURE THAT ACCURATELY WITHOUT A LITTLE TIME TRAVEL GOING ON!!! However, it's still a romping good time the first time through. (***1/2 for the initial viewing...minus 1/2 every viewing after that).

I have seen this film a number of times & the small touches are where the whole thing pays off. Another film which needs to be seen from start to finish, you need to know - is this really a game?

13 April 2015,"The Game Is up There, but Not #1","David Fincher's movies Fight Club and Se7en were two of the most badass, plot-twisty movies I've ever seen. This gave me high expectations for The Game. I wasn't disappointed, but took a few issues with the movie.

This movie has the same great camera work seen in Fincher's other movies. I noticed a few small issues with sound mixing/editing. Let the fact that I don't know the difference between mixing and editing say that it's not much of a problem. Still, if I see a guy jump over a wall, I want to hear a thudding noise when he lands. It's a blockbuster, come on.

Nicholas, the main character, is a selfish bastard at the beginning. We could have seen anyone in the world sign up for the game, but it's a banker. A rich guy. One of the proverbial one-percent-pigs. Understanding his back-story and father's suicide already makes Nicholas more of a real person, but he does actually change over the course of the film. It's not exactly bad-guy-to-nice-guy, but it's a believable change, considering what happens to him and a good choice of a character to put in ""the game.""

Having seen Fincher's other work, I expected a huge plot twist kind of ending. There are plot twists and reveals. A plot twist is when the whole film changes course (in a way that fits) at/close to the end. A reveal, which is expected from the start, is when the big mystery is solved. I expected a plot twist when a reveal is what I should have been waiting for. You can't predict a plot twist. Other than the fact that it was a reveal, I didn't personally care for the ending. It was not a bad ending. It was a solid ending. Everything concluded in the way it needed to, but I couldn't help thinking, ""that's not how I would have done it.""

The Game isn't Fincher's best movie, but it's not bad. That being said, I liked it much more than an ""eh, wasn't bad."" The Game follows Michael Douglas as a selfish banker who signs up for an ambiguous entertainment service. The movie does a great job making the audience question the reality of each event. Is it the game or not? Though I didn't really like the direction the ending took, I can't say it was a bad ending. The Game gets a 7.5 from me.",7
31 December 2006,People who slate this film.....,"I think you are forgetting something here people - the psycho analysis tests and physical tests Van Orton went through - they were extensive, more than extensive, the data captured allowed 'the game' makers to predict what he would do under pressure, remember the embarrassing questions he was asked? the way he reacted? they would almost certainly have been watching his every move as well.... we also never got to see all of the tests... and he was soooo annoyed when they rang him to tell him he had 'failed' entry to his game! hahaha! I have made over 20 people watch this film and admittedly it is never the same after the first time due to the ending, they all say the same thing... ""That was one of the best films I have ever seen..."" and this is a fair cross-section of people here, not movie critics, we're talking clubbers, sportsmen, my parents, my boss, my little sister, and also 3 actors! When u have been left for dead in Mexico, and have thrown yourself off a building BECAUSE YOUR BROTHER HAS BEEN SHOT - BY YOU, and everything is a game you would truly appreciate what money can't buy you by the end...",10
28 December 1998,Perversely ingenious,"THE GAME is pure pleasure. Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orton, an upscale Scrooge placed into the Game, an elaborate series of sudden life experiences of escalating danger and intensity. The director, David Fincher, has made a movie about a man stripped of the security affluence and power provide. Yet he's done it by tweaking the protocol of film noir to serve his own cynical ideas about contemporary cultural-claustrophobia; the horror is how completely a ""recreational"" service can usurp a man's life and make it the corporation's plaything.

Fincher knows how silly this premise is, because he's also made a deftly existential, hall-of-mirrors stump-puzzle in which style and conviction count more than credibility. Are the Game's anonymous strategists trying to con Van Orton? Harm him? Which life events are games, and which are just life?

The mad-kick answers are far more satisfying than expected, with Fincher crafting the illusory suspense into a leisure-class nightmare of panic and confusion. Twisting a wealth-fixated Yuppie into a neo-noir hero is a shrewd move-exactly how much space is there between an icy investment banker and a laconic, Mitchumesque loner? This injection of modernity lends the film a surprising comedic thrust. We keep laughing that the control-freak is being controlled in ways never dreamed up by himself; the Game is so perversely ingenious and ruthless, even he's impressed.

5 September 2004,Absurd ending destroys worthwhile development,"Speaking as already a huge admirer of a large number of Michael Douglas' works, he came through in all regards. And I ""get"" the gushing high regards and user ratings: for most viewers this movie truly can keep you guessing - a tough feat, that only very fine movies can achieve without ""cheating.""

Uh oh. There's the hitch. I feel screwed by the utterly implausible, over the edge conclusion of the film. Why, they would have been better off toning DOWN the ending so it was believable at all!

One out of every ten movies I see is a bummer because I was pre-sold (or sold out) by the gushing accolades. This is one of them. 5/10.

22 July 1999,David Fincher and polarity,"The Game is unusual. Very few movies succeeds in encapsulating such a compelling plot that consciously subverts the intellect. After watching the entire movie and thinking back on the various situations, it would at first seem rather unlikely given the ending. I like to offer this: there is more than meets the eye. Perhaps a little ""movie magic"", if you will. I leave it at that.

It's hard to believe that David Fincher also directed Alien 3. I pull my hair out in frustration over that folly (read my review for ""Alien^3"" to understand). But i applaud The Game. it is a movie that so effectively conveys the mood, fear, and every twist.

This is a really good movie with an very surprising ending. Through out the movie you will see Douglas putting all the pises together. I was really annoyed by some of the comments on this movie, the hole point of the movie is that he first care about the money but then when he understand that he can´t get his money back he want to ""meet the wizard"" he wanted to see who had done this to him. But in the end he understand that money is´nt everything, that´s what the movie is all about to realise that money is´nt everything. There are many things you can´t buy wit money, that´s all it is... A really must see for everyone who has not seen it...

3 October 1998,Tedious and unconvincing,"The story drags, judicious editing would have made it more interesting. It actually bored me so much I was simultaneously reading a magazine until about the last 15 minutes.

The things that happen to the main character become more and more preposterous. Too much suspension of disbelief is required to imagine that the Company could pull off the set-up in a convincing way.

Mike Douglas gives his usual performance as 'himself'. There is little chemistry between him and the lead female character.

Basically, I should have spent my $3.50 at the video store on something else.

8 October 1999,What A Rush,"`Deadly Entertainment' The Game: rated R, 1 hour and 28 minutes

The incredible Douglas and Penn combo, along with the thrillingly unpredictable action sequences, are what make The Game such a great, edge of your seat' experience. Nicholas Van Ortan (Michael Douglas) is a millionaire tycoon who resides in San Francisco. Soon it becomes obvious that Nick is not the perpetually contented man that the ideal millionaire is thought to be. He is in fact very dissatisfied and bored by life. On his birthday, he meets with one of his only remaining relatives, Conrad Van Ortan (Sean Penn), at a fancy restaurant. Conrad, Nick's brother, convinces him to spice up his life by calling the latest new corporation, known as Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Nick makes an appointment, in which an odd series of tests are conducted on him, taking up a total of 24 hours. CRS takes Douglas on a wild thrill ride of implausible, yet fantastic events, as the movie will for you. The Game's lack of realism does not lower its status in any way, as Nick finds himself in deserted hospitals, talking to inanimate objects, driving off piers, jumping off buildings, and much more, with the frequent, brief, and mysterious appearances of Conrad. The Game is sheer fun and excitement as well as a must-see movie for all action/adventure lovers.

The Game, directed by David Fincher, also starring Deborah Unger, is rightfully accepted with a solid A.",
30 March 1999,"finally, the story","Maybe it's because I haven't heard anything about it before seeing it, or is it due to poor writing for cinema in general that has diminished my expectations, but here I've finally found a story with the beginning and the end, a little bit magical and also realistic: what to do when one has too much money and too much power and no sparks left in his life? Play the game and experience a rebirth. However, my sister says she was too clever for this one. Knew everything in advance, that is. I wonder how much the bill was, though.

22 June 1999,Intense psychological thriller...,"This movie should have been called Paranoia Incorporated... THE GAME was an incredibly intense psychological thriller, one that keeps you guessing at what's real and what's not. Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy investment banker but a miserable human being, receives a gift from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) on his birthday (""for the man who has everything""). The ""game"" that Van Orton becomes involved in consumes every aspect of his life and quickly starts to become nightmarish.

Sparingly advertised or critiqued, this movie was very underrated, and was absolutely the best mystery/thriller I have ever seen. At once you think you know everything that is happening and that is going to happen... but you're in for quite a surprise. The reality of THE GAME changes over and over and you are put in Van Orton's place as you try to figure out what's really going on. I give this movie 9 out of 10. I bought this movie as well, and even though I know what the story is, I still like to imagine what I would do in each situation (plus, if I've invited someone over to watch it for the first time, I love to see their reaction as their predictions are repeatedly dashed to pieces). The ending is nervewracking and insane (in a good way, of course), you will be shocked by it. This is also my favorite movie starring Michael Douglas, he is wonderful in it, and all the other characters are believable and well acted. David Fincher has done well with this movie as a successor to Alien 3 and Se7en, he is the paranoia king!",10

16 December 1999,A Twisted Masterpiece,"Well what can I say about The Game? Watching it is just bizarre - Fincher takes us on an insane journey, twisting our perceptions of what is going on every few minutes. The amount of conclusions I jumped to and then abandoned, only to later return to is astounding.The ending, which in retrospect should have made me feel cheated (but somehow doesn't), is awesome. An almost flawless film, and I defy anyone to figure out what is *really* happening before the last 5 minutes. This film is twisted on a level I never even thought possible! A brilliant, brilliant job by Fincher. Even Douglas (who I dislike as an actor) performed well, and aside from the odd plot hole (which is to be expected wit ha plot as interlaced as this) I cannot fault it. Wow.

16 August 2019,Excellent movie for 1997,"For all you trolls and haters that gave this movie 1 and 2 stars you are watching this movie from a 2019 perspective. In 1997 when this movie came out it was groundbreaking. This movie should have won way more awards in its time.

13 August 1998,From start to end you did not know what direction...,"From start to end you did not know what direction the movie was going to take you. It is quite a rare thing to have a film imitate a roller-coaster, this is the best film I have seen this year. Douglas & Penn were perfect and the ending was breathtaking. This is a must see movie.

24 May 2000,Thrilling?,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",
11 April 2000,I'd be willing to bet vital parts of my anatomy on the fact that you won't guess the end of this movie until the end.,"If you look at some of the other films I like, you'll see I like convoluted ones. This is a terrific example. Thrilling, smart, classy, and chalked full with detail, this movie has got it all and more. The music in itself is great, and the flashbacks are incredibly creepy. Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Deborah Unger, James Rebhorn, and Peter Donat all give great performances.

5 January 1999,THE GAME takes you for a suspenseful thrill ride !,"Michael Douglas brings the style, Sean Penn brings the edge to this gripping tale. Story moves along at a good pace drawing the viewer in deeper and deeper with each turn. Shocking end almost leaves you breathless.

THE GAME is suspenseful fun for all. For its true roller-coaster ride effect it reminded me of a movie called 'Fallen'

20 February 1999,Mystery-Action Thriller with a soul,"The Game is an excellent piece of film on many levels, not least of which is the strong philosophical perspective I believe it supports. Man's attempts at self-aggrandizement are ultimately doomed to failure, and it is sad indeed to watch someone careening heedlessly down the path of personal success with little regard for its effect on who they are. Conrad's gift to Nicholas is not just some life-enriching experience; he is giving Nicholas back his soul. There are many other excellent aspects of this film as well.

The cinematography alone is worth a second viewing, especially the grainy Super-8 style bits at the beginning set against the silent backdrop of those giant trees on Nicholas Van Orten's elegant estate, and the action scenes are crisp.

I used to dislike the way Michael Douglas was always playing this type of character, but I truly believe he was born to play this part. This movie, along with A Perfect Murder, has renewed my appreciation of him as an actor.

The editing and storyline were very tight, with a good pace and rich detail that constantly keep the viewer alert for fear of missing a crucial clue to what is going on. And the ending! I mustn't spoil the movie, but it is stunning.

This movie is the whole reason I subscribed to the IMDB. I wanted to get on and vote, and tell other people to go see it.",9

17 April 2000,I feel cheated,"Yes, I feel cheated after having been manipulated with so much suspense and tension, and then all resolving in such ""dull"" way. The mix of believable and unbelievable scenes keeps you wandering if you are looking at an action movie, or a fantasy one. For some that might be a good thing, but to me it looks like the ending was a last minute patch.

16 May 2000,excellent all-around,"""The Game"" is one of the better thrillers I've seen in a long time. It really hits on all cylinders: very original idea, well-written script, excellent effects, strong acting. Douglas gives one of his best ever performances as the icy Nicholas Van Horton, a rich investment banker who is given a birthday present that changes his life.

Overall, a very solid movie with a superb ending that is sure to shock most viewers.

21 February 2004,garbage,"this movie tries hard to play upon the senses of the viewer using the medium of the film itself; but it completely fails this due to implausiblity of how perfectly this ""game"" is planned out. the movie is flawed from the start- Micheal Douglas is a 2 dimensional cut-out ""jaded"" and ""mega rich""; but there is no sense that he is a real person; there are no books, magazines, papers and other various paraphernalia visible in his office or his home. given this type of hollow scripting, the ending while trying to provide a twist, ends up being the predictible outcome from the start.this whole movie is a waste- a waste of time to watch it and a waste of time, talent and money for those that did make it but could at least have done a much better job if only someone really tried.

And it has to be mentioned that the movie was a complete package of thrill and mystery... You won't regret spending two hours watching this masterpiece. There is no ambiguous storyline, but you may feel confused a bit for the first fifteen minutes.

27 July 2022,Terrible Ending,"This movie was fantastic for about the first 80%, then we get slapped in the face with one of the most disappointing movie endings I've ever seen. Its like the writers were told to go home early and the intern finished off the script.

I'm honestly confused by all the positive feedback in the user reviews - it seems almost as if some people turned off the movie a couple of minutes early...

A massive let-down that TOTALLY RUINED an otherwise interesting and well-made movie!

21 October 1998,"Maybe worth a watch, but probably not","Though an interesting movie with an interesting plot, The Game proved to be a disappointment. The acting was alright, and the plot was interesting. However, if they had only cut several minutes off the end, they could have had an ending that does'nt leave such a bitter taste in your mouth after the movie is over. But instead, they were determined to use a little God from the Machine to augment everything drastically. An alright movie, but the whole thing went down so dramatically toward the end that I didn't like it much. As an addition to its rap sheet, it was also terribly unrealistic. Maybe worth a watch, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is a game you'll end up wanting to lose.

28 April 2001,"Reasons why this disturbing, dark, roller-coaster of a movie kicked so much ass.","Wow.

Divid Fincher delivers, yet again. Those of you familiar to his work,(ex. SE7EN, Fight Club) will undeniably love this crazy piece of celluliod. Fincher's ""in your face"" guerilla style of filmmaking leaps out at you, grabs you by the cajones, and shoves a big gun in your face. What I'm trying to say, is that, this is the kind of film that takes you for a very dangerous ride right up until the end. It has various twists and turns and it keep you thinking. No rest. I'm not gonna give you a synopsis. I'd just be regurgitating something that's been explained over and over again. What I mean by, ""this movie keeps you thinking"", is that you can't ever be sure if the guy is still involved in the game or not. Is all this real or is it just part of a major conspiracy focused solely on YOU. Is all this part of the biggest mind-f*** ever carried out? You have to watch this movie to the very end. Trust me, you won't have a choice.",10

13 August 2000,"A game, and that it was","Which really kept me on my chair, was the wonderful pianomusic during the film. It gave an extra atmosphere to it, which I think it needed, because it remained a game, to me. I wasn't able to believe that what happened to Van Orton was serious. So I laughed a lot but wasn't really touched by the story. It was all to much: the big house with the man all by himself. The videofilms of his youth which I didn't found logical. No, even the game I didn't believe. Maybe that's the reason why I laughed so much. I don't think that other people can always know how a person will react in a certain situation, even after 2-day-psychological tests. I have to much faith in the fickleness of us people for that, even for a person like Van Orton (why always these strange old-Dutch surnames in films?) Sorry for my English. Greetings, Renske Verheul

26 March 1999,TRansplendent,"This is a great movie of the genre. It captures the moodiness and noir qualities one needs for an experiment in paranoic fantasy role playing. It had a much more surprising ending than Seven, which was also directed by Fincher. One note, I either read this somewhere, or I am just that smart, but the ending where he falls through the I believe is a total last minute add on. If anyone watches the last sequence I think they would agree that the 'new' ending was probably in place because it would have been too dark. Nontheless an entirely satisfying movie, with an excellent performance from Michael Douglas.

5 June 2001,An excellent mystery-psycho-thriller,"The Game is a must-see for everyone who enjoys intelligent plots, twisted turns and surprise-endings. Michael Douglas is Nicholas van Orton, a cold blooded investment banker, rich but not happy. The opening credits hint at a traumatic childhood experience. He witnesses a suicide on his birthday party. A possible explanation for his distaste of birthday celebrations, including his own. A mysterious birthday present from his younger brother changes everything. CRS (Customer Recreation Services) offers him a very special kind of holiday for which he doesn't even have to travel. After having filled a psychological questionary, his live begins to change dramatically. You must absolutely see this movie if you like the genre.

10 May 2001,Superb,"If you haven't seen this movie see it now.

This movie is without a doubt one of the best I've seen. It's full of twists, action and some damn fine acting.

Michael Douglas gives a brilliant performance, maybe even deserving of an Oscar. He plays the part of Nicolas Van Orten to perfection, After seeing this I couldn't imagine another actor playing this part other than Douglas. This movie is another example of how underrated and under appreciated Douglas is. Sean Penn gives a great performance as well but this film is definitely Douglas's.

But this isn't just a film full of good acting; the plot is full of twists and is guaranteed to keep you entertained. Keep your eyes open for the ending you'll never guess.

Incase you can't guess I loved this film and I think you will as well.

19 September 2001,A Multitude of Mind Trips and Surprises!,"I'm not going to tell you much about this movie except that you MUST watch it, and you SHOULD watch it at night without anything that could interrupt your experience. Turn of the ringer on your phone, disable your pager, put the kids to sleep. You will be pleasantly drawn into questioning reality. Watch it alone or with someone that is not going to talk at all or ask questions during the movie. It starts off slow, but hold on tight once it gets going.

18 August 2001,Would have been a good movie had the ending revealed something plausible.,"This movie will keep you not wanting to get up from your couch as this is one of those movies where you are hanging on just waiting to the explanation of why things are happening as they are. HOWEVER, The problem is when you finally get that explanation and you actually think about it you'll be upset. The ending reveals an answer that is so incredibly unplausible that it's an insult to the viewers intelligence. The movie ""Speed"" was more believable than this movie.

9 August 2002,It had me all the way ..... until the end!,"This is one of the better developed films in terms of suspense, mystery and drama that you will see in recent years. It captivates you with twists and turns; and overall offers the kind of mind-bending complexity that most movie-buffs strive for in a good film. But, It had me all the way until the end. I can't disclose the ending to those who haven't seen it, but let's face it; those that have, have to admit it is far-fetched and unrealistic. For the turn of events to occur as they did, at the end of this film, on top of the building seem to stretch reality a bit too much. If you get by this (which I couldn't) it's a terrific film.

13 July 2003,Very pleasantly surprised,"Another student brought this into my film studies class because he was studying David Fincher as an auteur, and without thinking about who the director was I looked at the box art (a picture of Michael Douglas) and made a very premature assumption of the quality of the film. We had the choice of either watching this or ""Seven"", and I was quietly wishing he had chosen Seven.

Fortunately, very early into the film I became hooked. From the start, the plot was fantastic and every time a new twist in the plot unfolded I became hooked even more. Then, disaster struck. The lesson was only and hour long and I had to stop watching. I'm a student with no money - how was I supposed to get this film so I could see the second half!? The part of this film I'd watched amazed and intrigued me so much that I had to find a copy of this film any way I could.

That night, I was going to rent the DVD at Blockbuster - something which I rarely do because it's so costly. When I was on my way there, my friend invited me to stay at his house and watch some Ruggero Deodato films (his subject for the auteur project). How could I refuse? The next morning we went to a bootfair, and armed with a little bit of cash I went around looking for videos to add to my collection. By this time I'd completely forgotten about renting ""The Game"" and I didn't expect to see it being sold at a bootfair. You'd have to be insane to get rid of a film like what I'd seen half of! Thing is, I did! It was a timecode version from a rental store I assume. The BBFC certificate logo had TBC stamped all over it and the sleeve was double sided with two versions of the cover art on.

It was easily worth the two pounds I spent on it! The rest of the film was even better than the half I had already seen. As the film progresses, there are so many twists and turns in the plot you almost forget what film you're watching! Michael Douglas is very convincing, and seems as confused as the viewer, as does Sean Penn. I was extremely surprised with Deborah Unger's performance too, having only seen her in David Cronenberg (the auteur I'm studying)'s ""Crash"". Her roles in the two films are so incredibly different I didn't realize it was her at first!

If you want a gripping thriller, go for this one. You won't want to be in the same situation I was and have to stop watching half way through, it's so gripping you'll be on the edge of your seat until the closing credits. Watch it if you're looking for something slightly different to the norm too, as with all Fincher's films. Whatever you're looking for, you won't be disappointed with ""The Game"" unless you're so much of a pedant you have to point out every flaw in the plot (all of which can be justified).

This film will have you paranoid and slightly doubtful about everything you do for quite a while after watching it.",7
19 November 2021,Not Finchers best,"No matter how outlandish the story may seem, there has to be at least a bit of your brain that's saying as you watch ""I could see that happening."" That's when you get drawn into the story. That's when suspense takes hold. That's when you begin to be able to feel the fear of the main characters. That's when a psychological suspense-thriller works really well. Unfortunately, ""The Game"" doesn't work really well. It doesn't do any of the above. It's simply not believable. Never once in the movie (or at least once we were introduced to the game that Nicholas Van Orten was playing) did I have the thought that ""I could see this happening."" Never. It was too outlandish. Think about it. In order for this game to work, pretty much the entire City of San Francisco would have had to have been onside. Van Orten could have done any number of things or (and here's the real problem) encountered any number of people who - not being in on the game - could have changed things completely. The game (to me at least) is unworkable; unplayable. Since that was my feeling right from the start, I didn't get pulled in by the story. I found it long and drawn out. The writers tried valiantly to keep me on my toes by throwing twists and turns and surprises - but I really didn't care, because I just didn't believe any of it. Too bad.

Too bad, because the cast was good and solid. Michael Douglas was in character, playing a fairly stereotypical character for him, as Nicholas Van Orten, and Sean Penn did well as his little brother Conrad, who presented Nicholas with the game as a birthday gift. I liked Deborah Unger as the ""waitress"" Christine. Honestly? She's attractive, but not the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, but she had a chemistry with Douglas, and she did present a real aura of sexiness, even though that wasn't particularly what the character was about (the ""I'm not wearing any underwear"" comment notwithstanding!)",7
11 August 2012,One of my favorite movies of all time,"A lot of people who watch movies tries to figure out how its going to end, especially movies like this one, that doesn't move in super duper quick shots. Instead it moves abit slower (absolutely not to slow) and the movie get that mystic feeling and also sometimes somewhat of a horror feeling to it. I've seen this one about 7 times and never have the people i've seen it with been able to guess the end, and that is what i call impressive, especially since this movie clearly states just by its title that the audience should try and figure out the ending.

Michare Douglas plays a character that i would go as far as to say that no one ever could do better. He's rich, powerful and very much alone, and how many actors can take such a big part of a movie and not make it boring? I'm not gonna write much about the movie, cause i don't want anyone reading this to get some hints ;).

This is a serious movie, not a comedy. So watch it in the right setting and get blown away.",10
31 May 2005,amazing from start to finish! Michael Douglass is king in this performance,"This film is gripping to the end, anyone who criticises it is not seeing it for what it is. 90 Min's of escapees. Now i love Michael Douglas anyway and this I feel is his best work- hes superb as Nicholas- a rich arrogant fat cat who has it all- then his world gets turned upside down almost overnight- I can watch this over and over again and for people that haven't seen it yet- it's a real treat. Personally its one of my favourites of all time- the story line and characters are just fun to watch= the chilling music score is perfect and the director captures the concept very well. Although Sean Penn doesn't have a large role- he is very affective as the ex-junkie younger brother.

2 July 2023,Too much potential left out,"I don't know if something is wrong with my taste, that I have found reviews of audience, newspapers and magazines of the time, and even now, calling it underrated...epic...one of the greatest...with even cults created for it.. Yet I must say that I didn't enjoy it, not even a bit.

The only thing that could be a bit intriguing for me is the movie idea, a game someone who cares for you puts you in to let you figure out what life is about. With love, enthusiasm and a problematic dilemma, this script could have been woven into something more glorious and memorable.

I bet no audience figured out what were they, the people of the Game, fixing, altering or even keeping in Nicholas, based on the tests. I still wonder if he really changed, but what in the first place needed to be changed? I don't see any difference between his version before the game and the one after it...is it noticeable in anyway?

It is like the writer found two or more interesting psychiatry facts, and decided to make a movie. At least make a movie.

It is unrealistic, the idea itself, yet if the script was written well, it could have been a real-life dream for many, that such an organization existed, that one would be examining themselves throughout watching the movie, ""What would have I done if I was in his place?"" That question was just a wish, I never really did ask it.

Of course the idea of figuring out what a human being is all about before installing him in a setup scenario to make him ""see after he was blind"", as the main character's friend told him at the beginning that this is the game's purpose, is an idea that holds much potential, which has not been manifested in this work.

Not much details about his earlier life was present, which is necessary, in my view, so links would be obvious to a thinker audience. Yet, there is nothing to think about. Why these incidents are being acted out specifically? That should have been his mind thoughts throughout the movie. Instead, he keeps acting unstable because in fact, there is nothing to figure out. What is the significance of giving him keys as a game tool, to save himself? Is he a narcissist who never accepts help, so they are humbling him? A narcissist would figure out 100 ways to save himself and not put himself into trouble or may not enter such a game at all. A multimillionaire, who is open to the world and speaks German, forgot the fact that passwords cannot be said in a phone call because he was stressed? Very wane.

I imagined I would see a plot where everything would be logically linked, ""Nicholas"" figuring out the meaning of every aspect and incident along the way, with constant search and a real-life situation, where he is under great pressure, and where he understands that he is fighting for his life, not just being paranoid.

This logical link that makes up plot twists which entertainingly satisfies a critical mind, sadly, isn't there.

The main character should have been much smarter, has suffered more throughout life, and with more of his character involved in the process, to give depth and volume to this script.

I could not even retell a ""story"", this plot needed a ""story"" and a very different build up towards the end.

The fallen action and the resolution were let to crash.

I would say that this 3 stars rating is only for cinematography, Finch did good, still not very memorable scene structures, despite him being the director of se7en, where scenes set up were engraved in the collective mind of the audience.",3
11 January 2000,"Why, why the end?","This is a good film, trust me you will probably enjoy it. For the first hour it is fantastic, things change and twist and skew...love it. Problem is that the end is so ridiculous. Hitchcock kept something up his sleeve, but it was always believable and improved the film. This the final hour does not do this. Don't get me wrong, this is an above average film, it just could have been so much better. David Fincher fans go and have a blast, but be warned, it isn't a patch on Fight Club or Se7en. But it is good fun; it just tries to be too smart in the one twist too far finale. It'll keep you guessing though.

I have 1 word for this movie. Awesome! No other words can explain how entertaining this movie is. Just like playing CRS for the first time, I wish I can go back and watch the movie for the 1st time.

Even though i've seen the movie a couple of times still and own it, I still enjoy watching it. Beautifully directed, plus acting is unbelievable.

Phew! Wow! That's it.

9 August 2022,A banker or a goofy,"The most implausible thing that made this film unwatchable since the middle:

This man is supposed to be a successful banker in one of the richest cities in the world but makes decisions and panics as if he is an inexperienced schoolboy with no connections in the real world.

If he was a middle class accountant or bored administrator it would make more sense.

A successful banker does not need to wave a shotgun around like desperate workingman to make people do as he please, he has a lot of other levers to pull. The movie tries to sell the idea that everyone even bankers can lose their ground but if fails miserably.

14 January 2000,Intense Movie that keeps your mind on its toes,"I watched this movie because it was recommended for people who liked Sixth Sense. Although it is not Sixth Sense in my mind, I still rated it a 10 because it was fabulous. It keeps you thinking the whole way through and has more twists that you can count... just how I like it. The acting could use a little improvement, but all around it is a great movie.

31 August 2000,One of my top ten!,"So many movies bore me with their predictable plots and over-used finales. I like The Game because of the opposite. After watching this movie, I made all my friends sit down and see it so I could watch the look on their faces everytime something unexpected happened. I was there, too, when they made their friends watch the film.

Yeah, the acting is great; Penn, allbeit a small part, was used perfectly. Douglas was some what typical Douglas-style but well suited for the role.

But it's not the acting that everyone remembers about this movie, as I mentioned bove, plot twists, like never before, are the jewel of this picture. After watching this movie, you'll probably start seeing ""CRS"" everywhere. If you don't get that, watch the movie!

8 March 2001,More twists and turns than a rollercoaster.,"The Game is not a movie that at first glance would appear to be anything special, yet after the first five minutes you are hooked.

David Fincher is fast becoming one of my favourite directors. His ability to execute fast paced thriller/ film noir is bordering on perfect. His style here clearly shows through and adds great depth to the dark and mysterious storyline. Along with an outstanding performance from Michael Douglas, 'The Game' takes you in more directions than a London cabbie.

Douglas (Nick Van Orton) is becoming increasingly depressed with his life, his rich lifestyle not making up for the loss of his father when he was at a young age. His younger brother Conrad tries to cheer him up by giving him a very mysterious birthday gift. He involves him in a mysterious game in which Douglas plays out in his ordinary life. Things become very mysterious and things aren't as they first seem.

The plot (if a little far-fetched at times) is gripping and what can only be described as 'pure film'. A good supporting cast add to the interest and suspense to this dark thriller.

If you enjoyed Se7en and Fight Club, then you are sure to like this.",7

17 January 2013,Sell all you have run and see The Game,"My younger brother, whose Stanford-Binet IQ score is 145, rarely shows enthusiasm about anything. That being said, when he does occasionally get excited about something it's for a good reason, and I've never known him to be wrong.

One quiet evening back in 1997 I received an email from him that said, ""Sell all you have run and see The Game."" There wasn't time for me to pull off a yard sale and make the 9:00pm show, so I kept my stuff, but I went straight to the movie theater.

129 minutes later I walked out of the theater with all of my mental and emotional faculties tied in a wonderful knot. I was bewildered, shocked, happy, and totally satiated by the single best cinematic ride I had ever been on.

Hollywood labels movies by genre, so you will find The Game listed under drama, mystery, thriller. Today, sixteen years later, we would probably say psychological-thriller, but combine all of these genres, and you still haven't rightly labeled this movie. Twice, in the years since The Game was released, I have met a person who hated it, but coincidentally both of these people had an IQ that hovered around 70, I'm just saying...",10
8 September 2001,Awesome,"this show is great. eventhough the beginning has alot of talking but once the game starts you'll never know who or what is the truth. it keeps you at the edge & when it finally ends...woah!!! P/S if u r gonna watch this...look for the clues!

9 December 2002,HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR. DOUGLAS,"Some of you know what it's like to be completely surprised by the ending of a movie. 'the game' is a good thriller, but what really surprised me was both the story and the ending. For me this is Douglas best performance since Wall Street. He plays a very un-nervous person, who seems to be well in touch with reality. Once he strands in Mexico, he seems to lose it and I thought at that point: 'Falling down' once again? It ends like a gigantic joke, and that's the only thing I can't understand. I mean, they take away everything and it doesn't seem to bother him at the end, after a jump of death!!! Come on!!!

But... I really must admit I liked it. Fincher (seven, fight club, panic room) surprises. three out of five.

7 March 2004,Overrated and utterly implausible,"I expected more from the director of Se7en. Frankly, Michael Douglas's character is a totally stereotypical ruthless rich man and the plot is just too utterly implausible. This is the main problem, the fact that this company's ""practical jokes"" are just so dangerous that they would have been closed down long ago. So many people could easily have died in this one that it is really just ridiculous.

Sean Penn is one of the finest actors currently working in the USA and he is sadly under-used here. As for the ending, if I was Michael I would be rather more upset. VERY upset. I don't think that I would see the funny side. Perhaps 4/10.

4 March 2005,A Great Psychological Thriller That Keeps You Guessing Throughout,"Anyone loving mysteries will love this movie, ""The Game"". It truly keeps you guessing until the rolling credits at the end. It is the much more serious version of the same story told in the Bill Murray comedy movie ""The Man Who Knew Too Little"", which was released at the same time, 1997. In both, a brother wants to give his brother an exciting birthday ""present"": the giving brother hires a theatrical group to secretly entertain his brother on his birthday. Along the way, however, things go horribly awry from the planned script. Through most of the movie, the brother being entertained doesn't know exactly what is happening to them, except in Bill Murray's case, he was told that he would be dealing with a theatrical group, but winds up in a ""real"" spy story, thinking all along he is still dealing with actors. While in Michael Douglas' case, he doesn't know what is going on for sure. I would watch both movies. They both are quite entertaining.

3 November 1998,"Great movie, awful ending","This movie engrossed me the entire time. The various plot twists and perceived realities were quite good (although it doesn't equal The Spanish Prisoner). Some things were predictable, but a good number of the viewer's predictions would often turn out to not be correct in the long run (or in less time).

This movie does have a flaw, however. And a pretty serious one too -- the ending is atrocious. Now, it starts out good, but it just descends into stupidity pretty fast. I guess that was the ultimate psych-out -- I kept waiting for the final twist when there wasn't one.

5 August 2017,My favourite film,"Personally I believe this film is a unique masterpiece. I love every single aspect of it and I think David Fincher here proved to be the number 1 director! The story is written and developed in an incredible way, building an entire ""tower of tension"" brick after brick from the first to the last scene in which you realise you've been watching something out of this world. Pure love for this film... it is my favourite film at all and it will probably always be.

22 December 1998,The game certainly started; no one knows how it would end.,"The game, I must say is one of the best movies I have seen that year. It' s another masterpiece by Micheal Douglas. The film has a very high cinematic language. The story is great and treated in the most perfect way by the director of the film. The film appears at first to be a normal action movie, in which the rich Van Orton, chases the bad guys, who by the most original way washed him off all his money. Even this way it could have been a good movie, but a traditional one. Yet the writer had more tricks in his pocket. I don't want to spoil the plot, so I won't mention further details. But I must say that the event sequence cleared up to be most unexpected and most beautiful. The film is different because it turned into having no bad guys at all as appears in the end, this in itself is pure beauty as your mind doesn't contaminate with real violence and blood that fill most (almost all) of the action movies. If you like Micheal Douglas then this is certainly your movie, for he almost plays solo here; all other characters are (not marginal) but complementary to his role; However, It's his life and his game. The director of the movie is the same director of ""Seven"", another of my favorites. The film has nothing common with ""seven"" except the great cinematic language, the quick paced actions, the unexpected events, especially the end. That end is the most suitable for the film, any other end would have changed the whole idea behind the story; It wouldn't have been ""a game"" any more. Take my advice, watch that film (If you haven't yet), and don't let any one tell you its story before you watch it! I give the film 8/10.",9
19 October 1999,A great suspense filled movie that keeps you puzzled and on edge,"The movie ""The Game"" really brings out Micheal Douglas's acting ability. ""The Game"" makes the viewer connect with the lead character. You become just as frustrated, confused and eager to find the truth as Douglas. Some say the movie is too unbelievable, but then you have to ask yourself: could it happen to you?

3 April 2007,Not very good to be quite honest,"I have had this film now for a while in the draw, but finally today decided to watch it, and to be quit honest i was disappointed to say the least, although well constructed, with its stylish cinematography the movie lacked key features, it was not stylish enough to be a artistic movie yet was thought about enough to make the movie one which needs constant attention. I feel that the whole movie had such a complex storyline for the sake of it due to the fact no satisfaction was aroused in my mind as the story progressed. Another negative is how slow the movie is to get going, in the sense that it really doesn't. All this considered the acting of the actors was to a high standard and some cool mise-en-scene throughout.

17 April 2012,Fincher Fans Only.,"Following ""Se7en"" was never going to be an easy task & in comparison to that masterwork ""The Game"" was always going to feel a little underwhelming, but by no means is it without merit: Visually, it is excellent (As with all Fincher movies) colour is drained from the screen giving it an almost sepia feel. As with the visuals, the score is minimal - and used to great effect - creating suspense & an unsettling quality a la ""Se7en"" & ""Zodiac"" but while there is much to savour and admire; ultimately - this film lacks any real substance.

Towards the end of the film, Michael Douglas' rather unlikable character states that he wants to ""look behind the curtain"" unfortunately, there isn't much there, the ""Is it a game, or is it real?"" scenario has been done much better in other movies & credulity is stretched to breaking point; on repeated viewings things just don't add up. The less said about the ridiculous ending, the better.

Nonetheless, I would recommend ""The Game"" one can file it under ""Interesting misfire"" as it lacks the depth & overall satisfying conclusion of a ""Se7en"" or ""Fight Club"" but for Fincher fans, there is much to enjoy here.",8

This movie is beautifully done. I recommend this highly. And when you do watch it, you had better watch from the beginning to end, to get the full effect of it.

6 December 1998,"Please, Mr Fincher!","The Game includes one of Michael Douglas's finest performances. It is one of the more atmospheric and stylish films I have seen. It would have even topped Se7en as one of my favourite films, except for one thing.

The ending! When Van Orton jumps off the edge of the building, we hear Christine scream his name and then see visions of his father. Right there! That's where should've been taken to another ending where Van Orton dies, just like his father.

I believe that was the original intention, it might have even been filmed. But the ending that is in the movie seems too much like a tacked-on Hollywood ending. They show the downbeat ending to a test audience, they don't like it because it's not Armaggedon or something. So the studio have to reshoot & rewrite the ending (That's where I think the ""Gonna shear some more sheep"" line comes from, it sounds like it was written in a hurry).

Why? Why? Why? You had a brilliant movie WITH the downbeat ending. That's why I ask David Fincher to please, please release a Director's Cut. I know the real ending is out there somewhere.",
5 April 1999,thoroughly captivated,"When I first saw this film, I truly believed I hated it until the final scene. How could I care about what happens to such an obnoxious person? But care I did, and I was held in my seat by the sheer puzzle of it all. Painstakingly put together with fantastic performances from the leads. The Game is one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.

9 April 2000,INCREDIBLE. SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.,"I finally got around to seeing this amazing film last night. The Game stars Michael Douglas as very uptight businessman who receives a unique birthday present from his brother, played by Sean Pean. The present is kind of an enrolment into a ""game,"" sponsored by a very large, mysterious company called Consumer Recreation Services. Douglas has no idea what he is getting himself into. The utter treachery of this ""game"" is completely unanticipated; Douglas' bank accounts are drained and his life is threatened, which are only two of the many things that go wrong in his life. Throughout the film, I asked myself one question: Is CRS completely responsible for Douglas' bad luck, or is he only paranoid? Douglas is perfect for playing the part of a man desperately clinging to sanity in a world turned upsidedown. The film is great as it is before the final development (which is very unexpected), after which it is amazing. The Game is now one of my favorite films. Watching The Game, I was reminded of The Truman Show. In both films, one man fights to preserve his humanity in a world that oppresses freedom and truth.

8 October 2004,Great idea doesn't make a great movie,"David Fincher has proved that given a taut script, he will turn it into a great movie. Seven proved this and, to a lesser extent, David Koepp's Panic Room. Two of his movies, Fight Club and, this, The Game, prove that he can't quite turn a great idea into a great movie.

The premise of The Game is fine: a mischievous brother of a bored businessman finds a company that offers the customer a roller-coaster ride of an experience...but in the real-world rather than in a theme park. The brother buys him the ""ride"" as a birthday present.

The movie does reach a natural conclusion, but it has too much implausibility to get there. It seems as if the script was tweaked at the last moment to either ratchet up the excitement or to simply get the audience to ask themselves, ""how will our hero get himself out of this now?"". In the end, the audience will probably feel cheated by the answer. Perhaps if it didn't quite take itself so seriously, then I might have let it get away with it a bit.

Michael Douglas is most certainly not extending his acting talent here. He plays the man-in-peril so well now and, as he gets to play it so seriously (and leave his pants on), you wonder if working with Fincher was the real reason he got involved with this. Still, you can't help think that Douglas was left scratching his head at the whole thing.

Sean Penn is criminally underused as Douglas' brother. Penn plays his part so less straight-faced than Douglas that you almost expect him to give you a knowing wink. Perhaps Penn hoped that the rest of the cast and crew would treat it the same way as he obviously did.

The Game, though, is an extremely well-made film. Fincher manages to incorporate some ingenuity (the clever car-into-the-water sequence) and craftsmanship to the proceedings. Undoubtedly, Fincher will make some great films in his career, but let's hope he picks his scripts carefully.

2 January 2006,Fincher is the star of this film,"David Fincher again makes a film that is psychologically challenging, subconsciously scary and a film with a winding and complicated plot. Like Seven, the atmosphere is cold and distant, which adds to the story of the film, by creating an eerie and seemingly unrealistic world in the film. Michael Douglas is great as usual, and Sean Penn is good, though he doesn't really match the party-boy character he plays. Like all Fincher films, he creates a sense of action that is not obvious, but is as exciting as a regular action movie. There is a real sense of tension in this film, that builds up gradually towards the end Good film -- What Happens when you play the game, and the game plays you

5 August 1998,"After viewing this film, I was virtually flabbergasted. Phenomenal.","One night, a friend and I rented this little known movie called ""The Game "". I was not very enthusiastic about it since I heard it did not rate well with audiences at the box office. I was in for the surprise of my life. The Game was unbelievable. I was in stupified. The atmosphere was dark and taut and left me in a state of shock and surprise. I think that the director ( David Fincher ) now rates as one of the hidden talents of film direction. When I returned the movie, I kept asking when was the movie going to be available for purchase. I had to have this movie. To drive this point home, I must say that this is the first video I have ever purchased from a video store.

10 November 1998,"A must see, something you wouldn't miss.","So, The Game is a masterpiece, any problem? Ok, I happened to like this kind of movie. I like them so much, that although I know how it ends, I see them twice, and if I like them a lot, three to six times. The Game is a movie that will surprise you with every scene, the only predictable thing about this film, is that it will make you think you know what is going to happen but it will surprise you over and over again. A must see.

23 May 1999,this one will not be soon forgotten,"This movie succeeds completely in creating another world that is convincingly paranoid within it's own logic. I became Michael Douglas and was as much confused and scared as he was, too bad that in the end much of that spell was broken and Michael Douglas became another person. Although there were some obvious compromises in the movie, it had that almost classical kind of quality in which it is not only fun to watch, but also to analyse and philosofize over again and again. A movie that will not be soon forgotten.

29 April 2000,A Christmas Story,"Van Orton was Scrooged in this great movie. The cinematography was excellent in the flashback footage of the protagonist. The audience is taken on a suspension ride of disbelief (like Magritte's pipe).

Van Orton was the dynamic character in this movie because he went through a sort of catharsis. The sequence of events were definetly contrived and could cast doubts on it's realism. However, the ending is a must. (One member commented that it was just some deux es machina.)

BUT--it isn't because just like The Fight Club, Sixth Sense, the usual suspect and other movies before/after it, the entire movie hinges on an unexpected ending. That's what makes this a classic in my book (in lue of the run of the mill Christmas Story or Miracle on Corny Street).

6 April 2001,It's only a Game!,"This is one of my favorite movies that i have seen in the last ten years. I saw it twice when it came out in september of 1997 and i own the DVD it is something that i watch at least two or three times a year.Michael Douglas gives one of his best perfomance's,this movie has a great cast and David Fincher the director knows how to get the best of his actors. I highly recommend this great movie. P.S( Sean Penn is great as the brother of Douglas a must see.

30 July 2000,Great but not the best...,"...film David Fincher have made. The film is good but the end was a bit of a anti-climax when it actually was a game. Michael Douglas is the same. It really doesn't matter which director he has. He walks, talks and acts the same in all movies. Sean Penn, even though his part is a small one, was great as usual. The game is not a common movie, it has a lot of surprises, even the end so I think it was a really good film. I just wish Michael Douglas wasn't in it.

If you like this film you have to see Fight Club, the best film David Fincher ever directed!

20 July 2006,This film made me lose The Game,"Rule 1: You are playing The Game.

Rule 2: Whenever you think about The Game, you lose.

Rule 3: Loss of The Game must be announced.

A very interesting and thought-provoking film, but with the unfortunate side-effect of making you lose The Game. Anyone that liked The Matrix or Truman Show should definitely watch this. The acting is good and the film generally very involving. You really feel the increasing anger and confusion that the main character (played by Michael Douglas) feels as the film progresses. The film is also very fun to watch again and again, especially if you keep score of how many time you and the other viewers lose The Game throughout.

4 June 2014,"Great idea, terrible execution.","The Game isn't terrible, it has top notch acting from both Douglas, Penn and Unger. However there's a reason this is deserving of a 5 and not an 8 or 9.

I can only suspend my disbelief so far and The Game is about a mile beyond that, the original idea of a man who is bored of life's activities intrigued enough to sign up for a ""game"" without any idea what it's about. However, the execution of said idea is about as ridiculous as Stalone and De Niro making a boxing movie in 2013.

Okay first off, 53 year old Michael Douglas would most likely die from the stunts his character performs in the movie. The first likely death or serious injury of Douglas would have occurred in the first adventure where they have to fall what looks like 25-30 feet into metal garbage bins, better have good aim considering they looked to be about 4x5 feet. Next,the taxi bail into the body of water according to Christine they had a safety net, except how long would it take to pull out a full cab of water, most likely long enough for him to drown. I'll skip the minor possibilities and go right to the most ridiculous part, the end, so Douglas shoots his brother with what i assume is a blank because they showed his chest, after shooting his brother he jumps off the building and happens to land perfectly on the target they had set up, lucky he walked off the perfect spot of the building, also lucky he didn't have a heart attack on the way down which is common for people jumping off skyscrapers, also also lucky he landed o the target zone on his back or chest and not his neck.

Anyways not a terrible movie but a little bit silly for me.",5
10 June 2011,Could have been so much more,"I just rented this movie through Redbox, didn't realize it was so old.

This movie could have had some fixes to make it more believable or at least for the viewer to have a little more buy-in on what happens to Nicholas Van Orton.

Spoiler - Nobody can possibly believe that other people can strategize each move that another would make so that they could stay ahead of them - unless it was a dream or a matrix like situation where none of it is real anyway and completely concocted from software. For instance, what if while he is taking his tests in the beginning, they pull him into a virtual reality, which we don't know about until the end, which is ""the game"" - rather than trying to convince the audience it was real.

Second, there wasn't enough character development in the beginning for anybody to care what happens to this guy or what issues he has beyond being a cold workaholic to understand why the game is laid out as it is. If we knew he was afraid of heights or of suicide, or of failing to be perfect, the things occurring to him might seem more intense. (such as jumping off the fire escape into the trash cans, being trapped in an elevator, having his briefcase not open up when needed, etc.)",5

2 August 2020,Worked well for entertaining a guest.. great suspense flick.,"Just saw this maybe my 4th or 5th time and it finally lost its luster for me. But the guest for whom we recommended it was stoked: ""Oh, this movie!"" by the third reel. What is it about this flick that makes it so entertaining the first time? Of course the reason is that it's a mystery. (see Library > Mystery Section)

Notorious loose cannon, boomer liberal Sean Penn (and the feeling that friend Louise Ciccone is in the wings) dominates his character, the smaller part of Conrad, who touches his virtually opposite brother Nicholas (Michael Douglass) suggesting he change his straight laced ways. Both apparently are filthy rich, but only Conrad has grown up, according to these outre, dramatist-based rules for emotional growth: maturity according to dramatists.

The film comes from this place, like a Madonna concert, like most dramatists. It wants us to out our sexuality, or whatever else might be holding us back from being a free, more gregarious and therefore more honest spirit--usually vanity, and that is true for Nicholas, as is briefly shown when he sees himself in the mirror. All dramatists hate vanity. As well, I guess, since it's so important to hide vanity in order to keep up appearances. Trust me, you wont be able to hide, once dramatists have their eyes on you. Funny.

Like a Madonna song, the message behind the movie is: Respect Yourself. According to dramatists and other folks who rely on gregarious behavior to succeed in life, all quiet and otherwise shy wallflowers need to be changed if they are ever to fully enjoy life. Granted, not all quiet people are vain power brokers. Nonetheless, the dramatist's (movie gen's) credo is clear, at least how it appears to be fueling the message within this film. Which is a movie gen icon, if nothing else.

Enter: 90s EFX: feature film special effects units, the state-of-the-art. If the EFX culture had a heart, and wanted to share a message with the world, this would be its story. It's dramatists again, after all. Like athletes, or Jack La Lane, they want you to out your stuff, too, to ""give it up"" and become a stronger, more sociable person. See, I knew there were adolescent girls behind this, and frankly I don't mind that. Don't mind being reminded that I need to get out more, be more sociable. Almost as good as having my own daughter, watching action flicks like this. Maybe this movie was a little bit smarter daughter, though. Def smarter than most action films.

Slightly but just enough, is a theme here. Like a well trained sharper, Oz never gives too much away, as that would ruin the potential dramatic impact of the show. Dramatists are hustlers, after all, and there is nobleness in lying, and keeping the audience/mark in confusion. Without such proper white lies, stories tend to get boring. So, like a richly ironic Mamet script, sometimes lying is the most fun a girl can have, as it were. If you've ever encountered a mysteriously demure woman who deliciously confuses you with serendipity, this will similarly take you to that Very Interesting, But Schtupid place so many men and women have found to be enjoyable foreplay. Right here in this PG movie: decades of outmaneuvering censors finally pays off.

This singular, vague romantic interest is what romantic premise, or suggestion of a premise, basically carries this action film from a later, less erudite era than the golden era noir films of which its mysterious blonde moll is reminding us. Kristine (Deborah Kara Unger) is predictably from a lower class place. So it's (remember, it's a game) rich guy with diamond-in-the-rough-actress. She being 80s fashionably plainer than golden era menacing blondes in similar situations.

But her less cosmetic face doesn't in the least hinder an excellently directed and edited (David Fincher and James Haygood, respectively) show of darkly comedic timing for this quietly manipulative moll. Well reminiscent of Hollywood golden era's cleverly intelligent, hard-boiled blondes, and therefore reminding us, for example, of Stanwyck in Double Indemnity (1944).

It's good film-making (directing, editing), but I think that's also called acting--another word for it might be ""modesty,"" particularly in how less story depth tips the scale away from dialogue (deeper subjects) typically found in such classic era psychological noir above, paving a smoother floor for molls to dance their thing. Ferris and Brancato's fast paced, plot twisting, suspense packed screenplay is a cinch, is this regard.

All put together, it's a win-win, fun movie entertainment. As long as you don't mind having your ego outed by 80s New Wave punk sensibility, which is always gonna be a de-intellectualizing, sexually outing process meant to insult shy folks, somehow for their own good, usually involving lots of dancing and drinking, maybe screaming, and probably attending a Madonna concert where we learn that it's not nearly so important how you think, as how you look.

Dramatists are like the Wizard of Oz. They're always outing everybody. But here, a word of warning, you may mistake Oz for the mops in the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Look out! Oz is out of control! Damn dramatists. Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em.",9
7 February 2022,Personally I found it really easy to foresee 90% of the actions...,"I often watch movies based on there IMDB reviews and I came across this movie. At the time I looked it up it had a rating of 7,7/10 which often means a really good watch... But to be honest I foresaw pretty much every act that wanted to ""surprise"" the viewer.

Even the end was so obvious to me, maybe because I watched so many movies and always try to outsmart the movie maker or think like them... I don´t know...

At the end, this movie couldn´t really surprise or entertain me for a movie being rated an 7,7/10.

I give it a 6.

14 October 1998,Was it worth the money?,"The movie has a tedious start, but, like a slowly cranked vice it mounts with increasing pressure until the shattering climax. This movie is well thought out, it takes a stretch of the imagination but once you have gotten the mind set for the movie it is a great storyline. Douglas plays the rich, morose, tightwad with perfection. When I left the movie theatre, I felt that my 8.75$ was well spent.

5 April 1999,The most unpredictable film ever.,"I loved this film because I never knew what was going to happen, or exactly what was going on. It kept me in suspense the whole time. The actors were convincing, and the plot was completely unique to anything I have ever watched before. The only drawback is that I don't think this is a film you could watch twice with the same effect.

14 July 1999,FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME...,"From start to finish, The Game is a tight, intelligent thriller loaded with suspense. Personally, I love movies with twists and turns, and this movie delivers that big time. Michael Douglas is perfect as Nicholas Van Orton, a millionaire who gets involved in a bizarre game. Throughout the film, you become so engrossed in Van Orton's plight, it's as if his trials and tribulations were happening to you! Without giving anything away, the ending has to be one of the greatest in cinematic history. You're virtually on the edge of your seat waiting to discover the truth...is it a game or is it real? I'll say this much. If you can see one movie in your lifetime, make it The Game. You'll be glad you did.

23 November 2002,A definite favorite,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was just dragging on so long--it's so confusing until the end--and then it's wonderful, full of closure. It goes beyond the corporate world, to psychological thrills, action, and mystery--and you are never sure why anything is happening.

When I show it to my friends, they keep asking, ""Why did that happen? Wait, what's going on now?"" But I don't tell them. Although they aren't sure they like it and keep shaking their heads, when the end comes they decide that it was definitely worth their time.

Just to be ironic, it is--hands down--my favorite item to give someone for their birthday.

19 November 1999,Mesmerizing,"""The Game"" is an engrossing, white knuckler of a movie--the best kind of intense suspense plots. There are shades of ""Three Days of the Condor"" (another favorite) in it. I changed my mind on what was actually going on about 3 times. It's rare that a movie can be that successful in hiding the true plot from the audience.

Michael Douglas and Deborah Unger were perfectly cast. They played parts in a real-life computer adventure game. Just like in an adventure game, the main character receives or picks up items along his journey--never knowing if, when or how he may need them. Michael Douglas had to use every bit of his imagination and wits to get himself out of potentially dangerous situations. He never knew what would come next. This is the ultimate clue hunt. What a clever script. Highest recommendation.

21 May 2000,A great mind-twisting ride,"This movie was the first I've seen in years that really held my interest. It was a complete mind game from beginning to end with fantastic performances by Douglas and Penn. When you watch it, make sure it's from beginning to end in a darkened room with NO interruptions. Concentrate and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

17 April 2000,"A great flick, except..","It's got to be one of the worst endings I've ever seen! Don't necessarily take my word for it because I'm in the minority amongst my friends on this. It's a very intense movie, with terrific action sequences. It makes for yet another great Michael Douglas movie that will likely play on basic cable for years like Fatal Attraction and Wall Street have. I just would have written a different ending. I can't believe so many people actually enjoy that part of it. To me, it's an awesome flick that is best if turned off just before the end ""surprise"" is revealed. It's a hell of a surprise but consider yourself warned. Up to the point where this ""surprise"" is revealed, I'm on the edge of my seat, rooting for our man Douglas to beat the enemy and prevail as the hero. At the end I'm left saying ""oh, okay.. well, thanks for nothing, consider me tricked, ya got me, what else is on tonight?"" Best to catch it for free on cable.

16 October 2000,Suspenseful and Thought-provoking.,"I saw David Fincher's The Game last night on TNT and have to say it was for the most part a pretty satisfying experience, although as others have noted, the ending, which I won't give away, does not exactly fit the preceding two hours or so, because it has a bit of a cop-out, wrong-note, life-affirming sort of feel to it. Michael Douglas, who has emerged as perhaps Hollywood's best lead actor in the middle-years range, gives one of his most impressive performances. He plays a wealthy San Francisco investment banker here, but while this guy may be as corporate-greedy as Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's socially concerned Wall Street (1987), Nick Van Orton is a character you can sympathize with as his wayward younger brother, played by Sean Penn, tempts him to re-awaken a side of himself that his life as a powerful capitalist has apparently deadened. The thing that is supposed to change his life is The Game, an experience custom-tailored to participants by a nebulous corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Van Orton's curiosity impels him to submit to CRS's psychological and physical testing without even knowing what the exact nature of The Game---its rules, its object---actually is. In a scene alluding to Kubrick's 1971 version of Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange, Van Orton is stuck in a dark projection room being fed an endless series of unrelated images interlaced on the screen with suggestive words. Before he knows it, Van Orton is plunged into a non-stop sequence of experiences, more life-threatening than life-enhancing as his brother had promised, precipitated by the pretty good Deborah Unger as Christine, a waitress at a swanky restaurant. As Van Orton is confronted by a series of weird events, such as finding a life-sized clown doll lying on its stomach on the drive outside his mansion, an image deliberately designed to evoke for him the childhood memory of seeing his father commit suicide by throwing himself off their roof, he begins to question whether CRS is really in the private entertainment industry or has he been set up. Is CRS some kind of scam designed to bilk him of his fortune? Can he trust Christine, who is thrown into the non-stop action along with him? Is his brother in on it, too? Fincher's breathless direction keeps you riveted to your seat waiting to find out how this will all be wrapped up. Proof that this picture is so engrossing for a wide array of tastes is that I saw it at my mom's and she ended up enjoying it as much as I did, even though I took her to see last year's Fight Club, also by Fincher, and she ended up walking out of the theater by the end of the first half hour of that picture, saying, ""I'll wait for you outside. This is disgusting."" Well, I loved 1999's Fight Club, which was much better than the ridiculously overrated American Beauty, and for me, after having seen The Game, I think Fincher is in the top handful of the best Hollywood directors to come out of the last decade. While The Game is not as darkly subversive as Fight Club, it explores some of the same themes and concerns, such as the emotional emptiness and social disconnectedness engendered by the single-minded pursuit of wealth and the need to find something drastically outside the ""mainstream"" in order to get back in touch with the primordial self, as well as the paranoia unleashed by the rapid pace of computer technological change. For people who say that the somewhat sappy wrap-up at the end makes them feel ""cheated,"" they ought to consider that this movie makes you think while at the same time taking you for a rip-rollicking, good suspenseful-thriller ride. Not too many movies come along all that often that can do that.",
4 October 2000,WOW!,"What more could you ask from a movie?. Exceptional plot, great acting. Must admit it kept me guessing from start to finish. Movies like this don't come around often so please go and watch it NOW!. My favorite scene was when Nicholas comes home to find his house (mansion!) burgled. The song that is played is among my favorites and took me countless hours of surfing to find.

3 April 2006,Backchannel info,"Someone recently told me told that the screenwriter for ""The Game"" had in mind that the ""actors"" in each Game were active or former CIA and FBI operatives and that the ""Game"" was constituted a kind of testing ground for various techniques and strategies to study deception the influence on people (allowing for near real life training and experimentation.) With such government sanction, it is why the Game actors would be able to do so much in public places and environments. This helps one make sense out of the seeming latitude unbelievability of the Game actors and what they pull off in public without real police getting involved. Only wish that had been made clear at the end of the movie.

Not sure if this is true but it makes sense

9 August 2003,"Slick, ominous, suspenseful and compelling","The first time I saw this movie I was disappointed in the ending. That wasn't because the ending was an anti-climax - far from it. On the contrary, maybe it was the fact that the first seven eighths of the movie was so impressive.

The movie exhibits all the cinematic style and flair of Director David Fincher's other efforts; viewers will notice the use of murky lighting and largely night-time scenes used in Fincher's successors, ""Seven"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Panic Room"" to create a unique brand of menace and suspense. While ""The Game"" contains the necessary plot twists and the application of Michael Douglas in this role is a case of casting perfection, the film does not quite carry off the synergy of plot and direction towards as powerful a conclusion as, say, that in Fight Club.

But I AM being picky here. The pace is far from inert; there is plenty of action and there is more than enough happening in the story to keep you in suspense without requiring much concentration from the viewer.

Despite the odd (minor) errors in continuity and the final scenes making a rather hurried attempt to tie some of the pieces together (and answer your questions) there is rather little to criticise. If this is your first time, chances are you won't pick the ending, but it almost seems as though you weren't meant to in the first place. Sean Penn turns in a commendable, dynamic role as Douglas' brother in the film, and there are no overt blemishes in the acting of the other characters.

If you're not desperately after the mind-warping in-your-face vivacity of Fight Club but you want a little more substance; a more satisfying and climactic ending than that of Panic Room, you can't go wrong here.",8
14 July 2002,Interesting...,"I just wanted to point out that the essence of the plot bears a striking resemblance to the novel The Magus by John Fowles. In both the movie and this book, it is most interesting to note the changes the protagonist goes through as a result of being deprived of control over his life.

A very forgettable film which I'm sure I'll forget right after this review. They should retitle, ""The Game"" and call it, ""The Lame"". If you watch this because you had nothing better to do, you'll realize you had a lot of better choices even after the first 35min. Try Shoots and Ladders, Sorry, or Solitaire instead of this White Rabbit stupidity.

4 February 2003,Brilliant --- apart from the ending,"I had no idea this film would be anywhere near as good as it is. I suspect that, had it been released after Fight Club, it would have received far more press attention and favourable reviews. Douglas is pretty good as the increasingly stressed-out businessman, Penn is good too and the whole thing is taut, gripping and excruciatingly enjoyable. The only thing that lets it down is the slightly weak ending, which rather lets down the rest of the plot but shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the film too much. Highly recommended!

26 March 2010,Twisted movie with a 'Twist',"In short, very few movies have made my heart sink to a low that makes me feel like there's been a heavy weight added to it, shout out going to Kelly in Ohio at this point. There are movies with a twist which usually brings the viewer back to reality or that reveal a secret meaning to what's gone before. Unfortunately for me, the twist in this one will be leading me to an early grave, not due to the quality of the acting which was as always 'adequate' Douglas, but simply due to the fact, how do you create a meaningful twist out of such a twisted movie? The answer is you can't!

This movie is not one to watch alone, not one to watch with the family, nor the Mrs's or dare i say it with friends, which leads me to the conclusion that this movie is one for the dogs.

6 June 2010,"""And all I got was this stupid T-shirt"" - The Game","Who is this for: psychologists; i-bankers; pranksters; fans of NY; people who like some mystery; students of life. Why I liked the movie: 1) The unique concept of the Game: ""A profound life experience"". 2) Cast: Douglas playing a wealthy investment banker (reminder of ""the Wall street"") and Sean Penn playing a psyched-out younger brother. 3) The rich lifestyle the BMW, the biggest house in the neighborhood; ""1000$ shoe""; Swiss bank accounts. 4) NY in all it's glory; beauty and ugly 5) the details: the clown; the keys 6) great visuals and sound the effects, which made the movie the suspense and mystique 7) the T-shirt saying: "" I was drugged and left for dead in Mexico - and all I got was this stupid t-shirt""

28 May 2003,This movie keeps you in the game from beginning to end.,"Absolutely one of the best thriller movies I've seen. The suspence is taut and sustained throughout the film. Great acting, as usual from Micheal. Sean Penn is also top notch even though I'm not a great fan of his. If your into suspence, especially those with Micheal Douglas this movie is a game worth playing.

2 February 2004,Is it good?,"I almost gave it 10 out of 10, but it got only 8. Why? The beginning vas good (very gripping), the main part - just perfect, but the ending... it was so typical! I really haven't expected yet another ""happy end"". Well, Douglas has performed one of his best actings, the story is really new, i bet you haven't anything similar to that. It's a pity that it hasn't strong finish...

14 April 2021,2021 Review - It still works,"So I've never seen Michael Doughlas this YOUNG. I've watched a lot of suspense, thriller/ mystery movies etc and for a 1997 film this still surprised me. Granted the dialogue is predictable and boring but the pacing and twist is still pretty good. You'd think multi billionaires have a better use for their time (see ending) but what do I know? It was enjoyable and kept my attention. It's a pretty good film, I wouldn't rewatch but if there was nothing else on the TV I wouldn't mind.

14 September 2011,The Game,"All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",

23 April 2004,The only bad thing about this movie...,"Wow. This movie had me stunned. It's a see-once-movie, or at least a see-once-every-couple-of-years-movie... Very unexpected allthrough. Excellent story telling, acting, manus... As I'm writing this I haven't seen it in a couple of months, it's a rainy Friday evening and it's too far to the rental store... I'm going to get this movie on DVD asap. I'm not a very big fan of Michael Douglas but he plays his role very good and I couldn't think of anyone more appropriate for it. Actually, that goes for everyone in this film... The only bad thing about it is that once you've watched it, you've watched it. Wish I could go back and see it for the first time again.

8 July 2007,When does the game end?,"I read descriptions of the this film calling it a masterpiece and was compelled to comment. Whilst a great film on first watching, a masterpiece it is not...Whilst the Seven director did his best to draw out the suspense you could not really watch the later parts of this film without thinking...this is all a game. Whilst the end is powerful and gripping, you're still telling yourself in the back of the mind...this is all a game. And there is the problem. Only with a few fleeting moments do you really think this could be something more sinister, which was a trick missed i feel. This could have transpired into a wicked heist film. It's gripping, but not on your wallet, not enough Sean Penn and too much of Mikey Douglas. Worth a look.

12 March 2005,Incredible psycho-thriller,"The Game begins slowly and builds up suspense as more pieces get set into place. Michael Douglas is excellent, Sean Penn is convincing (you won't hear me say that often) and the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. The ending is a surprise, but consistent. Nicholas Van Horton (Michael Douglas) is a wealthy investment banker. On his 48th birthday (the same age his father committed suicide) his brother (Sean Penn) gives him a coupon for CRS (Consumer Recreation Services), a company that gives bored rich people the experience of a lifetime. And so it begins. By the time you reach the end, anything is possible. The ending is a surprise, but consistent, and different than many other movies in the genre. This ranks in the top ten with me.

5 August 2018,Greatly done.,"Greatly done film is why I appreciate it. I feel like I am a critic and this one should fall into a good suspense category! I love movies that change the perception of the viewer. It slowly builds, and is a very intriguing film. I agree the ending could be a little more profound but it still comes together well. It is able to bring you suspense without the in your face gore.

21 May 2023,What a waste of time,"I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. Starting potentially, I really like the concept and the mysterious thriller theme. However, this movie turns out to be the biggest disappointment with lots of plot holes and a confusing ending. At the beginning it shows a tragedy backstory and flashback, but does not connecting well with the rest of the movie. Nothing make sense, weak plot. Have watched far more better movies from David Fincher, this is unexpectedly bad.

The only good thing is the brilliant cast. I did not expect Michael Douglas much for this genre, but he actually did a very good job.
