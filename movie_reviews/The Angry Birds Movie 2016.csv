5 June 2016,"Surprisingly very entertaining, much better than it had a right to be",Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,7
23 May 2016,Pretty funny!!,So I never played the game before I should have done that before I saw it but the movie actually gave me a pretty good run through on how to play the game as well as tips on how to get far in the game and how to use all the birds in the game so that s cool They did a better job at it than the movies Battleship and Doom Loved all the voice talent in the movie lead by Jason Sudeikis who plays the Red bird with a hot temper whose force into anger management were he forms relationships with other angry birds Chuck played by Josh Gad Bomb played by Danny McBride and Terrance who was played brilliantly by Sean Penn They are the only one s who can help Red when he realizes the friendly Pigs that invaded their Island are up to something I loved the animation and the design of the characters It s very funny and entertaining,7
29 August 2016,I was really expecting to hate it.,ANGRY BIRDS Three Stars Out of Five Hit animated kids flick based on the immensely popular app video game series It tells the story of three misfit flightless birds with anger issues that must defend their island from mischievous green pig visitors The film stars the voice talents of Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad Danny McBride Bill Hader Peter Dinklage Maya Rudolph Kate McKinnon Keegan Michael Key Tony Hale Sean Penn and Blake Shelton It was directed by Clay Kaytis a veteran animator and Fergal Reilly a veteran storyboard artist of animated films both in their feature film directorial debuts It was written by Jon Vitti Mikael Hed Mikko Polla and John Cohen all veterans of animation The movie was a big hit at the Box Office and it received mostly positive reviews from fans but not so much from critics I liked it The film takes place on Bird Island an island inhabited by mostly happy but flightless birds Red Sudeikis is a loner bird with anger issues After he accidentally causes an egg to hatch early he s sentenced to anger management classes There he meets three other bird outcasts named Chuck Gad Bomb McBride and Terrence Penn Chuck and Bomb try to make friends with Red but Red refuses Then a ship arrives filled with strange green pigs that claim they just want to be friends Red is suspicious of their true intentions right away and he reluctantly enlists the help of Chuck and Bomb to figure out what the pigs are really up to The movie is a lot more entertaining than I thought it would be I was really expecting to hate it It s definitely simple silly and made primarily for kids but the animation is kind of cool and it s funny the voice cast is awesome I love Sudeikis Dinklage McBride Hader Gad Key and the rest and I think they made the film a lot more enjoyable It s definitely nothing that special but it s not bad or annoying either Watch our movie review show MOVIE TALK at  www youtube com watch v EoRwrYi1UcY,6

27 May 2016,Funny and touching,This film tells the story of an outcast bird in the bird community because of his anger problems and because of his thick eyebrows He saves the day when he recognises that pig visitors may have sinister intentions then they declare Yes I enjoyed played Angry Birds before but when they announced an Angry Birds movie I thought it was rather silly I thought there would be inadequate plot to fill up the screen time Hence I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the trailer It actually made me want to watch the film The film has a simple plot that is basically given away in the trailer Well you might just be able to figure it out even not having watched the trailer Nevertheless it is a funny film with lots of laughs I find the urination scene a bit tasteless and far too lengthy but each to their taste The ending is quite touching I enjoyed watching it overall,
22 May 2016,Silly and Derivative but Charming and Humor-Filled,Following along in similar footsteps as The Lego Movie The Angry Birds Movie manages to create a fun and thrilling feature length story out of something that didn t have any reason being a film in the first place While it doesn t have an overly intelligent script with a great moral story it s beautifully animated full of action and some timely humor for all ages As with every animated film these days bringing in world class voice talent is vitally important People like Jason Sudeikis Danny McBride Maya Rudolph Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage add some credibility to the film but unsurprisingly they are what sold the film to me with its comedic charm I think that s what this film is at its core charming It won t stick with you with grand themes like Zootopia or catchy songs like Frozen but it certainly made me laugh and that s all I was hoping for With all of the well timed adult humor there was a good amount of unnecessary potty humor that felt more like the filmmakers were reaching for laughs It s that type of desperate humor that overtakes the ridiculous joy out of seeing the birds angrily soar through the air from a slingshot toward pigs And yes to a certain extent you have to suspend your disbelief as to why birds simply can t fly in this film but hey that s canon in the game The central story of Red voiced by Sudeikis and his overcoming of his anger was very predictable and doesn t offer anything new with storytelling In fact his arc is overtly similar to that of Shrek in the 2001 film But I did enjoy seeing the dynamic of Red Chuck and Bomb as they attempt to uncover what it is the pigs are up to The script tends to veer off at times in the middle act as the trio travels to find the Mighty Eagle voiced by Dinklage but it picks up for a pleasantly heartwarming final act Surprisingly charming Voice talent Great animated action Silly humor reaches for laughs Unfocused middle act 7 3 10,7
20 May 2016,I can guarantee you this great movie will make you happy.,The movie takes place on Bird Island an untouched paradise inhabited by birds who are naive and innocent These good birds know nothing of the outside world They treasure eggs above all else and are all carefree and easygoing except for few One of these birds is Red a societal outcast who has had anger issues from the very beginning Eventually his outbursts become too much and he is sentenced to anger management courses where he meets other misfit birds with similar problems The birds are suddenly visited by green pigs who are dumb but funny The birds and pigs quickly befriend each other but Red does not trust the pigs at all Ultimately the pigs reveal their true colors and leads to Red leading the entire flock in a maddening frenzy of rightful revenge as well as finding the right means of dealing with rage Everything about this movie is impressive I can guarantee you this great movie will make you happy,10
17 May 2016,A laugh out loud kind of film,I absolutely loved this family friendly cartoon because it made me laugh out loud The animation in this movie is exquisite It is so detailed that you can clearly see all the feathers on the birds and tiny waves of the ocean When they show scenes of the town you can see the patch work on the houses and the real looking scenery Each character is unique because the creative animation matches their personalities This movie is about Red Jason Sudeikis a red bird who never fit in and has anger issues One day he has to go to an anger management class and meets the birds Bomb Matilda Chuck and Terence and they all become friends Then pigs come to the island on an unexpected visit They have parties with the birds and they give the birds weird gifts like trampolines and motorcycles and generally cause havoc in the town A horrible turn of events happens and Red and all of the other birds need to save the day My favorite scene is when Red attends anger management class Matilda the instructor talks with all the birds about their issues They participate in many funny exercises such as poetry writing and yoga This is a funny scene Red has the wrong attitude and is definitely negative and Matilda the instructor demonstrates some anger issues too My favorite character is Terence Sean Penn a giant red and black bird who doesn t really talk as much as he grunts His facial expressions are particularly funny Terence gets a lot of laughs from the audience and appears to be a crowd favorite The Angry Birds Movie is definitely a comedy Almost every scene even the sad ones have funny lines There is some humor that would make sense to older kids and adults but not little kids There are some parts that some adults might not feel comfortable with some of the content For example when the pigs slap their butts and joke about reproducing I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars because of the humor and recommend it for ages 4 to 18 It is a fun and silly animated movie about angry birds Who doesn t love angry birds If you like the game Angry Birds or just want to have a good laugh then The Angry Birds Movie is the movie for you It opens in theaters nationwide May 20 2016 so go check it out Reviewed by Mia A KIDS FIRST Film Critic,
22 May 2016,Not a bad movie but not for your 4-5 years old,You know what I went with my kids thinking I will get bored because the movie was rated around 6 10 I actually had more fun than the kids I ve watched the movie in 2D The characters are rather mature and some dialogues will appeal more to adults than to kids It is not a childish movie The battle scene is wayyy noisy long it lasts about 20 minutes and overwhelming I noticed several young kids in the theater lost patience and quit standing seat and were getting agitated Other than that the birds are nice looking I had no idea what this movie will be about as I m not a big game player but the story kinda keeps up well enough and the movie is dynamic at most moments,8
25 May 2016,All My Girlfriends Loved This Great Movie.,Angry Birds is a great movie for both children and adults The comedy is simply mesmerizing and the adventure is extremely entertaining On an island paradise populated almost entirely by happy flightless birds Red Jason Sudeikis a bird with a temper problem speedy Chuck Josh Gad and the volatile Bomb Danny McBride have always been outsiders But when the island is visited by mysterious green piggies who steal their eggs and carry them off to Piggy Island it s up to these unlikely outcasts to save the day and show the pigs including spokesman Leonard Bill Hader just how angry they can be Truly all my girlfriends in the cinema were laughing and having good times including me during this Excellent movie,10
14 May 2016,"Funny, colorful and brisk movie.",The Angry Birds Movie is funny colorful and brisk movie Somebody has said that movie is three years late but I don t think so It brings nostalgic feeling back from games and make them desirable again Story line is simple but it meanders nicely Movie is full with funny wordplay even so much that it is sometimes almost hard to follow all of them and this is promising for the movie You want to see it again to find all those puns Movies scenery is beautiful and colorful and all the action will satisfy younger audience Funny wordplay confidently satisfy more adult audience Familiar pop songs brings some nice nostalgic feeling for movie The story could be bit little more profound but to me movie is basic entertainment and nicely airy There are many references to other movie and that satisfy movie goers like me Animation is beautiful and colorful 3D brings nice depth to scenery and works nicely enough to counsel to see it in 3D In Finland we have also dubbed version of the movie but that didn t persuade me to test Maybe when BluRay version comes out I can try how they have dubbed those wordplay The story is underlay quite long but when they finally get s to action it feels familiarity with Angry Birds games Rarely comes out a good movie out of game but The Angry Birds Movie turns nicely to a movie It is shameless entertaining but it almost make me start to play all those old games again Good family entertainment,9
25 May 2016,"You'll be surprised, I was. Better than expected.",I honestly watched this with probably some of the lowest expectations Wow was I ever surprised How could a movie about Angry Birds a simple smart phone app game be any good Heck Hollywood can barely make a decent video game movie even one with an already great story But Angry Birds A game with a few cut scenes and a simple story Pigs steal eggs Birds try to get them back Well my hat is off to the writers and the actors Enough gushing Angry Birds does what a lot of great animated movies do Write a funny story that kids can follow along But also include enough inside jokes for the adults to get so that they can laugh too I m 46 and a father of a teen We both laughed a lot during it but I honestly think me and my 8yr old nephew enjoyed more than my 15yr old daughter The voice acting is perfect Jason and Josh do great job But honestly I think Josh steals the movie Josh Chuck has some of the greatest scenes and lines And he pulls them off even better than he did as Olaf in Frozen NOT A SPOILER shown in trailer For the fans of the game about half way through movie you finally get your nod When the birds attack the pigs we finally get a taste of the game But it doesn t take away from the movie as one might expect They did a great job of sling shooting the birds at the pig s buildings without taking away from the story I give it a 8 out of 10 great movie for the whole family I didn t give it a 9 or 10 because though it is probably the best movie it could of been It is a movie that probably could of been even better if it had nothing to do about a game So that they didn t have to include certain things But it is still a must see if you have kids or have ever played the game,8
22 May 2016,These angry birds will make you happy.,I can not believe how happy I became after watching this excellent movie Honestly speaking watching movies for children is a thing I rarely do But after watching the amazing trailer I made up my mind I must see it Angry Birds is a very funny movie We all need to laugh in these hard days because laughter makes our immunity high whereas sadness make our immunity weak The story of angry birds is about flightless birds who are happily living except for one who is called Red Poor bird he can t get over the daily problems that he has been facing in life His angry temper made him attend management class where he meets birds who have been suffering of disenchantment in life just like him Chuck and Bomb Red becomes outraged when his other fellow birds welcome green pigs to their island paradise As the swine begins to irritate him angry bird Red teams with his other angry birds Chuck and Bomb to investigate the real reason behind the sudden occupation of the pigs You will enjoy an excellent movie with superior comedy entertaining adventure and amazing 3 D from the beginning of this movie till the end This film is currently Number 1 in most countries and in the USA it went straight in at number 1 A proof this movie is successful and great,10
9 September 2021,"Hilarious, entertaining and moving.",Angry birds was a wonderful experience and I thoroughly recommend it to everyone of all ages The animation is great the music is wonderful the voice acting is stellar and you ll get a lot of laughs out of it I hope The plot is simple and the characters are likeable and there s a nice amount of emotion to this film as well Not much to dislike unless your not into silliness and light hearted fun,9
5 July 2016,"""A-well-a, everybody's heard about the bird Bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word.""",Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,8
29 May 2016,Funny and relatable,I ve never played or cared about Angry Birds before but I still decided to try this movie And I m quite glad I did for it is a lot better than I expected It is silly and hilarious but it still has a decent plot moral and some emotion The animation is very lively and colorful The main character is a grumpy bird called Red whom I m sure many people would find relatable Life just doesn t treat him well and so he acts rather angry leading others to believe he s a terrible bird when all he wants is some peace The other characters besides Red are likable too and all have their own unique personalities Most of the gags in the movie didn t make me laugh out loud but that s okay because there was still plenty of comedy to enjoy and most of it made me laugh on the inside There were many adult jokes but most of them weren t blatant enough to be much of a worry if there s a young kid watching The gross out humor was distasteful of course but there wasn t as much of it as I thought there d be I expected more fart jokes but thankfully there weren t The puke joke was unappealing but luckily it was only a few seconds the pee joke is what really bothered me because it was really awkward and lasted way too long There are some heart warming moments and character revelations throughout the movie particularly near the end but I shan t be specific to avoid spoilers The movie mostly focuses on making viewers laugh but there are still other reasons to watch it such as a nice moral about having faith in yourself and trusting yourself to do the right thing Anyone who knows Angry Birds could have predicted the plot and the moral s been done before but it s still an enjoyable watch,7
11 June 2016,A good treat for everyone,The Angry Birds Movie a fast fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that at its zenith had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens Rich in color energy and perfectly dreadful puns this film adaptation of the Finnish gaming phenomenon surpasses all cynical expectations The voice of Jason Sudeikis for Mr Red was fantastic and the movie made justice to the Angry Birds games we enjoy playing The Angry Birds Movie is way better than most viewers would expect I enjoyed the movie very much and hope the viewers would be getting same satisfaction when they play the game I go with 7 10 for this amazingly crafted movie,7

3 June 2016,Angry Birds deliver,The Angry Birds Movie deliver one of the best animated comedies ever created for families You and your family will love all of the laughs in this once in a life time experience that you will never forget trust me It has a lot of heart that will make you feel good inside and never want to leave it Parents this movie has no profanity but there are spots where you know where there should be profanity like what the cluck The movie will make your kids super happy and the 3D glasses are sick in a good way This is one of the best 3D movies I have ever seen the animation is wonderful I hope that you enjoy this movie as much as I did because it is a hint of fresh air that you will love forever and ever it is truly magical rock on Blake Shelton Demi Lovato,10
21 May 2016,Not What I Expected,I think that because my expectations were so low going in I ended up really enjoying this movie The promotional footage and images with the bright colors and goofy character designs made me think that this movie was being targeted for really little kids but DON T BE FOOLED This is definitely aimed for the 10 and older demographic as evidenced by all the pee jokes and innuendos That being said I was delightfully surprised by the clever humor beautiful animation and insanely fun climax I must say though that this movie s greatest achievement is having one of the best voice casts I ve ever seen Jason Sudeikis is a strong center to the film and his deadpan delivery makes me upset that he is no longer attached to that Fletch reboot Bill Hader creates a Gregory Peck George C Scott like persona as the villainous Leonard Peter Dinklage almost steals the show as the a flawed icon of the birds There s also some great work being done by the likes of Maya Rudolph Kate McKinnon Keegan Michael Key and of all people Sean Penn and it s fun to hear some great TV actors like Tony Hale Danielle Brooks Ike Barinholtz and Tituss Burgess in smaller roles The highlights though are Josh Gad and Danny McBride who help create two of the most memorable sidekicks in modern film animation While watching this movie I kept comparing it to Zootopia While Zootopia had a much more original premise and all around creativity Angry Birds was stronger in terms of humor and all around enjoyment which I think comes from the simplicity of the story and characters,7
8 May 2016,Thank You Angry Birds,Dear Angry Birds Thank you for the fantastic movie Me love the movie so much I buy all you re games and toys because your birds are angry and funny The animation in the movie was superb Everything looked like the game but more real and better My favorite bird is the red bird because he s the main one but I also like Yellow and Fatso All the characters were funny and good development I laughed at all the jokes and so did my dad sometimes Please make more it was sooooooooooo good I almost had a heart attack watching my favorite characters come to life on the big screen So big and come to life Great movie From Bird,10
26 May 2016,Slightly Tepid Birds,My review of Angry Birds spoiler free 1 2 Cast Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad Danny McBride Maya Rudolph Bill Hader and Golden Globe winner Peter Dinklage Plot overview Find out why the birds are so angry When an island populated by happy flightless birds is visited by mysterious green piggies it s up to three unlikely outcasts Red Chuck and Bomb to figure out what the pigs are up to Angry Birds has been a worldwide phenomenon for many years now and usually movies based on games especially mobile games don t normally get a good reception but this this is probably the best game based movie I have ever seen When the movie was announced by Sony a lot of people gave a bad name straight away but then again so did I but when it was released the people who gave it a bad name liked it When I saw it I thought it was a really fun animation and an a really interesting take on a mobile game The reasons why I think this is a must see animation Origin Angry Birds started life as a mobile game and it s popularity just exploded in a matter of months Just to think seven years later it still remains to be extremely popular and a with a unique adaptation I think it will still be popular many years to came Action The action is a formidable choice for a movie like this but I think it was a good choice because the action is well used and well made if a little flat but I ll get to that in a second With the characters having their own unique fighting skill it certainly shows that the people who made this made a good adaptation it was very funny and fun for the whole family My initial mark for this movie was going to be 8 out of 10 but the reason for the actual mark is because it fell flat here is the reason why that is Much like the game When the movie go to the action part I thought it was fun at first but then it fell a little flat because the movie started to look like the game which isn t a bad thing but it s not a good thing either Other than that fact I thought this was a well made silly and fun animation that the whole family will love Verdict Silly fun and just a good time if a little flat near the end 7 10 recommended 2012 Best performance by an actor in a Supporting Role Series Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television Game of Thrones 2011,7

15 August 2016,"Rich in color, energy and perfectly dreadful puns, this film adaptation of the Finnish gaming phenomenon surpasses all cynical expectations.",Agreeability gets you so far in life but when the chips are down it helps to lose your temper sometimes That s a pretty unexpected moral takeaway for a kids movie and it s just one surprise of many in The Angry Birds Movie a fast fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that at its zenith had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens Establishing a basic psychological motivation for the fiery disposition shared by the feathered folk of Bird Island this irreverent origin story takes an appropriately loose elastic approach to its larger narrative with frequent detours to fill in daffier details of its mad mad mad mad story world,7

13 April 2021,Corporate Fantasy or Inclusive Parable?,Actually it wasn t as bad as my review s title suggests My biggest problem is that birds are not well represented they re lazy gullible or angry And they re not even real birds they re fantasy video game birds So if you re looking for an entertainment experience closer to avian reality see for example Swift or possibly Rio it strikes me that birds are under represented in anthropomorphic animation and puppetry But what did I expect from a movie that tries to make a story out of a video game app Positive notes my kids liked it better than I did and my son in particular who knows a lot about authentic birds laughed hilariously at the slap stick bird launching from the slingshot at the end And the idea that a society should listen to people that are stigmatized for emotional cognitive difference e g too angry is an important one,7
27 May 2016,Thoroughly entertaining for kids & adults alike.,The Angry Birds Movie is based on the smart phone game app Angry Birds Red Jason Sudeikis has been an outcast his entire life He lives on an island inhabited by joyous flightless birds However Red is the exception He is a bird who is always in a bad mood When some green pigs led by Leonard Bill Hader visit Bird Island Red begins to suspect them questions their motives He takes the help of Chuck Josh Gad Bomb Danny McBride to find out what the pigs are up to The Angry Birds Movie is an extremely hilarious entertaining film Directors Clay Kaytis Fergal Reilly stay faithful to the basic premise of the game while also masterfully expanding on it The makers of the film give the iconic birds pigs a much needed origin story Now we finally know how it all began Don t worry though You don t have to compulsorily play the game to enjoy the film Newcomers will love it just as much The animation is spectacular The 3D is perfect When the birds start launching from the catapult you feel like you are right in the middle of the game The dialog delivery of the voice cast elevates the film to new levels of hilarity Jason Sudeikis is outstanding as Red Sudeikis perfectly captures Red s cynicism Josh Gad is mind blowing as Chuck Gad voices Chuck with the same enthusiasm that he had when he voiced Olaf in Frozen 2013 Danny McBride is fantastic as Bomb I like the fact that McBride subtly changes his voice to portray Bomb Maya Rudolph is awesome as Matilda Bill Hader is superb as Leonard Peter Dinklage is hysterical as Mighty Eagle Sean Penn is impressive as Terence Keegan Michael Key is great as Judge Peckinpah Kate McKinnon is good as Stella Tony Hale is hilarious as Mime The supporting cast is effective The Angry Birds Movie is a must watch for the entire family Whether you love the game or not,9

18 September 2016,Never underestimate the power of Birds...And Eggs!,The first thing that was lovable is the graphics The detailing used is really dazzling and all the footage I ve seen is impressively pretty and the designs are well done The movie is an enjoyable one and at the end of the day you might smile thinking of some cute scenes inside There are few surprising scenes that you won t expect in these kind of flicks A good extension to the game franchise that glued children of almost all ages to the mobile I have now started finding better movies through www flickstree com It not only suggests great movies to watch it also tells where you can watch the movie online Highly recommended,8

21 May 2016,"""Why So Angry?""",Rovio Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment built a great final product within the limits of cinematographic quality adaptations about video games Despite of that the fame of the digital game already isn t in vehemence it did in 2009 when Finnish Rovio games company decided to sell a video game based on angry birds and green pigs So huge was its success that seven years later a film adaptation has been established in the theaters around the world while retaining the same color palette of the game its main characters and even a song from the original However its characters aren t the only ones angry spectators are really angry to see the silly and unbalanced screenplay of the story In certain way the extravagant colors cheap jokes and even references manage to hide that lack even so lack is evident Nevertheless Angry Birds Movie is the greater favorite video game adaptation in the summer season with the support of adolescents adults and most children At least at the box office amass more fortune than its competitors due to the level of recognition although Warcraft and Assassin s Creed may give the fight Fortunately Sony film is not worthy of the ratings and opinions negative by the audience well at least not of all The expectations for this film were too low due to the complicated and arduous work to create a story with so few elements adding to this the little experience evidenced in previous adaptations of electronic games Sony gets to engage in a true animated movie failing in its terrible script creating lack of chemistry and consistency not very present in neighboring companies Diney Pixar and even Dreamworks Bird design is beautiful majestic and excellently projected its colors textures personalities and sizes make this adventure a real game of Angry Birds We meddle in its main scarcity The Lego Movie is a clear reference of a flawless screenplay Perhaps screenplay by Jon Vitti Alvin and the Chipmunks is simple and limited by the almost nil tools on which they are based hampering the creation of characters more deep They thought that by being a film directed mainly to the public children the plot should be simple and clear without much depth or complexity in order to solve the basic questions of the game Why are angry the Angry Birds In an anthropomorphic world all kinds of birds coexist in a peaceful fun colorful and friendly place an island all but Red voiced by Jason Sudeikis a embittered and resentful bird with life since child due to his physical appearance his temperament was not the best and he is forced to attend classes to control his anger with the beautiful and delicate Matilda voiced by Maya Rudolph There he finds to his three companions of adventures Chuck voiced by Josh Gad an animated yellow canary with speed powers with a clear scene referenced to Quicksilver X MEN Bomb voiced by Danny McBride a black bomb shaped bird which cannot control his temper and simply explodes and finally and less present Terrence voiced by Senn Pean a biggish red bird with noble feelings The group of misfits will have to save their city from the dangerous and malicious green pigs an unprecedented adventure began Angry Birds pleases to infants with a predictable colorful and entertaining story but also meets with ironic humor to the public adult with perfect and clear references to The Shining X MEN and classic Tex Avery gags If the screenplay had not been so redundant in the themes and repetitive objectives in animated films the family the hero save your city happy ending would be the perfect blend with high quality graphic effects We consider this film like a game of Angry Birds where all pigs have been defeated but the final score doesn t reaches three stars of score,7

29 July 2016,Could've been better,Angry Birds Movie is a movie based off of the hit game app called Angry Birds There was also a cartoon that came out back in 2013 called Angry Birds Toon which has also received mediocre reviews and may have also been an unnecessary adaptation though I haven t seen it But what s different is that this one gives the birds legs and dialogue to work with It stars Red a hot headed red bird who reacts childishly to almost everything Now I am not a fan of irritable characters but in some scenes I could see why the things that annoy him would be annoying like for instance a bird sitting next to you sneezing on your popcorn while you re trying to enjoy a movie Red and his friends the crybaby Bomb and the hyperactive crazy Chuck encounter pigs who want to destroy the island So the kind hearted Red and his friends must do something to try to stop them which includes acting angry and using slingshots while also using special powers now I don t remember that in the game The character Chuck is usually really annoying I don t see what s the deal with him zipping around but they could ve developed his character more He rarely has his moments where he s being kind but unfortunately it s stopped by Red who s better but is still a mediocre character Bomb sometimes whines and it gets pretty annoying Terrence is probably the best character out of this that I could think of He s above average as he can be a little too aloof but his grunts are pretty funny and he does have some redemption towards the end His character is inconsistent overall The movie tries to stay true to the franchise but it has some unrealistic moments like the birds using special powers now I don t know if there is a game where that could happen but if there isn t put that in a game And I don t know how the baby birds can sing that well already and the village be restored that fast The animation and character designs are kind of cute they do have some flaws but they re alright This was an unnecessary corny adaptation to the game Though it wasn t as bad as I thought it would be it does have some funny moments It relies unnecessarily on crude humor And the mid credits scenes were annoying,5

2 June 2016,So plucking better than the game!,OK first off the idea of a movie from a game sounded like a sure flop to me hello Mario Brothers But I must say the story and the animation were awesome and the anger so real you wanna join in There are many wisecracks some Kleenex moments and just plenty of things shooting out of those birds rears so much to make it worth your time If you have a wee person who could never put your phone down playing the game this movie is sure to make that obsession shoot through the sky,10
2 June 2016,Great movie,I think the movie was a great movie It had a good plot and was the right length of time There wasn t too many funny parts like the rhyme if you add to much sugar it will become to sweet I didn t give it a 10 because it wasn t my type of movie but i know it will be lots of children s favorite movie for a long time It is also a movie parents will enjoy It is exactly like the game but turned into a story and plot Positives Both parents and children will enjoy it Great plot Right amount of time Wasn t to many funny parts,8

13 May 2016,Angry birds is a must see ! This movie will solve all your anger issues,I loved the movie I have never played the game The story line was fast page and engaging The animation was excellent This is a kids movie however it reaches out To all ages I saw 3 year old kids and Grandparents in the audience laughing at the same jokes Even thou it was based on app that had billion downloads The story stands on it own It has important lessons through out However nothing that was over the top Reds character certainly Teaches us lessons On anger what happens when we loose control Why it s import to mange our anger Of course you will see yourself in one The characters I have decided I am chuck and sometimes bomb Enjoy,10
29 July 2016,You'll feel like you've had a bird crap and vomit on you,3 4 of 10 If having a bird crap and vomit on you is your idea of a good time you may enjoy the green pork and white eggs this film offers I m not sure how they coaxed Sean Penn into this Maybe a favor for a friend The rest of the cast isn t surprising or add anything to it Probably just happy to get a good paying Sony gig The animation and drawing is solid more natural and better than a game so game and cartoon lovers might get some enjoyment out of that But beyond the technical visual and sound aspects the story and characters are disappointing and poorly thought out About the only story element that I enjoyed involved how communities openly trusting and welcoming of traveling carnival acts passing through town are likely to be conned and lose heavily in the deal,3
16 May 2016,Awesome !,So I m almost 30 yo Not the appropriate age to watch Angry Birds right Well I did it anyway Great decision I m not that crazy about animation movies I really enjoyed Zootopia I laughed at Kung Fu Panda I would maybe watch Ice Age again but I d rather watch a decent thriller than a really good cartoon I went into the cinema not knowing what to expect the trailer was funny and appealing but after all it s a movie made after a silly game oh yeah I m not crazy about the game either Then it started I enjoyed every single part of it Literally I wouldn t change a thing about it I mean yeah the story could be a bit more complex but it s a video game You can t make a LOTR like story based on a game with exploding birds I just loved the characters every single one of them being funny as hell The jokes were brilliant I had to force myself to stop laughing at one point because my stomach was aching I still had a smile on my face 2 hours after the movie ended I never thought I could enjoy a cartoon so much I could watch it all over again today and not regret a single moment This might just be the best cartoon I ever saw,9
21 May 2016,Finally a kids movie with a healthy message,It s been a long time since a movie didn t make my kids curious and ask serious questions Don t be fooled by the childish look of the movie the situation in which the birds are is problematic and unheard of in the game In short you identify easily to Red rightfully angered in a crowd of apathetic birds but using his anger to fix things angry birds style The movie kindly makes fun of today s hip culture which leads teens to follow all those narrow minded so called e celebrities and become adults with no character no personality and no good role models except reality TV empty shells The movie does a great job at transcribing our current world in the game universe You ll notice some winks that you kids won t notice but nothing that only an adult should understand if you get what I mean I am very pleased to have brought my kids to a long awaited movie with good morals instead of the mainstream don t listen to your parents or marry the first cool guy you see narrative,10
15 May 2016,Lots of fun( for me AND KIDS),It s been about twenty years or some since I ve been to animated movie MULAN very nice indeed But Angry Birds movie just swept me away fun detailed humorous likeble and even details for an adult which children can understand but in different way you know Water was incredible And the attitude nice change for all this pretty love and easy loving main character I did love the main character because of his coming out of a box being himself and Terence please can I hear your response especially Sean Penn 3D was good work anticipating for a sequel I hope people will find this great movie which is not all about man and woman getting together somehow like almost every movie is all about to get homo sapiens male and female in the business you know Everyone can relate to this,10
25 May 2016,Angry but still cute,Best movie for kids playing angry bird Don t waste time thinking that if that it isn t worth it for wasting time and money Believe me it is great Great story and really funny And forget about the old saying that don t fight with the pig you will get dirty and moreover the pig likes it Best animated film Angry but still cute And most of us had played angry bird once in our life Pigs are cute and cunning but will the birds over smart them angry is good Could be the best film of the year Can t wait for angry bird being smashed in the wall It s got great voices for the birds Life of bird is good Don t get it watch the film to know about it Angry birds look great with hand and legs Watch the film and rate it today,8
27 December 2018,Download the app instead,Normally films based on video games aren t that good but The Angry Birds Movie yeah it isn t the exception to that rule It s not good The story characters voice acting and animation are all pretty bland and the humor falls flat despite the comedic cast I almost laughed once in this movie but that s it Do yourself a favor and download the app instead of watching the movie playing the game is much more satisfying,3
15 May 2016,Pretty good.,While the story isn t the best this film is good for kids and has plenty of good things about it I enjoyed it I really liked the animation it was pleasant to look at and was very colourful The characters were pretty likable too I like some of the main characters most While I haven t played much angry birds from what I know it had quite a few elements from the games in the movie which I know not all video game movies do the best The humour isn t the best but it will make younger children giggle and there were a few funny moments I recommend this film to young kids,7
25 May 2016,Great Family FIlm,Amazing FILM teaches many great lessons fun for all the family teaches the importance of channeling your anger and the importance of nationalism I will buy this once it comes out I loved the character of Red he is a vert realistic character He will act as a good role model for kids much better than the Zoophilia beastiality nonsense It also teaches healthy gender roles and has great animation I m looking forward to more by this studio King Mudbeard was a frightening villain as well,9
16 June 2016,As Enjoyable as I wanted it to be,This is a movie that I was ACTUALLY looking forward to see I ve been a fan of the game from it s inception and I ve played it a lot ever since I would never call myself a die hard fan but I enjoy the games enough to watch any animations that come out of this product Saying that the angry birds toons were wonderfully made that one Star Wars short they did was beautifully animated so for this movie I was at the very least expecting great animation with striking visuals That is EXACTLY what I got and that alone would put this movie on a 6 out of 10 Animation wise this movie is BEAUTIFUL probably the best animated movie in the sense that the visuals have been the most interesting I ve seen so far this year Surpassing Kung Fu Panda 3 and Zootopia I find this movie so colourful and pleasant to watch I could watch this movie on mute and STILL enjoy it to it s fullest In story it is very weak Mighty eagle in particular felt very clich do they do play around with his clich character a bit but not enough to be very funny Also very predictable storyline you can pretty much guess what s going to happen by just watching the trailers However what elevates this from a 6 to 7 for me is the character of RED whom I found surprisingly relatable Keep in mind I was just expecting this movie to make me laugh and entertain me a bit but I found myself really identifying with RED s cynicism and arc Being a grump because of how people treat him and have treated him in the past but still desiring to hang out like a normal bird with everyone else even though he s unable to open up to start a relationship with anyone So I was very pleased with his resolution Overall if you like the game watch the movie Worst case scenario you ll enjoy it but never want to watch it again,6
25 November 2020,"This an okay movie, and nowhere as bad as the critics said",This was surprisingly enjoyable Not great but enjoyable An okay movie for kids I don t know why it got so much hate from critics back then For a movie inspired by a videogame this was pretty decent,7
23 May 2016,A Return to The Golden Age of Animation,Animation is a bigger industry then it has ever been in the past shattering records and setting new standards but a lot of them feel like live action films that have been dressed up in GCI clothing It s a good step toward making animation a serious medium but there was a time when animation had its own comedic style that just wouldn t work in live action Enter the Angry Birds movie Based on the popular smartphone game Angry Birds hearkens back to the golden age of animation especially the Road Runner cartoons The action is energetic and the comedic delivery is always on time There are also a lot of Blink and you ll miss them sight gags as well as some subtle adult humor which the golden age was also known for There isn t one joke that feels out of place and every character has some humorous quirk that works to the film s advantage like Red being a cynical pessimist and Chuck being hyperactive These characters are brought to life by an all star cast who clearly took their roles very seriously and it shows My favorite is probably Peter Dinklage as the Mighty Eagle who the movie portrays as an egotistical superhero type character who is well past his prime The animation itself is beautifully rendered looking practically photo realistic while still being exaggerated and cartoonish The birds are more anthropomorphic than they were in the game having arms and legs and living on a tropical island The same can be said for the pigs who have also been given more human like features and personalities The environments are more realistic than cartoonish but they still have some exaggerated elements that complement the film s tone and characters If you re looking for a dramatic and thought provoking animated film then you won t find it here I recommend Zootopia in that case but if you want to experience the wacky and energetic style that the golden age was known for then I recommend the Angry Birds movie,8
21 May 2016,Kids movie that all the family will love,Very well made movie with great characters and a strong message My sons LOVED it they want to go see it again in the theater next week I m gonna buy the Blu ray for sure there aren t many kids movies as good as this Animation was of a very high quality the music was catchy as hell and the voice acting superb I wasn t expecting a movie based on the angry birds game to be any good but I was totally blown away so far this year it could be the best movie I ve seen period I don t want to spoil anything so I ll just say there are a lot of unexpected twists and you root for the hero all of the way,10
23 June 2016,Best cartoon ever,I can not believe how happy I became after watching this excellent movie After watching the amazing trailer It is noting you have to see the movie for enjoy it The story of angry birds is about flightless birds who are happily living except for one who is called Red Red did not satisfy with his life because he have many problems with other birds so he get angry His angry temper made him attend management class where he meets birds who have been suffering of disenchantment in life just like him Chuck and Bomb The birds are suddenly visited by green pigs who are dumb but funny The birds and pigs quickly befriend each other but Red does not trust the pigs at all Angry bird Red investigate the real reason behind the sudden occupation of the pigs Angry bird Red with his teams including speedy Chuck Josh Gad and the volatile Bomb Danny McBride and legend eagle destroyed pig s plan which was stealing bird s eggs and eating them Finally red with his friends found the way to live happy in bird s island and they become hero,10
1 August 2016,"It is not so bad, more is well below expectations",My expectations for The Angry Birds Movie was bad plus the film at least not as bad as people are saying more is not good dubbing cast it s good Jason Sudeikis Bill Vader Josh Gad Sean Penn Danny McBride and etc the animation is funny plus the pace of the film is bad takes too long for the fight scenes between pigs and birds are almost an hour of stalling more for the final battle is really fun has good jokes the trail sound is good if you like the game your experience with this animation can be even better the Angry Birds movie is a funny and fun animation the characters are good fun more unfortunately the film is full of problems it takes too long for expected battle Pigs vs birds Note 5 9,5
3 June 2016,an amazing film!!!,when i first heard that they were making a movie out of the angry birds concept i expected it to be trash But this surpassed my expectations by through its good script and humour i congratulate the directors in making a good film out of a very small concept the birds are really adorable and the whole thing is a pleasure to watch the pigs are also better than i expected the film has an amazing style special mention for the voice over for all the characters which were really apt for the character this film reminds me why i keep watching animation thank you for this adorable film,9
14 May 2016,Watch the birdy!,I recently saw the film with my wife and two children 7 and 9 and we all really enjoyed it The story has enough visual gags and toilet humour to keep most children amused as well as a few adults too and uses it s gaming app heritage to good effect within the very simple story line All the Angry Bird characters make an appearance but with the focus on Red Chuck and Bomb The quality of the animation is excellent and complimented to good effect with the actors voices making it both fun to watch and listen to Some of the slapstick humour reminded me of the old Looney tunes cartoons particularly when the birds are propelled into battle against the pigs while many of the visual jokes in the background are so quick and subtle blink and you ll miss them If you and your kids liked the movie Surfs up then you will probably like this one however you may see similarities in some of the characters Mighty Eagle is just a variation on the Big Z character from Surfs up A film based on a gaming app isn t going to be deep and meaningful but if you just want feel good family entertainment and a good laugh then you won t go far wrong with The Angry Birds Movie,8
15 May 2016,Kinda Unexpected,This movie was unexpectedly good I went into the cinema knowing nothing of it I didn t even like the game It was very nice to watch an animated movie not made by Pixar It was full of bird and pig jokes I watched it in Hungarian language and it didn t become boring even at the end of the film From a peaceful start it became action packed but at the same time it became less interesting for me There are a lot of reference to the open world so you need a little knowledge about it I agree with the PEGI 6 rating it can be easily understood by anyone I really liked the feature that I could unlock new levels on the game with the end credits song It was a nice touch,8
12 May 2016,Great movie equally for adults as to children,Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,9
14 August 2016,What makes the birds to get so angry?,Video games to films is an old topic to discuss it now but the fans from the original source are always in the high hope when they hear news like this Because Angry Birds game is one of the mainstream games which is originally from Finland Despite the mixed reviews it is a box office success and definitely a sequel on the card After lots of animal themed films now in the line of underrated animation Free Birds another the bird s quest begins with this I m not much into this game but I was looking forward to the film since it was first announced Now I m here after the watch and I think is a good film but better suitable for children than the adults That did not stop me from enjoying it The target audience might be the kids with those cute film characters as well as the story but there are some dialogues that are written keeping in mind the grownups Anyway most of the adults won t feel they are in a wrong cinema hall if they regularly watch animation films especially in the present world animations are accepted as for all ages So this is the story about the Red an orphan bird lives in a small house on the sea shore The kids from the island loves him but the adults stay away from him for his bad anger attitude One day a ship of pigs arrives on the bird s island offering friendship but their intention was later known once the valuables things were stolen from them So the revenge and rescue operation begins which stretched with full of action adventure in the remaining parts Filled with lots of fun moments it was much better than I expected Sometimes it looked cute but you know our angry bird Red with his companions makes it not to stay that way Peter Dinklage as Might Eagle was one of the highlights of the film and the rest of the cast did well too It is definitely a great directional debute for the two experienced animators Makes a bit sad how the film was received but after seeing it myself I think its fine Different people have different opinion In my perspective it was a good watch so I surely suggest it especially for animation fans and obviously children 7 10,7
21 May 2016,An amazing movie!,I went to see this movie with my son today and i surprisingly had a good time The cinematics are good humour was quite on point and it had a great moral in the movie Some might argue that the movie came a little bit too late but i tend to disagree My son remembered the main characters and was happy to see them It s important to teach our kids that we not only have to stand up for ourselves but also for others A moral you don t get to see a lot these days Take your family or friends to the movie and have a blast,9
31 May 2016,This movie made me feel understood,Really enjoyed this movie One of the few animated ones that I actually liked It s different in a way but I can t pinpoint what specifically I liked about it The overall feel was just right and I guess I connected with Red the main bird character An invasion of pigs disturbing the peace of a good natured bird people and with an evil intent to abuse the hospitality which they were offered so dearly And the inevitable backlash when the peaceful birds rediscover their angry side and decide to retake what is theirs Being a young man from Germany maybe the theme resonated with me I couldn t help but draw some parallels to the political situation in my country Maybe I m interpreting too much here but the movie is still worth a watch It definitely had some funny scenes which have made me laugh for minutes straight The characters were made with love and I m sure there s at least one that you will really like,9

9 August 2021,Really entertaining,This movie has several elements that differentiate it from other animated movies One of them is that of a couple of charming characters the pig king and the mighty eagle The rest are still classic archetypes one is restless the other shy the other struggling for a bit of dignity Things get out of hand after a pig plan to take the eggs from the birds to possibly make an omelette The rescue occurs and everyone is happy and we have a new hero in town There are hilarious moments like when they go for a mighty eagle and end up discovering the key to a heavenly lake The movie is entertaining and can be watched multiple times without guilt,7

26 July 2016,Average - mediocre,Nothing special really Some good ideas here and there some laughs but nothing to die for Being an adult that loves this kind of movies this is just my adult opinion Watching this one was money and time wasted It was really compatible to the Rovio concept of the game with some nice links to it but apart from that I think that nothing else was great about this movie Come to think of it from the children perspective I am not sure how it can be OK to have a bird that can explode and then continue to live like nothing happened I mean I know that kids are not stupid but what will happen if someone gets the notion that they can blow up and then go about their way doing the next thing I mean isn t this too dangerous Maybe I am being paranoid but this fact certainly stood out Anyway overall don t even think about wasting your time with this one Definitely not worth it Better luck next time Rovio,6

22 June 2016,And I Thought the Game Ruffled My Feathers,The entire concept of birds sacrificing themselves to knock pigs off construction sets is easily an idea I could have come up with last Friday night at 2 30am after a strong overdose But who cares right That s what makes Angry Birds so oddly engaging to play So of course this is the perfect material to make a motion picture out of And you know what The Angry Birds Movie is the most beautiful most thoughtful experience I ve ever sat through in a cinema met with some wonderful characters hilarious gags and a message that is suitable for all ages Ha Had you there didn t I Gosh I almost had to force myself to type that Right from this film s announcement I was expecting this movie to be just a series of super unfunny gags only toddlers would find funny along with a real overused message to make this feel like somewhat of a complete movie And sure enough the result met all my expectations to the tee I mean come on I have always enjoyed the iPhone game but how could a 97 minute story of these birds possibly be decent Well just like this Step 1 You make the main character an underdog with an anger issue who is disrespected by the town Step 2 You set up his team through an anger management class Step 3 You introduce the green pigs as the main villains a quarter of the way through the movie Step 4 You make the main character the only one in the town who knows how to stop these bad pigs Step 5 You let these bad pigs steal the eggs of the birds in the town in order to eat them Step 6 You make the town s savior an absolute moron who the main character loses hope in Step 7 You save the actual game playing part until the final moments and only for five minutes tops Step 8 You throw in puns Lots and lots of puns I ve gone crazy now after hearing Happy hatch day Pluck my life Insta ham and Kevin Bacon in Hamlet But you know what Toucan play at this If this movie can go mad with bird and pig puns so can I The movie s egg selent screenwriter Jon Vitti got his start writing adult comedies such as SNL and The Simpsons and maybe he should have left his nest there While he does sprinkle in some jokes that will fly over the kids heads a majority of the humor here is winging it toward the 12 and younger crowd But maybe that s not the problem Maybe the problem is that he wrote out each character rather faithfully to their virtual counterparts yet entirely unmotivated and all around fowl Every bird and pig in this movie is either A Useless B Rude C Dumb D All the above Owl go with option D You know that white egg shaped bird named Matilda She s the teacher of the anger management class now and is all sweet and calm despite being an angry bird Then that yellow triangle shaped bird named Chuck is voiced by Josh Gad and he is literally Olaf on crack His best friend is that black bomb bird and together they are so annoying that you ought to flip the bird at each of them The enormous bird named Terence is the closest thing to funny this movie gets to and he just flew right by without enough screen time Then there s the little blue bird that splits into three who doesn t even show up until the end credits scene Oh and I guess there s Red Yeah no comment The world of these birds is also rather cheep Basically it is all recreated from the designs in the game as well as the Toon series I m sure it is a beautiful and creative world on screen but I couldn t exactly tell as everything in the frame was moving too fast for me to get a good look at the details But essentially the most genius thing they come up with is a pregnant bird carrying her egg strapped onto her stomach like a pregnant human Yeah seriously what the duck The jokes probably would have quacked me up if the animators actually took a breather in between each pratfall and each piece of rapid fire dialogue Also if some jokes were removed entirely that would help enormously By jokes I mean nipple gags a bird beating up a statue a malfunctioning stairway and an eagle peeing into a pond for a full minute yes this movie actually resorts to that hawkward level of humor Okay fine maybe there are a few redeeming messages It does try to affirm that anger is good motivation to fighting for the right causes but it s entirely forgotten by the last few moments and is even deliberately mocked by the characters themselves So yeah no important values to be found here I m talon you if a movie about the Angry Birds really needed to exist then it should have be done by artists who actually gave a hoot to the kids and the parents who had the birden of allowing the ticket prices to go on their bill But even judging by an Angry Birds fan this movie is not boosting the popularity of the franchise in any way If anything it s just going to hurt the franchise So stick with the game there s no peeing eagles Overall Grade F,1
17 March 2017,So much fun,The Angry Birds movie is so much fun Of course there are some crude jokes but that s typical to any kind of movie I think having an American I m assuming screenwriter affects the movie a lot It makes it easier to gain a larger audience world wide I m astonished by the English speaking cast First of all Jason Sudeikis as the lead Peter Dinklage as the Mighty Eagle and Sean Penn as the big guy who basically doesn t even say anything The cast speaks what kind of a big deal this movie was to make Very funny movie but of course very typical plot wise But that s how it is with most animated mainstream children s movies,7
11 June 2016,Angry Bird Movie - 'Make America Great Again',Took my grandchild to see the Angry Birds movie today and was so amazed to see the characters in the movie coincide so well with what is currently going on in America and the political elections of 2016 Go see this movie and see if you notice that the Birds represent the American people who are so angry with the establishment politicians who are screwing up a Great America The Pigs in the movie represent the establishment politicians and the far left liberals and deadbeat living off the government who are determined to transform our great nation that we have worked so hard to build These Pigs put on a fake face and tell lies to try to convince the Birds that they are here to take care of them and show them a great time just like the establishment politicians are doing us The Pigs are really after stealing the eggs which represent the Great America we have built The Angry Bird named Red represents Donald Trump who is the one Angry Bird who recognizes the Pigs establishment for what they really are and is ultimately able to expose them Of course Red takes a lot of push back and blame from all the birds who have fallen for the propaganda the Pigs are feeding them Great Movie Of course my grandchild picked up on none of this,10
29 July 2016,I did not enjoy it...,There are animated movies shows that address adults like Rick and Morty there are some that address young and old alike Zootopia for example and there are some that address primarily young audiences Angry Birds is in my opinion addressing only the young The story was kind of flat the style and quality was not much better than an average computer game cut scene and the jokes were mostly greeted with silence in the theater But i will not blame the movie for it too much The source material is a mobile game without something resembling much of a story The characters from the game are meant to usually possess one characteristic and that is it So considering the source material the movie did pretty well indeed compared to other movies however it was rather boring But like i said maybe a younger audience or people who actually kind of love the game might enjoy it postscript I caught myself thinking many times during the movie and afterwards why did i chose to see it I do not even like the game,3
31 May 2016,An animated movie based on a game that isn't that bad,The Angry Birds Movie is an animated film based on the mobile app of the same name and stars Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad Danny McBride Peter Dinklage Maya Rudolph Sean Penn and Bill Hader it s about an island inhabited with happy smiling birds one of the birds named Red played by Jason Sudeikis is not happy at all in fact he is an angry bird due to this the judge sends him to an anger management class where he meets Chuck played by Josh Gad and Bomb played by Danny McBride during one of the classes a ship filled with pigs docks the island and starts showing off inventions and gadgets the birds have never seen before to distract them so they can take their eggs that they lay and eat them back at home Red Chuck and Bomb discover this and rally the birds to get angry and steal their eggs back from piggy island via giant slingshot getting to the basics are my initial thoughts on the film This movie isn t bad by any means necessary but it isn t great hence the above average rating it does have a lot of Pros and a lot of Cons Pros the animation is perfectly done the voice acting is good and i did get some chuckles here and there and the climax is amazing and it s where the movie truly shines in it s animation Cons things happen and it has no place in the story it can be unnecessarily noisy and a lot of the jokes fall flat the rendering on the animation isn t that strong and the story is all over the place Mighty Eagle is an annoying stupid clich d character that has been done to death I hate him a lot as well as a lot of the birds that give Red such a hard time too many sex jokes that doesn t really seem suitable for children and aren t even wink wink do ya get it kind of jokes More cons than pros on a very entertaining video game movie which is saying a lot your kids will probably like it but outside of that it s an average film for families,6
18 September 2016,"Angry Birds Movie is a filthy movie that masquerades as family entertainment, with risqué humor & overall lameness",As sent to my brother in law by e mail warning him to consider banning this movie for queueing as selection for his young children I just rented The Angry Birds Movie on Blu ray at Redbox and I found it to be appalling and terrible I ll explain why you should NEVER show it to your developing children It s one of the most irritating animated movies I ve had a misfortune to have seen and I did not finish watching The Lego Movie which I turned off when it was only about 20 minutes I hated that movie that grated on my nerve The one common thing Angry birds movie and Lego movie share is that it s nauseatingly nonsensical inane and frenetically paced that doesn t know when to pause for quiet reflection Another common thing both movies share is awful forced humor and what made Angry Birds worse is that it s atypically crude for a PG rating with this movie being advertised as a family movie when that should be the opposite in deceitful advertising The Angry Birds movie contain profanity and risqu humor with the former cleverly according to the idiotic producers belief disguised with double entendres such as substitute for the F word at least twice This movie doesn t know what it truly wants to be It s a bizarre and convoluted animated movie and it s simultaneously irritating headache inducing and morally offensive I can t see any point of this movie despite it being a mobile game adaptation It s a surprise that this movie despite the mobile game s enormous popularity is almost a disappointment in domestic box office gross I can attribute that tepid box office gross to the bad word of mouth that condemned the movie by the appalled parents and annoyed children who could not understand some inexplicable movie references that only the adults know for sure and they will inevitably ask with confused demeanor what does it mean Angry Birds is overall an awful movie and it s absolutely NOT appropriate for children under 10 at least It contains a prolonged scene involving the stream of urine that is unnecessary and offensive This movie by the way is so puerile in its juvenile attempt at humor including lame movie and pop culture references that it s not funny at all I never chuckled It s an endurance test And I played Angry Birds mobile game only momentarily and then left unimpressed Although I admit to buying Angry Birds gummy products in various editions at the neighborhood grocery store to cut out the characters at home As a parent striving to be good and protective I suggest instating a ban of Angry Birds movie so that your children should never see this movie until they are teenaged age at least It s too dirty for a PG rating courtesy of the creator studio and the shameless Sony distributor that emphasize vulgarity in children s entertainment that fails to even entertain They fail with this movie badly I d give it one star One of the worst movies of this year The only positive thing to say about the movie is that the CG animation look gorgeous on my Sony HDTV as almost upscaled to 4k That s all there is to this putrid piece of crap that s only a cash cow for its producers who pushes filth on the children while masquerading as family entertainment This filthy movie ought to be PG 13 MPAA is moronic with its rating decision yet again with conflict of interest favoring the big studios with the low bar on appropriating movie rating If you see the movie with your wife you will know why I hate this movie and am appalled at its risqu content Definitely not for kids either despite its marketing misnomer claiming family genre It should be next to adult anime section and 70 s R rated adult animated fare like Fritz the Cat out of 4,1
26 August 2019,Funny Kids Movie,The Pigs Arrive on Bird Island But what do they want Fun movie for kids and adults will enjoy it too though it does take a while to really get going It will help if you played the game a bit Lots of daft humour The animation and voicing is good The story needed a bit of work it s only a vehicle for the stunts and gags but could have introduced the special abilities of the birds a bit more cleverly I liked The Lake of Wiz,7
20 May 2016,"""Harmless Film""",The Angry Birds movie may have a great animation and that s it nothing else good to say This better for children than for adults of course cause it s a kid s film but out of all the animated films I saw in the past years Animated films can be smart and can be enjoyed by two demographics This film on the other hand felt like it s just for kids to enjoy The characters are well animated except for the pigs which are all of them look the same sometimes The main character Red is kind a bit annoying not like able or even lovable he is just annoying Chuck is is sometimes funny and sometimes just again annoying Bomb is the only thing I like he is not that annoying at all They tried so hard to to make their jokes work but it felt forced and overall not good at all some jokes are for adults but again it felt forced and not funny They really tried but failed Jokes are just really clich Story on the other hand is bland and seems predictable The voice acting are okay The Angry Birds is just another clich kid s film with a bland story and predictable jokes Out of all the animated film of the year this isn t as bad as Rachet and Clank and Of course Norm The North but I might say it s mediocre at best and also harmless It will be forgotten in the next few years I think Just watch The Nice Guys and leave your kids to watch this film,6
29 July 2016,Watching birds get angry is a hoot!,Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,8
28 May 2019,Not bad (for a kids' movie),I don t even remember why I watched this movie It was on TV and I suppose I wanted to see just how bad it was It actually wasn t as bad as I was expecting I mean it s based on an app It s obviously meant for kids and tweens but for a kids movie it s actually not bad I have no idea how it got 10 s certainly didn t deserve that but if you have to watch it to appease your kids or nieces nephews you re not gonna sit there wanting to pull your hair out or pray for it to end Definitely better than Spongebob or some of the other insufferable tripe that s out there,5

14 May 2016,Avian Absurdities,Angry Birds is a video game franchise created by Finnish company Rovio Entertainment It was first released in December 2009 By July 2015 the series various games in all its different formats have been downloaded over three billion times the world over It was not a big wonder that a film would eventually be made from the characters of this game Practically everyone has seen at least the original game with the five birds main bird Red yellow bird Chuck black bird Bomb white bird Matilda and triple Blues Many should be familiar with the maddening physics laced puzzle game play of launching these angry birds to hit the green pigs hiding under various structures Not too good with analyzing projectile motion I admit I was not so patient with this game The film s storyline tells of Red as a miserable hotheaded outcast with poor people skills A violent altercation with another bird caused him to be sentenced to attend Anger Management classes under Matilda There he met Chuck and Bomb as well as quiet giant maroon bird named Terence One day a ship of green pigs landed on the birds island While the other birds welcomed their unusual guests Red remained suspicious that the Pigs were up to no good Unfortunately Red s worst fears were soon confirmed and birds have to go beyond themselves to get their precious treasures back The film as a whole was better than what the trailer showed For the most part the storytelling was very entertaining The best part of the film was the climactic battle where we saw the birds in action with the giant slingshot but it was too short I felt It was too bad we only saw the green boomerang toucan bird Hal the tiny orange bird Bubbles and the cute pink bird Stella all too briefly On the other hand an inordinately long occasionally awkward time was spent with the iconic Mighty Eagle The voices come from some of the most popular comedians working in Hollywood today Jason Sudeikis was Red Danny McBride was Bomb Maya Rudolph was Matilda Bill Hader was Leonard Josh Gad whom we last heard as Olaf in Frozen was Chuck a hyperactive voice performance I really enjoyed Peter Dinklage did so well in his ironic casting the Mighty Eagle It is very surprising that the first time I have seen Sean Penn s name in a film again was as Terence Fans of the Youtube channel Smosh will be delighted that Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla have cameos here as the voices of Bubbles and Hal respectively The comedy was rather weird to describe The jokes can really be juvenile shallow and silly but there were also quite a number of adult humor some even creepy or uncomfortable references I liked the obvious parody of the Time in a Bottle scene from X Men Days of Future Past or that Grady twins reference from The Shining I liked the cheery and cheesy retro pop songs in the soundtrack from Never Gonna Give You Up to I Will Survive to accompany the most unexpected scenes I had fun watching it for sure but I cannot say I completely liked this film It was really had to put a finger on what exactly the film lacked but my kids and I all felt it while watching Looking back now I think it may have been this odd sense of humor which felt forced and flat at times Anyhow the small kids in the theater were giggling and laughing so much at the cute green pigs and wide eyed hatchlings I enjoyed hearing their delighted reactions I guess then that the film did hit their target and that is most important 6 10,6
28 April 2023,Why do some people even hate this !,This movie is amazing and it is not what i imagined when i was thinking about the movie before watching because it s BETTER than i thought They executed the story Perfectly and smoothly with this GOD TIER animation which is the BEST factor in this whole movie The character design is Really good the characters and charming and the visuals are pretty great A lot happens here and there it s just a lot of fun and it s really funny the pigs are the main laughing point here they re stupid and ignorant which makes them really stand out from the other clever birds And probably the best character is terance his design is so funny and he is so funny without even SPEAKING He is a good character but they didn t include him in a lot of scenes that he would ve been PERFECT in Overall this movie didn t deserve all that love that Some people didn t appreciate and i totally recommend this movie to anyone who is a big fan of this game,9
4 February 2017,Feathers of a bird,It s actually more than one bird Although if you know the game you do know the Eagle But let s leave him out of this for the review no pun intended And I have to admit I was surprised when I watched it It is pretty coherent it makes sense it has a story and it is funny which is way more than I expected Am I surprised this is considered for an Oscar I am a little But then again I just read a topic by someone comparing the movie to ISIS and Angela Merkel I almost lost my train of thought when I just read the subject line And I was tempted to read the thing but I reckon I have better things to do with my time Like write a review about this movie o All kidding aside this may be predictable but also a lot of fun The voice talent at hand is also spot on,8

5 December 2016,Better Than Expected,Find out why the birds are so angry When an island populated by happy flightless birds is visited by mysterious green piggies it s up to three unlikely outcasts Red Chuck and Bomb to figure out what the pigs are up to So I had fairly low expectations on this one Despite a good cast it is a movie based on a very simple video game And I thought it tended to bomb at the box office though when I double check it seems to have more than made up any losses internationally But you know what This is an alright film Not a great film Definitely not one of the best cartoons of 2016 But it has its charm especially Mighty Eagle and may be enjoyed by both children and adults Especially if you like seeing cartoon pig butts,6

14 May 2016,Kids night out movie,This movie is years late does anyone play angry birds nowadays Will even for those that were too young to catch this game do you feel old reading that line Then know that the movie doesn t require that knowledge Storyline is simple The Pigs are bad well that s it really There is some impressive CGI in this movie the Water looks gorgeous and the sky very scenic sadly the characters themselves are underwhelming considering the the two animated movies that came out before it this year kung fu panda and Zootopia It might have been more impressive if it didn t have to measure up to those two The Movie is clearly aimed at children with bright colours and simplistic plot there are a few nods to the parents though like a fifty shades of green book hidden in the pig s ship as well as a The Shinning reference later One thing I did enjoy in this movie was the music which I feel was also aimed at adults behind blue eyes never going to give you up survive but you can t credit the movie for getting the rights to them If you have kids then treat them to a fun an harmless movie the little nods in there will keep you entertained If you don t and you re above the age of 12 then skip it a solid OK movie 6 10,6

19 May 2016,Rage-fueled violence is the key to some of your problems,Set on Bird Island where flightless multi coloured birds are perennially friendly and giving out hugs for free Red Jason Sudeikis lives the life of a social outcast for harboring an overwhelming amount of anger Judge Peckinpah Keegan Michael Key then sends him to anger management classes under Matilda Maya Rudolph and there he meets yellow speedster named Chuck Josh Gad a literally explosive budgie named Bomb Danny McBride and a grunting giant maroon bird named Terence Sean Penn Along then comes a pirate ship of green pigs captained by Leonard Bill Hader who introduces them to a new technology While the other birds welcome their arrival Red grows suspicious of the pigs true nefarious intent Much like the mobile game though less addictive The Angry Birds Movie can be entirely summarized as colorful angry birds sling shotting themselves at greedy pigs The film s slim plot is brought to life by bloating the movie with Looney Tunes slapstick humor bird puns and a barrage of pop culture references While this is never a good sign of assured storytelling most of the gags are actually hits than misses Two of the funniest scenes involve Red Chuck and Bomb s discovery of the Lake of Wisdom and a mama bird regurgitating food into her children s lunch boxes talk about biological accuracy The movie is clearly aimed at children with all the bright colors and its simplistic plot yet some of its content is actually directed to adults Take for example the allusions to The Shining and Fifty Shades of Grey 80 s song choices like Rick Astley s Never Gonna Give You Up and Red responding to a bad news with Pluck my life Good luck to all parents on explaining that line By the third act the movie starts to re enact the game and we witness the angry birds in action as they whirr their way through the pig town s citadel and blowing stuff in a Rube Goldberg fashion You will be laughing hard at this point either because a these birds really do have bird brains or b reality dawns on you that the film s plot is downright nonsensical It is hard to take this movie seriously because it is so ridiculous and so unfocused haven t I mention a scene where the pigs start singing a Blake Shelton song out of nowhere On a technical note the team behind The Angry Birds Movie does an impressive job on the animation from the feathery texture of the cutesy birds to the vibrant tropical setting The voice cast willingly throw themselves into the silliness of the script Jason Sudeikis as Red shines in sarcasm Josh Gad whose voice we previously heard as Olaf in Frozen lends a hyperactive voice to Chuck Danny Mcbride steps aside from his usual foul mouthed character and portrays a dim witted voice in Bomb Peter Dinklage ironically playing the Mighty Eagle brings a comedic yet majestic voice to his character While these are welcome compensations all the sticks come crashing down when the film goes against the virtues that it is fighting for in the beginning empathy and friendship It imparts a murky message to its young viewers that rage fueled violence is a key resolution to problems not exactly a child friendly thesis as compared to those of the other two animated films earlier released this year Kung Fu Panda 3 believing in yourself and Zootopia accepting diversity The Angry Birds Movie lacks genuine inspiration telling a sagging narrative kept afloat by a steady stream of visual gags and stray media references Anger is weed growing in our garden says Matilda And just like suppressed anger I ll have to pluck this movie out of my top recommended animated features Full review here http www filmpolicereviews com reviews the angry birds movie,6
12 May 2016,"Rovio Animation nailed the quality, just the story sucked.",As the title says rovio are definitely the next big contenders in the animation studio game The quality was there and it didn t feel cheap As for the movie if your over 14 don t bother Im not saying its really bad but its exactly what you think it would be Cheesy story line predictable heroes v villains They have kept it safe to make it work And that s what it does it just works Nothing exciting or crazy to talk about it ll be a movie you can say you ve watched but wont be one you bring to a mates house or even steal one liners from Im leaving it with a 6 out of 10 but if you need 90 minutes to do shopping etc Drop your kids off keep them entertained,
30 May 2016,It sticks to the story,There isn t many surprises to what is going to happen here it sticks to the story of the pigs cheating the birds and the birds getting angry about it hence Angry Birds the movie But even though we all know what will happen it still has a very good introduction to the characters or at least Red who is the main man here but it would have been nice to get the intro to all the characters Why is Terence so big and seems grumpy on the outside but soft on the inside why does Bomb really blow up some times whats up with the crazy therapist and so on and so forth Maybe we will know more in more films but it will be hard continuing the story maybe if they made prequels explaining the birds and their behavior and personality and so on but yeah we will have to see what they figure out Location seating time Nordisk Film Taastrup Taastrup Denmark Bio 3 row 9 seat 1 2 3 5 and row 11 seat 1 3 29 05 2016 at 14 30,6
15 September 2021,Positively hilarious,As someone who spent a lot of time at school playing Angry Birds when it first came out and was popular for years including the many spin offs and sequels I found this film absolutely hilarious The colour palette is extremely vibrant and the animation very well done and it is a film that I can rely on to cheer me up whenever I need to The many references and similarities to the games are welcome but I think the general positivity vibrancy would be welcomed by those unfamiliar with the source material as well though the jokes moments are even funnier when you are familiar with the characters,10
4 August 2016,Fun Pop Culture Reference,Angry Birds was full of computer generated physical comedy Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly brought out a much different side of birds from Alfred Hitchcock Peter Dinklage s burnt out swashbuckler surprised everyone in Pete Oswald s wonderful Bird and Piggy Islands Josh Gad acted out a devious Speedy Gonzalez type of character Danny McBride delivered more of a sumo wrestler These two characters met Jason Sudeikis s portrayal of a mis understood radical in Maya Rudolph s cheerful service Keegan Michael Key and Bill Hader played out power hungry materialists though one finally fell for a Trojan horse ploy of the other Sony Pictures Imageworks positively gave the original video game s story line a Hollywood treatment,9
10 August 2016,Better than expected,Well 100 minutes of good entertainment The movie is fun has a good balance between rhythm and comedy And surprisingly could be watched even if you never played the related game I had some prejudice but the film is unexpectedly quite good The characters are really well done all of them with good personality and very well animated The story flow very easily never boring with tons of laughs The visual part of the movie is really enjoyable well balanced in term of colors and level of detail The perception of CGI is never present everything looks like very natural I Enjoyed also the soundtrack a mix of old songs and modern music,7
20 April 2017,"Weak, and just gets worse the longer it goes on",Red is a bird a flightless bird on an island of flightless birds He also has a problem anger After an incident at a child s party he is sent to anger management classes There he meets some interesting characters Was interesting for about five minutes and then quickly resorted to cheap jokes and mindless action scenes Plot is random at best and just gets worse and worse the longer it goes on I think the writers exhausted any original ideas they had by the 20 minute mark This makes you wonder who the target audience is Judging by the weakness of the humour and juvenileness of the script you d have to say really young kids But then there are some jokes and scenes aimed squarely at adults Or maybe the producers just wanted to cash in on the Angry Birds game figuring that people who enjoyed the game would watch the movie out of curiosity Doesn t matter whether the movie is any good as long as people pay good money to see it Whatever the reason this is sloppy half baked movie making and does animated movies a massive disservice,3
12 June 2016,Okay,I remember back literally years ago when I first heard of the Angry Birds movie and may have been my most anticipated movie besides the Star Wars sequels Why I honestly think Angry Birds set a record for most recent franchise to become multimedial as it came out in 2009 I don t think I have ever played the actual game You really don t need to to watch this movie This was a decent effort nothing really good or bad I will say that the animation in this film is great It s about as fluid as cartoon birds have ever been depicted It s certainly legions ahead of 90 of video game movies but it s still not quite good The plot s pretty basic with pigs coming claiming to want to be friends but are actually stealing their eggs The action scenes are pretty well done and it s about as faithful to the game as you could really expect The flaws are that the story isn t that good We ve seen this story a million times before with the outcast who desires to become a hero and redeems himself It falls into the fault of a lot of bad animated movies like toilet humor and random pop culture songs The urinating part goes on way too long That being said the voice actors are quite good in this There are actually some pretty heartwarming moments in this The story is fine it s just nothing that out of the ordinary It s not the next Zootopia but thankfully its also not the next Doogal 1 2,6
22 October 2016,Fun for the whole family! 6/10,Review I quite enjoyed this fun and joyful movie mainly because of the various characters and the way that the director introduced a lot of the concepts of the game to the big screen The witty script was a bit corny in places but it s great for a family day out and the vibrant colours and attention to detail was pretty good The film is based on Red who is sent to anger management because the head of his village Judge Peckinpah thinks that he has severe anger problems Whilst attending the anger management classes he meets Chuck Bomb and Terence who all have there own personal issues When a mysterious ship arrives at there village a green pig Leonard comes ashore and brings joy to the village but Red thinks that he has a hidden agenda so him and his new friends investigate the unknown newcomers They then find out that Leonard is no good so they try and get help from the infamous Mighty Eagle who has been in hiding for some time After spending time with Mighty Eagle they realise that he isn t going to be any help so Red uses his resources to try and save the village with his crew of misfits I liked the various references to movies and the whole saving the eggs element gave the film a meaning It wasn t in the class of a classic Pixar movie but I did like Chuck and Terence who was surprisingly voiced by Sean Penn even though he only mumbled through the whole film Its definitely one of those films that you have to watch a couple times to get all of the jokes and weird face expressions because there is so much going on at once and the pace is quite fast Anyway I thought it was a decent watch and the bonus material on the DVD was well put together Round Up It always surprises me when I see the budget for these animation movies because I wonder were all of the money goes I know that it takes many people to create the characters which can take years but the amount of money they use is mind blowing Anyway this is the first movie directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly Reilly has done the storyboards for Space Jam the Iron Giant Osmosis Jones Stuart Little 2 The Haunted Mansion Spiderman 2 The Longest Yard Open Season Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs the Smurfs and Hotel Transylvania so he has had a lot of experience in the artistic preparation of movie making Kaytis has been an animator for Pocahontas The Hunchback of Notre Dame Hercules Mulan Tarzan Fantasia The Emperor s New Groove Treasure Planet Chicken Little Meet The Robinsons Bolt Tangled Wreck It Ralph and Frozen so his impressive experience must have made a big difference to this movie I m sure that there is going to be more Angry Birds movies in the future but there is nothing in the pipeline as yet With Red now leading the village it will be good to see were they take this franchise if they decide to bring these characters back to the big screen Budget 73million Worldwide Gross 348million I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation action comedies voiced by Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad Danny McBride Maya Rudolph Bill Hader Peter Dinklage Sean Penn Keegan Michael Key and Kate McKinnon 6 10,6
19 November 2021,Sean Penn just grunts and its hilarious,I love the story animation and characters Super fun not dull moment and very feel good movie I have played the game and even when it is connected you can watch it without any precious knowledge of it,10
16 August 2016,A smartly written and produced animated film that pleases the fans . . .,Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,9
19 February 2019,It's not easy to fill the weak background,It s not easy to fill the weak background of the game into a movie The prepared passage is a bit old fashioned but the pictures are very well made,5
7 September 2016,I don't think these birds should be 'Angry'.,The Angry Birds movie is obviously based on the popular app game of the same name Due to it s enormous popularity an animated film was inevitable and here it is 1 On a good note this film stays true to it s video game origins especially with the character of Red Jason Sudeikis who is the poster bird of the game The animation is pretty impressive as every bird and the pigs are designed very well to their game counterparts Of course extra features such as wings and legs are added to characters since they appear limbless in the game The catapult and wrecking aspect is also present when the birds fight back against the pigs which I think is the most impressive sequence of the film 2 Josh Gad and Danny McBride round out the Angry Bird trio as Chuck and Bomb respectively The voice acting is good to where they match their characters perfectly However it was surprising to me to see Oscar winner Sean Penn s name in the title so I was eagerly awaiting to hear his voice and I m still waiting Apparently the large red bird Terence was voiced by Penn but he never speaks I assumed Penn would have been the Mighty Eagle but Peter Dinklage actually voiced that character This is where the film starts to dip low 3 The biggest flaw about this film is the script writing Nearly 90 of the lines these characters have are terribly unfunny or just plain bland This film relies heavily on the physical gags and antics of the characters rather than the dialogue which isn t right for any film For a comedy this just isn t that funny I barely got any genuine laughs rather than a few chuckles here and there There are plenty wasted and side characters that fill the void that generally makes the film boring when it really shouldn t I was hoping things would bounce back but it never does This film may appeal to younger audiences but it doesn t cater for broader groups on an entertaining level Angry Birds works better as a direct to video TV movie and it would be a lot more impressive on that level,4
21 May 2016,Adults who are hoping for quality animated entertainment will likely be angry too.,The characters known as Angry Birds have become practically inescapable Created by Finland s Rovio Entertainment in 2009 from just a few conceptual drawings of disagreeable flightless birds the video game idea has hatched into over a dozen different versions and spin offs often with bad bird puns in their titles which have descended upon smartphones and computers well over two billion times Rovio also adapted its Angry Birds games for numerous other gaming platforms which flew off shelves The Angry Birds have migrated to many other aspects of daily life all around the world For starters the birds porcine enemies were initially chosen as the digital targets for the slingshot launched birds because of the swine flu pandemic which was all over the news in 2009 2010 Since then the Angry Birds franchise has been doing its own influencing of society and culture practically everywhere Our flightless feathered friends inspired animated TV shows and a Nat Geo Wild series print publications that range from science books to cookbooks and a line of fruit flavored soft drinks from Finland Images of these birds have landed in advertising campaigns diverse TV show scripts and in sports venues as well as on sports equipment theme park attractions and miscellaneous products worldwide You could say that Angry Birds crap is everywhere The Angry Birds symbolism has even nested in the teachings of a Hindu organization in Brazil Angry Birds Yoga Interestingly the game that started it all has been accused of being a leaky app which has allowed American and British national intelligence organizations to siphon off user data no joke But perhaps the most disturbing of all these developments has been the arrival of The Angry Birds Movie PG 1 37 in U S and international theaters that are as far flung as a bag of feathers exploding against a brick wall in high winds Contrary to the current worldwide reach of their collective wingspans as the movie opens the birds are all living on an isolated island and they re not all that angry Well most of them aren t After upsetting the parents who hired him to entertain their little birdie at his Hatch Day Party a red bird with thick eyebrows who happens to be named Red and is voiced by SNL s Jason Sudeikis has a temper tantrum which lands him in court Judge Peckinpah Keegan Michael Key orders Red to attend an anger management class The class is taught by Matilda Maya Rudolph a hippie like recovering angry bird The other attendees are a hyperactive yellow bird named Chuck Josh Gad a large but gentle blackbird named Bomb Danny McBride who explodes when he is shocked or upset and an even larger red bird of few words who is called Terrence Sean Penn Of course Red brings his bad attitude to class and we understand why he lives alone having been ostracized by the other birds When a ship suddenly arrives at their island s shore and destroys Red s isolated seaside house making him very well you know and a green pig disembarks and says that his name is Leonard Bill Hader and he s an explorer from another island Red is suspicious of the pig s intentions but he s the only one While Leonard throws a big party for the island s inhabitants Red gets Chuck and Bomb to help him investigate Leonard s ship Even after the trio discovers dozens of other pigs hiding on the ship Red is unable to raise any alarm in his avian community Red then leads Chuck and Bomb up a mountain to find the legendary Mighty Eagle Peter Dinklage the supposed protector of the island While the guys are busy on the mountain and all the other birds are busy partying the pigs steal something very valuable to the birds and set sail for home Now willing to listen to Red the birds allow him to lead them in a rescue and recovery operation which involves a large slingshot and a lot of pent up rage And I ll leave my plot summary at that for the sake of those not familiar with the video games on which all of this is based The Angry Birds Movie is a derivative and uninspired film which will mainly but only marginally appeal to small children Written by animation veteran Jon Vitti and directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly in their directorial debuts the film stitches together different aspects of the various games along with bits of the live action films Anger Management Independence Day and any of a number of different superhero movies from the past 20 years According to Wikipedia com In a March 2011 interview Rovio s Peter Vesterbacka said you can t take an experience that works in one environment and one ecosystem and force feed it onto another He was talking about adapting Angry Birds to other gaming platforms but he might as well have been discussing adapting the franchise to the big screen The Angry Birds Movie reminds me of the disappointment I felt in watching Free Birds in 2013 There s more than enough colorful activity to keep the screen bright but the resulting film is a bit of a mess The movie does connect the dots in the plot of the video games but still feels unnecessary The voice acting is good the CG animation is state of the art there s plenty of silly slapstick to make the kiddos laugh and some adult oriented jokes and a soundtrack with songs from the 70s forward to make the adults smile but the movie is just not all that entertaining The video games are more fun and much more addictive than this film which just comes off as an occasionally amusing but unoriginal money grab It s enough to make a Movie Fan kind of well you know C,2
21 August 2016,Better than I had thought it would be,The reasons I liked this show and I am 43 My boys 13 and 9 loved it 1 I think that most older kids and teens would like this because they would get more of the humor This is not a show for under 8 years of age And if you don t get it than either you don t have a sense of humor or enough life experience to think it s funny 2 I think that this show appeals to people who get things that may on the surface seem just barely entertaining but in fact reveal something a bit deeper Reviewers who have said there s no story line were obviously not paying attention 3 It s not a Disney type cartoon 4 It reminded me of all the slap stick cartoons I loved as a kid but loved even more as a grownup Think Bugs Bunny 5 There are some references you just wouldn t get or laugh at if you hadn t been previously exposed and scarred for life Two word clue Jack Nicholson Let the scavenger hunt begin,8
13 November 2017,Hey-you-hoo!,Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,10
17 July 2016,better than expected,Red Jason Sudeikis is an angry bird alone on an island of flightless happy birds He s a birthday clown who got angry He s sentenced to anger management class by Judge Peckinpah Keegan Michael Key Matilda Maya Rudolph is teaching speedster Chuck Josh Gad explosive Bomb Danny McBride and quiet giant Terence Sean Penn A ship arrives and two pigs Leonard Bill Hader and Ross disembark Red sneaks on the ship and discovers more pigs The birds are perfectly happy with them except for Red As more pigs arrive and take over Red asks Chuck and Bomb for help to find the legendary Mighty Eagle Peter Dinklage It sounds like a stupid idea After Lego I m trying to stay open minded This one turns out to be better than expected but it s not overly imaginative First Red is a functional leading character He s angry but it isn t funny like Shrek Chuck is more or less his fast talking sidekick but they don t have enough chemistry Maybe they ll be better in the future Chuck and Bomb have the most fun together They re a goofy comedy duo The Mighty Eagle pool is probably the best The story is fine It tries to say something about anger but it s nowhere near good enough This is mostly loud and bright for the little kids They even get to launch the birds at the pig city Overall this is fine for what it s trying to do,6
21 May 2016,It's more for kids! but some older ones will appreciate it!,I saw the movie over the past weekend Was it great No But sure is at least something its great entertainment for the kids I have played the game couple of times but that was quite some time ago and i think the whole angry birds thing has lost its point so the studios decided to create a movie and make the world remember again the game somehow This movie is not as terrible as I was expecting sure it had a clich d story predicable turns of events some really missed match songs and some pretty unfunny jokes but besides that The animation is terrific they got some talented people to act in it and they managed to get the gameplay involved in a pretty clever way It s a lot better than it should be It also had some funny parts throughout but not so memorable ones i think that The Angry Birds Movie is probably better than it has the right to be because I didn t go into this movie with very high expectations but it was actually decent It s not perfect but it doesn t needs to It s not original but you have a lot of fun If you just wanna have fun or you only want a OK movie this is passable,6
22 May 2016,LOL movie for relaxing time,This is the movie that made for game s fan Kids and adult who has kid s mine That is me If you are not a person that I mentioned this movie may make you get bored and not enjoy much Angry bird s story line is not complicated it is easy predictable and also it is not creative as inside out The animation movie from SONY is still unable to compare with DreamWorks and Walt Disney whole different level However this is a good and really fun movie Every scenes is composed of colorful and awesome beautiful graphics there is many unexpectedly scenes that will make you LOL,6
3 December 2016,A few funny moments,I play the games and saw the cartoons on Netflix It picked up after the birds went to get the eggs I chuckled a few times and expected more it is Angry Birds and they have voices but it failed The cartoons are little better and i have a few favorites After seeing the cartoons and the birds just making noise the movie was a been there done that let s move on The cartoons put them in various situations while the movie made me feel like i was playing the game I would rather have noise and facial expressions than actual voices Expressions can convey a lot more I liked how they introduced Jay Jim and Jake but thought the eggs the birds have in the series should be there also,4
14 August 2016,Great movie,Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,10
14 February 2022,A masterpiece way better than it's Unnecessary sequel,I remember watching it back in 2017 2018 2019 I don t know that i remember And it s way better than The Angry Birds Movie 2 NOTE The only thing i don t like is The Mighty Eagle Pissing in the lake it was very disgusting to sit through Thank God It never showed it in my country,10
28 October 2016,Angry message,Children will find The Angry Birds Movie entertaining and even subversive enough They might even get the references to The Shining or singalong to a pop tune from 30 years ago such as Rick Astley s Never going to give you up Red Jason Sudeikis is angry and sent to anger management classes where he meets the slightly less angry Chuck Josh Gad and Bomb McBride who are all in therapy They are interrupted when a pig expedition arrives to the birds island Although welcomed by most of the birds Red is sceptical of these foreign invaders Red Chuck and Bomb look to find the island s Great Eagle to find out what the pigs are up to which seems to be a plot to steal the bird s eggs I am sure the kids will adore the anti immigrant message of the film and treat foreigners with suspicion,4
17 May 2016,A fun animated film,When Finland based Rovio Entertainment the group behind the Angry Birds videogames announced a film adaptation of its headline series it probably made sense at the time Angry Birds had become a cultural flashpoint of the mobile gaming industry and following the successful development of a cartoon show based on the rage fuelled birds their decision to take a leap into the cinematic arena seemed plausible when you consider the incredible success of titles such as The Lego Movie However since work on the film had begun the popularity of Angry Birds has declined resulting in Rovio Entertainment laying off no bird based pun intended forty percent of its employees Interestingly this venture to further illustrate the multi media potential of the Angry Bird franchise may now be saddled with the responsibility of saving it Having invested at least 80 million in producing the film and another 100 million in marketing it is by far the most expensive Finnish film ever produced and a box office bomb could lead to the capitulation of the entire company Red Jason Sudeikis is a bird with an anger issue Following yet another rage fuelled incident he is sentenced to undertake an anger management class ran by Matilda Maya Rudolph At first Red doesn t get along with the other members of the class which include the Speedy Chuck Josh Gad Self conscious Bomb Danny McBride and terrifyingly huge Terrence Sean Penn However when some pigs arrive on the Island led by Leonard Bill Hader Red believes they are up to no good and with the help of his fellow birds attempts to find out what the pigs are after Angry Birds throws a lot of jokes at you and their quality is very mixed from a frankly exhaustive amount of bird and pig based puns Seriously if you enjoy poultry based puns you will love this film to a range of visual and sight gags that some of the younger viewers won t understand and some of the older viewers won t find amusing Having said that there are plenty of jokes that do hit the mark and the frenetic pace of the film keeps you engaged with the action Sudeikis is charming enough as Red to be likable and is ably supported through the incessant energy of Gad and the surprisingly lovable Danny McBride The story is kept very simple and moves along with such speed that it never really allows any of the emotional moments the film does have time to breathe Therefore Angry Birds does not offer as much pathos as films like Zootropolis or the best work of Pixar or even The Lego Movie but is still serviceable enough as an entertaining experience Sony Pictures Imageworks have done a great job animating the film with a lush colourful atmosphere and nicely designed characters even if the world in which they inhabit seems a big rigid Overall I feel this is a pleasantly engaging movie with enough comic weight to yield a few laughs from even the staunchest objectors Though not a masterpiece or close to overcoming the better animated features of recent years it is certainly not the cringe inducing film some had expected it to be when it was first announced In fact with little true competition Angry Birds may be the best video game to film adaptation of all time though with Warcraft and Assassins Creed out later this year it may not hold the title for long For more reviews check out my site thebeestheysting wordpress com,6
29 April 2020,Angry birds,I think that because my expectations were so low going in I ended up really enjoying this movie The promotional footage and images with the bright colors and goofy character designs made me think that this movie was being targeted for really little kids but DON T BE FOOLED This is definitely aimed for the 10 and older demographic as evidenced by all the pee jokes and innuendos That being said I was delightfully surprised by the clever humor beautiful animation and insanely fun climax I must say though that this movie s greatest achievement is having one of the best voice casts I ve ever seen Jason Sudeikis is a strong center to the film and his deadpan delivery makes me upset that he is no longer attached to that Fletch reboot Bill Hader creates a Gregory Peck George C Scott like persona as the villainous Leonard Peter Dinklage almost steals the show as the a flawed icon of the birds There s also some great work being done by the likes of Maya Rudolph Kate McKinnon Keegan Michael Key and of all people Sean Penn and it s fun to hear some great TV actors like Tony Hale Danielle Brooks Ike Barinholtz and Tituss Burgess in smaller roles The highlights though are Josh Gad and Danny McBride who help create two of the most memorable sidekicks in modern film animation While watching this movie I kept comparing it to Zootopia While Zootopia had a much more original premise and all around creativity Angry Birds was stronger in terms of humor and all around enjoyment which I think comes from the simplicity of the story and characters,10
15 July 2018,Fun little movie,Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,6
1 May 2020,Movie out of game.,People who played Angry bird Game will love this movie Others will not find that much fun i believ,6
31 May 2016,Somewhere Between Harmlessly Bad and Malignantly Bad,Films based on video games have come a long way since the late Bob Hoskins first dawned blue denim overalls and plumber hat while on a quest to save the princess Unabashed video game nerds have had to contend with the ridiculously campy adaptations of the 1990 s the unbearably turgid reworkings of the 2000 s and the vacuous renditions on the 2010 s to say nothing of the atrocious low budget spazoid tinkerings of Uwe Boll I have no doubt that one day one day soon there will be a good movie based on a video game Unfortunately The Angry Birds Movie is not that movie The film centers on a small island community of birds who exist peacefully under the presumed eye of Mighty Eagle Dinklage who legend has can actually fly The only proud miscreant of the flock is Red Sudeikis who due to his latest outburst is forced into anger management class at Matilda s Rudolph angry bird sanctuary It is there Red meets fellow outcasts Chuck Gad Bomb McBride and the strong silent Terence Penn Things in the community begin to change for the worse with the arrival of King Leonard Hader and the pigs who distract the native birds with useless trinkets while plotting to steal the flocks eggs It is abundantly clear from the first half hour that the film doesn t have enough plot to actually fill it s entire hour and a half length To pad it the movie inundates the audience with a barrage of dated low brow jokes and bird pig egg based puns that halt just long enough to bask in assumed chuckles and applause like a sitcom laugh track The jokes that actually manage to land are ripped whole cloth from better movies whose writers may have been offended if the movie wasn t so inconsequential Inconsequential but still hard to digest especially when sitting in a theater full of families who seem to pay no mind as Angry Birds seems to belay a confusing message The pigs are portrayed as one dimensional easily distracted bumbling idiots whose singular aim is to steal children Meanwhile the only bird questioning their motives is the angriest bird in the village who seems less concerned about the village than with his own piece of mind What is the message here exactly It s alright to be angry It s okay to be suspicious and even hostile to outsiders What outsiders need is a common enemy they can use to be welcomed into their community As with all movies of this type throngs of un invested parents may lob a half hearted defense of The Angry Birds Movie It s just a kid s movie after all why try to analyze and criticize a movie meant for children They re just here for the pretty colors and physical humor This argument is as stale as the jokes that plague this movie Inside Out 2015 is a kid s movie The Lego Movie 2014 is a kid s movie The Little Mermaid 1989 is a kid s movie and they still manage to be emotionally complex legacy making and wildly entertaining films Perhaps presently children won t internalize messages of being true to yourself celebrating your uniqueness and aspiring for more But eventually those children will grow up and model themselves based on among other things the media they consumed Do you want your child to be more like Emmet in The Lego Movie or Red in The Angry Birds Movie I was rooting for this movie myself While video game adaptations have proved a troubled sub genre with unanimously lackluster results I still hope for one good flick before the end of the decade Unfortunately with bad jokes boring characters dubious themes and a generally condescending attitude towards its audience The Angry Birds Movie tows the line between harmlessly bad and malignantly bad,4

24 September 2016,Quite a surprise.,I didn t expect a movie to a casual cellphone game to be anywhere as entertaining as it turned out to be I liked pretty much everything about this movie Nothing is exceptional but nothing is disturbing the really nice comedic flow of the story The characters are varied and believable within the setting The dialogues felt natural enough And i haven t had a problem with the humor that some people found disgusting It s only one or two scenes on the level of naked gun it s a kids movie and kids love disgusting humor Just get over it There is still enough slightly more mature lines that made an old cynical guy like me giggle So yea it s a really fun movie Watch it with bacon eggs,8
10 May 2016,It has its moment but falls short,When this was first announced I was very skeptical but the trailers won me over So when I got the chance to go to a screening of the movie I couldn t pass I was very excited to see the film but my excitement depleted as the movie went on The film has its moments but it s bad as bad as I first thought it would be before the trailers I had a long nap before watching the movie but I still manage to get some shut eye for a little chunk of it I got bored the funniest scenes were in the trailers so if you want to see the film avoid the trailers at all cost and you might enjoy the movie a little more than I did Or go check it out high By garcwrites,4
16 September 2021,Great!,I Love angry birds The best animation in the world in my opinion is not better than this,10

31 July 2016,The Vidiot Reviews...,The Angry Birds Movie Online people are either playing with themselves or playing against themselves Fortunately this animated comedy was based on people performing the latter An irate avian Red Jason Sudeikis is incensed when a boatload of green skinned pigs land on Bird Island and introduce the flightless populace to helium Red s rage intensifies when more swine show up and all the birds eggs start disappearing Eventually Red and his equally flustered friends Sean Penn Danny McBride Josh Gad engage the pigs in warfare using weapons forged from pig tech in order to win back their missing ova With subtle odes to colonialism and nods to the indoctrination of a native species this vividly rendered kids cartoon based on the popular gaming app is surprisingly deep Nevertheless its profundity isn t enough to keep this humorless commercial from becoming tiresome Furthermore the birds victory simply comes down to avian flu being more infectious than swine flu Red Light vidiotreviews blogspot ca,4
12 July 2016,Angry Birds is an excellent work,I ve read some of the reviews from metacritic section and in one of the negative reviews actually by Roger Moore from Movie Nation magazine states that Sudeikis has virtually nothing funny to say But the fact is that the main character Red for whom the role is given to Sudeikis is really just an ANGRY BIRD Cant expect something funny from someone like that on the contrary tho the gags came from the conjunction between Red s grumpy angry mood with the situation and proved hilarious every minute The graphics and artwork is actually better than expected that even the small detail on every feather and background movement can be seen And the audio is really good the role by each of the characters works because they can do rage to cute subtle to hilarious weird voices like those of Mighty Eagle battlecry noises Overall its a great movie and deserved better rated it a 10 10 coz it received such an unexpectedly low rating which is not reasonable for a great movie like this And wanna add one more thing Critics Watch every movie with a lil less prejudice Seems you based the score on the voice actors and production companies We get that from the review you make,10
19 January 2022,Cartoon for adults,Funny cartoon but nevertheless not without meaning Beautiful graphics great music dialogues are just a waste Everything about this movie is perfect except for one thing Still vulgarity in a children s cartoon should not be so I think that it is for adults But from this he loses his beauty,10
20 August 2016,Bad reviews are Crazy People,There are so many bad reviews for this movie Most say that its good but not great For some reason i have found that if a movie isn t a blockbuster or DEEPLY DEEPLY moving then its not considered a successful movie in the eyes of critics Every movie cannot be ROOM or AVATAR This is the first review i have ever left and i had to do it I feel that a great injustice has been done here This movie is fabulous for children and adults It was great fun for the whole family It was superb I feel like these bad ratings will stop a sequel and i really hope it doesn t It is a great film and a sequel would be so cool Thanks,10
20 August 2016,Terribly movie!!!!!,I m not sure where all the good reviews are coming from because this movie was anything BUT good Actually it was horribly boring and painful to sit through and was seemingly missing that good message I read people post I ve played the Angry Bird games for years and when I heard they were making a movie off of the games I questioned what reasonable story line could they even come up with that would ever be worthy of a 90 minute movie I mean how much depth is in a game where a few different types of birds are launched at various structures from a large slingshot in attempt to destroy everything and the pigs within Well I guess I wasn t too far off in my doubting as there is no story to be found in this Hollywood masterpiece Instead what we sat through was a painstakingly weak cartoon where the entire hour and a half was full of worthless fillers and stupid plot holes And to add insult to the kid movie idea and so called good message the film was also chalked full of inappropriate scenes and sexual innuendos totally geared for adults I guess the writers apparently forgot or didn t care that there s going to be kids watching this PG rated movie along with their parents If its not for kids then try upping the rating next time and not so many parents will be caught off guard But I m sure with all the people who are seemingly satisfied with more cinema garbage illuminating the silver screen we re certain to see Angry Birds 2 come out in about six months with the odds of it being as equally good Hollywood writers and producers are no longer about making quality movies but would rather crank out volumes of worthlessness junk throw in some big name actors and captivate on all the merchandising products instead,1
3 June 2021,This comes up short of being an animated masterpiece but is worth a viewing.,Angry Birds 2016 is a movie my daughter and I caught in theatres as soon as it was released The storyline focuses on a world filled with birds and the main character being an angry outcast of sorts due to his demeanor He does have a couple friends that enjoy his company and try to brighten his day When some invaders begin to invade their homes to try and steal their eggs the angry bird might be the saving grace of his people This movie is directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly in their directorial debut and includes the voices of Jason Sudeikis We re the Millers Josh Gad Frozen Danny McBride Your Highness Peter Dinklage Game of Thrones and Sean Penn Mystic River The storyline for this isn t great but fun to watch unfold The characters are each unique and seeing them interact was entertaining The comedic content was hit or miss but there are some great scenes here and there that will cause you to crack up The water drinking scene always makes me fallout This comes up short of being an animated masterpiece but is worth a viewing I would score this a 6 6 7 10,7
21 May 2016,"The Angry Birds Movie aims all over the place, but it's jokes and story miss too often and is nowhere as addicting as the game",Have you ever met someone who has NOT downloaded Angry Birds onto their smart phone I sure haven t It shouldn t even come as a surprise as the addicting game from Finland has been installed over two billion times worldwide It s gotten a sequel several spin offs a couple of movie tie ins and even has a cartoon series What makes it s really popular are two things It s relatively simple where the simple goal is to slingshot your way into the pigs hoping to kill them all It was easier to teach my dad this then to try and explain Sonic the Hedgehog The other appeal is that the design is bright and colorful You could even call it ironic giving the dark nature of the flinging birds Just like the recent Ratchet Clank this game is giving the animated feature length format a try Unlike the latter that already had a full story to use the premise of the Angry Birds game is extremely thin it s birds versus the pigs Now unlike some that already dismissed the idea of expanding this I felt there was potential to this Not a lot but some So does The Angry Birds Movie have the right idea for a film It does but well here s the story On a tropical island full of flightless birds a grumpy bird Red played by Jason Sudekis seems to be an outcast due to his violent nature His recent outburst at a birthday party sends him to anger management as overseen by the overly happy therapist Matilda played by Maya Rudolph Some of the others in the class include the high energy filled Chuck played by Josh Gad the explosive literally Bomb played by Danny McBride and the really big Terence played by Sean Penn The four try to take in their lessons until a ship pulls in The captain of this ship is a pig A green pig Leonard played by Bill Hader who tells the birds that there are from another island that s all pigs The rest of the bird community seems pretty excited to these new visitors all except for Red who suspicious After winning them over with parties the pigs make it off with all of the eggs putting most of the expecting children in jeopardy After trying to seek the advice of the Mighty Eagle played by Peter Dinklage Red leads the birds to the pig island where they ll use a slingshot to try and beat them The Angry Birds Movie does build some characters gives them a world where this would seem likely and even a premise to use the slingshot mechanics from the game So what wrong with it Boring You can tell with the strange premise the film tries to have fun and throws a ton of jokes at you but very few of them got a laugh out of me My problem is that instead of being clever there s a lot of crass and crude jokes that are too cheap butt jokes pee jokes and even sexual jokes Along with the ironically safe humor the given story does not justify its ninety minute running time Like the rubber band of the slingshot it s stretches itself too far I even counted four unneeded musical montages A better writer might have done more along with more usage of it s comedians At it s best the animation is nice to look at The last act when it resembles the game is a lot of fun The best humor comes here too when it goes dark with the amount of destruction it does to the pigs I really wanted more of the dark stuff but nope more butt and pee jokes I ll give this four Angry Birds apps out of ten You could say that the movie aims all over the place but the jokes and story miss too much to be as addicting as the game Ill keep my finger on my smartphone rather then this movie ticket,7
2 January 2017,They stole our eggs,I would give this movie a ten out of ten simply because it reminds me of my favorite smartphone more like dumbphone game ever Angry Birds Such a simply plot such justified anger That game was revolutionary The movie made me laugh To be honest with you I watched it on Hulu as amusing background noise while my wife son and I went about our business in the house But we all watched a little bit we all laughed and we all agreed it was beyond what we expected for a smartphone game adaptation which is what this movie is Mighty mighty Eagle Rescue me Look at that The music is so catchy I started writing along,10
10 March 2017,"Average Animated Fun,",Angry Birds is a mediocre movie with an average plot and a stellar voice cast It is whimsical fun that has a lot of surprisingly funny moments terrifically delivered by its cast Jason Sudekis is stellar in the lead role delivering the character s anger with great passion He is also joined by the likes of Danny McBride Bill Hader and Josh Gad it has a stellar ensemble The film does not try very hard to be entertaining for adults I understand that it is aimed at kids but it did not have to be solely this way It could have taken a note from the likes of Toy Story and Shrek making it humorous and clever enough that it is not unbearable for adults It s plot is very typical there is really nothing other than the story It has a beginning s middle and end it has the same structure as any kids movie and nothing in between It is mindless simple fun that I will admit had me smiling at times even if there is nothing there to amaze Funny and forgettable if you are looking for a film for your kids to enjoy Angry Birds might be a delightful choice otherwise you should avoid When an island populated by birds is invaded by green pigs it s up to three birds to put a stop to this,5
15 May 2016,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,We were a huge fan of the game Angry Birds We could play it all day and never get bored Years later a movie finally decides to come out Fans of the computer game will probably admire the way that the film makers managed to crowbar a narrative into the baffling silliness of this phenomenon But if you are not a regular player the story feels like an inelegant and pointless scramble of trampolines catapults eggs and anger management classes Despite the best efforts of Jason Sudeikis the voice of the central character Red who drenches every line with a thick coating of irony this simply isn t funny enough to charm the parents of the film s intended audience impressionable and not particularly discerning children We for one did not think it was that embarking or charming to watch It had a few good scenes but that was it The characters are all annoying and so over the top that it wasn t funny It was more embarrassing And the movie was too childish that I was embarrassed to be in the theater So it s not even a family movie it s more of a kids movie While Goosebumps and The Jungle Book remake both captured the charm and wit and humour to appeal to adults this movie doesn t really succeed in that manner Take your kids to see it but don t expect an adult to enjoy it Autstic Jay 2 5 stars Autistic Nick 3 5 stars,5
27 April 2021,Characters to live,Not so sure why this is rated 6 instead of at least 8 Probably because of people who did not play the game Below is what I think 1 Characters to live I love how they had to explain everything game character how they are who they are How they got the characteristics etc 2 Production the video quality the movements the expressions the value added motions and jokes and movements are extremely out of a 3 star movie production 3 Comic the jokes where real It is was a real comic 4 Etc,10
23 August 2019,Entertaining for its purpose,Great visuals and animation make this film stand out as the colors are nice to look at The characters of the birds are likeable and their is an intrigue about the plot although it being relatively basic,7
31 May 2020,"Could be worse, could be better",People weren t expecting much from this film when it was announced and I can confirm that it is no masterpiece but it will still give you a great time The characters all had their own distinct and angry personality and it was fun to see their adventures For an adaptation of a video game a simple mobile game at that it actually incorporated the birds and the catapult very deftly and naturally into a thrilling story,6
12 February 2021,Funny movie,I thought it would be bad but I was wrong It has funny surprises along the way,7
17 July 2016,Bordering on acceptable,Today s children s movies have been mostly garbage for decades However there have been some filled with heart and really intelligent non preachy story telling I consider Jungle Book BFG big Hero 6 and Zootopia to be some examples of intelligent dramas for kids However this movie doesn t make the grade It even lacks the charm that lowbrow movies like Free Birds had The story follows red He s your typical 1 dimensional accidental hero He finds some misfits and they go on a journey together You meet the pigs 1 dimensional villains and everything gets stitched up lickety split Nobody stood out in this movie There were plenty of funny one liners but you don t care about any of the characters In some ways it s like watching a game Nice visuals nice tune scripted plot with no surprises and nothing intelligent to say Female characters are not portrayed well although the therapist had some good flaws and I respected how she lost her cool which is rare for female characters kudos to the writers for thinking outside the box of the last 20 years on that one aspect If you don t like sexism you will be peeved that the female characters have no personality and contribute nothing to the solution But as most movies suffer from the opposite problem girl power it s shaking things up and failing at doing so If the kids are desperate take them to see this If you want something more intelligent or more sincere look elsewhere,4
18 October 2020,Angry birds,Awesome movie I love it and the new one amazing hope there will be a third,10
15 May 2021,Angry Bards,Angry Bards is probably the most deeper things i have ever had in my life Sometimes i awke at around 12 PM and stare at the roof of home and think to myself Angry Bards I wish i was an Angry Bard TBH Im Sure People Who Have Watched This Film Feels The Same If I could Give This Film A score I would be happy,10
25 April 2017,"Pull back, release!!",Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,10
13 February 2020,Why make this?,Did we really need another movie based on a game The answer is NO,2
8 June 2016,The curse of the games that become movies continues.,First of all let me say the only good thing in this film stereoscopic effects Really well done I must admit The rest Pure garbage Arriving too late to show relevance because the period of the Angry Birds mania already finished this film has no originality and its characters are shallow stereotypes shallower than a saucer If you are over 5 years old or You has already seen at least 5 animations and anime in your life then you ve seen this film Starting with the very clich protagonist hero Red a boy who is rejected by his entire community wow that original thing my goodness and that is orphaned Harry Potter Naruto Luke Skywalker Bruce Wayne and plays the hero who wants to save the society that mistreats and rejects him Really Where is the logic in that No real human being read no believable character would care to help a group of individuals or a society that only mistreats you It makes no sense at all Friends of the protagonist follow him just as script convenience nothing more than that because there is no real reason for them being there It all sounds forced Not even funny this film is the comedy is full of memes we ve seen a million times and scatological jokes inappropriate for children But if the film is too dull for youth and adults and inappropriate for children too it just shows the lack of focus of this film A waste of time The curse of the games that become films continues Be careful Assassin s Creed,1
30 May 2021,A really good movie,Nothing to say except that i really liked the movie,10
2 December 2021,with anger management issues,The Lego Movie proved that you could turn a potentially cynical cash grab into something with depth humour and genuine craft The Angry Birds Movie on the other hand proves that sometimes it s easier just to make a cynical cash grab Addictive though it may be the original Angry Birds mobile app hardly screamed with cinematic potential There is no obviously compelling story bursting to escape from a cartoon bird being catapulted into a green pig Almost inevitably then the transition from phone screen to cinema screen feels retrofitted and clumsy throughout,10
25 March 2018,I guarantee all the 10/10 reviews are from trolls.,The only reason I decided to watch this movie was out of curiosity How did they make a movie out of such a simplistic phone app Luckily it was available on Netflix You can always count on Netflix to have just the greatest content Plot This movie is mostly filler There are a few poorly executed subplots in this thing Hard to tell which one is supposed to be the main one The script is very bad This movie is mainly just a collection of references and rip offs of better and more entertaining movies Like X Men and The Shining Characters They re all poorly written and annoying Most of them are morons Enough said Animation The animation isn t very good Its not terrible though There are some odd choices that were made All the trees have scales for some reason PG This movie is full of sexual innuendos There s also a lot of adult references I m not sure that this movie is appropriate for children There is a scene where a bird pees for over a minute I m not even exaggerating the bird pees for like over a minute into a lake for some reason Its very gross and unnecessary There is also an attempted suicide that s mostly glossed over Comedy This movie isn t funny I guess the idea that someone thought that this movie would be a good idea is funny and some stuff is so cringy that its funny but there aren t a lot of legitimate laughs you re likely to get Some of the set ups are so instantly stupid and nonsensical that I had to laugh The jokes themselves don t worth though This movie is dumb and not worth watching,2

6 January 2022,A Backstory to Angry Birds,This family friendly animation is great at producing a satisfying scenario of how the war between the pigs and the birds in the popular app began But it s not specifically something adults will enjoy as much as their kids because alike most kids comedies with somewhat foolish ideas there s more of the overused silliness within the childlike humour There s the unoriginal selection of tiny innuendoes silly characteristics slapstick pratfalls and did we win yet laughs throughout the movie That s the only source of comedy so it s up to you whether or not you want to see more of it Adults will still get a fair chuckle out of the voice performances especially with Josh Gad as Chuck and Peter Dinklage as the idolised Mighty Eagle But The Angry Birds Movie creates an idea of the backstory hanging behind the popular and entertaining app that anyone could love Considering it s the background there s plenty of creative and imaginative ideas and the pacing isn t horrible either If you liked this review check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews,6
16 June 2020,The Angry Birds Movie,Good Movie The animation in the movie was excellent The movie was funny The movie was not so interesting The movie bored and lagged because it deals with the same problem throughout the movie The movie had some unwanted scenes and songs Good Movie,5
10 December 2016,"As a children's movie based on a popular app, its at least passable",In this generation Hollywood has reached the point where novels comic books television shows and even video games are no longer the only subjects to big screen adaptations Hollywood has now expanded upon this range with popular smart phone apps serving as sources of inspirations and this is where first time directors Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly of Sony Animation Studios unleash the highly popular game Angry Birds in film form This game garnered strong memorability for it s addictive gameplay of launching colorful birds with a catapult and crashing into tall structures manned by green pigs but the idea of turning this popular game into animated cinematic vehicle seems highly questionable And though the results are enough to garner fair attention of elementary school kids it only rises at an entertainment level that is likely to leave parents either scratching their heads and annoyed than invested in this thin laugh fest So this film is set on an island where birds live happy and peaceful lives except for one bird in particular named Red voiced by Jason Sudeikis fosters a grumpy attitude and has often alienates himself from the community In response no one on the island has gained much of a liking for him After a horrible incident Red is admitted into an anger management where he meets yellow bird Chuck voiced by Josh Gad and an explosive black bird named Bomb voiced by Danny McBride What eventually continues as an average grows into a surprise when a fleet of green pigs captained King Mudbeard voiced by Bill Hader arrive on their island in hopes of making a home there Everything starts off fine until Red learns a secret diabolical plan to destroy the island and rob everyone of their eggs In terms of child friendly animated movies there is a significant distinction between a movie that appeals to children in the single digit ages and a movie that appeals to both children and adults of all ages The creative efforts of Sony Animation Studios here result in a movie that falls mostly in the former category it is only too bad that this film fails on the deliver on the standards of Sony Animation s previous efforts such as Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs which garnered fair family appeal This film sees a glamorous cast of actors including Jason Sudeikis Danny McBride Bill Hader Josh Gad Maya Rudolph Peter Dinklage and Sean Penn among a string of criminally underused actors and places in the voices of cute furry and not furry animals who all demonstrate fair comedic potential Nonetheless the film fosters only a handful of jokes including an absurdly long pee joke that can certainly leave the youngsters cracking up while leaving the adults spitting nothing more than quick chuckles There is definitely not enough clever humor to sustain the film above the level of passable children s comedy nor does it strike up enough substance to please audience of the older age range If you are a parent or adult the best treats this cartoon manages to sneak in is a small of range of surprisingly raunchy innuendo including one juvenile replacement of the F word that will hopefully fly over kids heads As this is indeed in a children s animated flick there is at least a good amount of charm to be handed But to extent there is nothing really special The characters mostly the main three Red Chuck and Bomb are likable to make for some cute characters for young children to crave on and the colorful computer animation done on them particularly on the fair of the animals as well as the environment is beautifully done But whether or not they reach the capacity to gain the heart of adults is quite questionable Obviously children who grew up playing the game on the iPhone iPad or any other electronic device are the primary targets for getting a kick out the characters or even the plot In terms of the film s faithfulness to the popular source material it does an okay job especially for an adaptation of game that values more gameplay over an actual storyline When adapting a game dealing with slingshooting a bird that breakable objects the lack of a cohesive story often places a severe restraint on proper story development Fortunately writer Jon Vitti manages to squeeze a little juice out of the source material by delivering a plot that doesn t reimburse much homage to the game until the final act when our characters engage in a frenetic catapult battle against the army of green pigs Complete with countless explosions and a squeak of small laughs this long action sequence is somewhat fun but does little make for the all the parts of the film that criminally fail to work The Angry Birds Movie is mediocre children s animated flick that might provide a few good laughs and fun for young kids or maybe a few teenagers But it never quite succeeds above the level of a disposable animated feature nor does it hold the quality of a classic cartoon While this movie offers a pinch of cuteness and charm but should have been more fun than this,5
1 June 2019,Angry birds,Agreeability gets you so far in life but when the chips are down it helps to lose your temper sometimes That s a pretty unexpected moral takeaway for a kids movie and it s just one surprise of many in The Angry Birds Movie a fast fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that at its zenith had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens Establishing a basic psychological motivation for the fiery disposition shared by the feathered folk of Bird Island this irreverent origin story takes an appropriately loose elastic approach to its larger narrative with frequent detours to fill in daffier details of its mad mad mad mad story world,10

15 June 2016,Perhaps the Best They Could Do Based Off the Game,I went to see this movie a couple of weeks ago since it was based off of the hit game which I have played a few times and since an animated film is fun now and again I wasn t blown away but I also didn t find it to be terrible The film is of course based off of the hit video game by the same name which you can download on your mobile phone In the game you use a slingshot to hurl birds through the air in hopes of destroying structures made of wood and stone In the structures are the faces of green pigs which is the ultimate goal to knock out along with the rest of the buildings The movie proceeds from this idea The film revolves around Red the cardinal in the game that is the main component player early on Red lives on an island of birds that cannot fly Soon we learn that the island is being invaded by a horde of green pigs with nefarious intentions That said the plot of this movie wasn t the best but given the structure of the video game and what the script writers had to work with it was perhaps the best that they could come up with Anything else wouldn t have jived with the way the game works All that said I d give this movie 6 10 stars Not great but not a complete waste Kids should love it but fair warning as there was a time or two when I felt like the adult humor was a bit pressing The phrase Pluck you stood out as a bit unnecessary,6
21 April 2019,So funny.,Watch for the hidden adult jokes Great for kids and mum dad,10

7 March 2020,"Silly funny and fun with great animation, but does't bring anything new to the genre.",Silly funny and fun with great animation the film is a real joy to watch from beginning to end It s got a good story where every scene is vibrant and filled with colour action comedy and music Plenty of jokes for adults and kids they really captured the personalities of the birds although the pigs could have done with being more memorable It doesn t really do anything new or different in the animated movie market but I enjoyed it a lot,8
11 May 2016,It Was Okay For A Kid's Film,So I am going to be straight up honest I have always loved animation films because they have always made me feel like a kid again I won t lie even Winnie the Pooh is also entertaining for me The original ones But let me tell you if you are over around nine years old just drop off whoever is younger than nine at the theater and do something else then come back and ask the kid about the film The kid will explain it exactly the way the film is First the good I liked that it has a few cool voice actor s The voices for the film is very well casted There are also very few funny moments in the film I also loved how they also stayed true to the app game and yet still at least tried to create a story out of it I also liked the King Piggie since he was at least trying to be a comedic villain Now for the bad It is a childish film A REALLY childish film I felt so embarrassed to be in that theater I was hoping in my mind I could be at least eight years old so I could feel confident to watch it but I had to hide myself from the others the whole time I mean kid s would probably get a few jokes in this but as an adult I am pretty sure you will have to ask your kid or younger brother or sister to explain it Now for my own personal opinion Like I said rather take your kid who is younger than nine to see the film and let him her tell the film to you instead You could save a lot of money When it comes out on DVD rent it on the day you feel you have watched literally every good movie you could think of I will admit it was better than Alvin and the Chipmunks 4 The Road Chip,3
27 April 2021,A decent adaptation of Angry Birds,It is not an excellent film but it is not as bad as it is said the animation is good the plot is fun and the characters are charismatic it s pretty decent,6
7 May 2018,Loved this more than I expected,I wanted to see this film since I first saw the trailer however never got around to it till it went on Netflix and found that I loved it It has comedy for both adults and children and made me laugh which was a great surprise to myself Highly recommend giving this a watch,10
25 June 2020,PURE AWFUL,With questionable jokes related to the word pluck truly unfunny moments jokes that don t really make sense and a 6 yeargap between the peak of the original game s popularity and this movie The Angry Birds Movie is truly awful and shows that Rovio will soon be bankrupt making them think that this movie is their best chance at making the Angry Birds brand profitable again,2

1 October 2016,Just not very good,I have been a fan of the Angry Birds mobile games since the beginning I didn t hear or see much about this film before release When i did hear about it it didn t really excite me my gut instinct led me to believe it was a cash in exercise I was on a long haul flight recently and saw Angry Birds on the movie list I do love a good animated movie so with 12hrs to kill I thought I would give it a go I wish I had not bothered the movie was awful So bad in fact I turned it off after about 45mins As I feared its a complete cash in exercise The first and most crucial problem is none of the characters are likable The main character specifically is awful he is just not a character with any nice traits They try to make him cheeky and wise cracking but he just comes across as a jerk The story line is not existent and feels completely forced Its all over the place and has no logic I kept asking myself what is happening here Another miss is the concept of why the birds are angry in the movie it just does not work This is a kids movie with birds in anger management It feels like Rovio said hey lets cash in on our mobile game and make a movie and shoe horn it around our game Rather than having a good story first You can feel this all the way through the movie I also thought the humour was way off its just not remotely funny What your Toy Stories and Wall es do is make a movie that kids will love but also a movie that people of all ages can enjoy because of the humour Children may very well like this movie but I cannot imagine anyone else will More recently Rovio have changed the style of their mobile games moving towards games that are about making money all about in game purchases This is really sad and shows that the dollar is king This movie is further embodiment of that ethos In my opinion they didn t start out with a good story idea they started out with the idea to make money out of a movie And they just got it all wrong Top animated movies should always have a good story endearing characters and good humour This movie has none of those traits It is not very good,2
15 July 2022,I had no expectations and was still disappointed.,Not sure what I was expecting from a movie based on a game that consists solely of slingshotting birds at pigs Unfortunately the humor was more annoying complaints than clever quips but it had its moments,5
13 July 2022,How low can society go?,This piece of garbage is based upon yes a video game which is terrible enough but this particular game had NO characters just targets think a film based upon those shoot 3 ducks win a prize games at a traveling carnival that s how banal Anyone who gives this higher than a 1 or ANYone who says something like the writers really fleshed out a plot with good characters should also be taken as being brainless This is pure garbage Here s a fact most people don t know to name money a film by must be able to be seen by the widest possible audience With your average Hollywood film you ve already got several problems to contend with the language is obvious but there s the whole localusm I don t know any other way to put it but what I mean is imagine a regular American Hollywood made film being played in Dubai or Kenya is well known that the regional differences in American culture and that in any Muslim country is rather large so you ve got to contend with this Here s the funny thing for most of the history of films people all over the world LOVED Hollywood films they loved watching the Americana of it Unfortunately as time moves forward there s more ugh diversity at the expense of education and along with it is anti American sentiment How to combat this Ender the age of garbage that s what it is the past couple of decades in which film budgets have gotten larger the stories have gone out the window replaced by films which are nothing more than filmed video games Video games ARE known throughout the world and the problems of censorship and dealing with Americana are largely gone In its place is a one and a half hour long advert There s no more thoughtful films no more narrow focus films nor adult targeted films they ve all been trashed and replaced by dreck life this There s nothing to say about such garbage other than this If anyone has given this or any other video game based film a rating higher than 1 if anyone actually finds a film such as this to be their favourite you ll know the following the person who wrote that is either a small child or am adlepated adult if you don t know what that word means you ll love this film and finally you ll also know this whereas the film was made only about a decade and a half ago and was meant humourously in such a short time it s become a frightening and very sad fact That film Mike Judge s Idiocracy wherein the future was filled with nothing but morons,
3 June 2016,"Go see X-Men instead- not horrible, but it could've been a LOT better",First of all I thought this would be a good way to pass some time and have some fun at the movies as the trailers grabbed my interest I saw this a couple days after it was released and came in with low expectations due to the mixed reviews but I left the theater rather unimpressed I felt that the movie didn t hoist my attention span enough for me to care about the movie in a lot of spots mostly because I ve seen it all done before Same goes for the humor which really disappointed me because the trailers actually a few genuine laughs out of me but in the movie I didn t laugh as much as I wanted to and the rest of the audience can be an example as evidence for my opinion they only chuckled at the occasional spot and nothing else was heard from the theater I ll admit that the animation soundtrack Ozzy man and voice over work was pretty good and there were some good giggles I got from the movie if rare but other than that I pretty much wasted my time by heading to the cinema to see this movie and I believe you shouldn t either I won t say it s an atrocity but I m still sticking with my thoughts on this However if you want to go to the theater I d recommend seeing X Men Apocalypse Trust me I had a blast watching that it has everything you would want from a movie incredible special effects gripping action sequences fantastic performances from the cast hilarious humor a nostalgic 80s soundtrack a ruthless villain and the icing on the cake an imaginative use of 3D effects Speaking of which if you do happen to decide to go and see this movie despite my warning see the 2D version the 3D added nothing to the experience with little to no depth or pop out moments,4
30 March 2020,"Won't leave you angry, but doesn't quite sore",Considering this is a video game movie I expected a lot worse It wasn t as bad as I thought it was going to be but it s not a recommendation Considering we ve had some phenomenal animated films this year like Kubo Zootopia and The Little Prince this should be ashamed to be released the same year as those That being said the plot was surprisingly good I wasn t sure how they d be able to make a plot out of the Angry Birds games but they pulled it off surprisingly well There were also a lot of great visual puns that gave me a chuckle And other than Josh Gad all the voice actors did a good job too But that s really all the good things I have to say about this film Here s the bad First of all Josh Gad I find him annoying in everything The man cannot speak without yelling everything If you have to yell to be funny you re not funny You re just desperate for attention This film also had something I hate in animated films Pop culture references that will be outdated in 2 years Sometimes pop culture reference can work There s actually a really good spoof on The Shining that made me laugh but most of them are just there to pander to the millennials Squad goals Insta ham Boy did typing those out make me cringe There s also a lot of really lowbrow bodily function humor that even Dreamworks would think is too far And I m sorry to say but the filmmakers felt the need to slip in some adult humor There were some really inappropriate joke and references that had me saying This is a KIDS movie There s actually some borderline PG 13 humor How was this only released with PG If you really want to show this to your kids I beg of you please don t Don t insult their intelligence at least have the decency to filter it on VidAngel because boy does this really need it Otherwise you may get some really uncomfortable questions from your kids My final complaint Time slows down stops while a character runs fast cliche We ve seen it before It s not funny or clever anymore Please let this gag die Overall not bad for a video game movie but that s not a phrase that should be taken as positive Grade C 6 5 10 3 5 stars,6
25 December 2016,"The Angry Birds Movie is just a mediocre adaptation of the most popular game.Except the last half and hour and good 3D,this movie has nothing new to offer.",The Angry Birds Movie 2016 Downloaded onto everyone s iPhones around 2010 Angry Birds was the definition of a time guzzling smartphone app it was beyond all human power to resist playing I compete against strangers in weekly tournaments by launching flightless birds of varying shapes hues and special combative powers via a slingshot and aiming them at snorty green pigs Well I didn t have any interest about those birds personal lives but they made a movie on this addictive game So did the movie is addictive same as its movie Plot In The Angry Birds Movie we ll finally find out why the birds are so angry The movie takes us to an island populated entirely by happy flightless birds or almost entirely In this paradise Red Jason Sudeikis a bird with a temper problem speedy Chuck Josh Gad and the volatile Bomb Danny McBride have always been outsiders who met each other in Anger Management Classes But when the island is visited by mysterious green piggies lead by Leonard Bill Hader it s up to these unlikely outcasts to figure out what the pigs are up to So how did these outcasts save entire birds from piggies Plus Points 1 Animation Animation is awesome Rovio Animations and Sony Pictures put lot of efforts to bring a bright animation which is flawless Except overly naked pigs all of the animation is good 2 3D Even it lacks a perfect depth I think this is one of the rare animated movie which has good pop out effects Especially the sling shot scenes in last half and hour is brilliant in 3d Even the beaks of the birds protrude out few times 3 Last half and hour This part is the only exciting moment for the fans of the game It has the most fun of the sling shot which is the main play in the game The birds traveling by sling shot and destroying the piggies kingdom gives us a good cinematic moment from the game with decent 3D effects Minus Points 1 Cliched Plot and Screenplay Except the last half and hour The Angry Birds Movie has nothing special It has typical plot where the lone outcast character saves the city wit his weird friends Instead of elevating the Angry Birds concept to surreal heights of insane genius the filmmakers settle for a tale bogged down by familiar themes plucked from much better films 2 Very few funny moments I did laugh out loud once few times but most of the times the dialogues and scenes are not at all funny So The Angry Birds Movie is just a mediocre adaptation of the most popular game Except the last half and hour and good 3D this movie has nothing new to offer My rating 6 10,6

21 January 2023,Flinging Fun: A Review of 'Angry Birds',I was highly skeptical about the idea of an Angry Birds movie but I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the final product Angry Birds 2016 manages to capture the spirit of the beloved mobile game while also adding its own unique touch to the story The animation is top notch with the birds and pigs rendered in a visually pleasing and playful way The voice acting is also spot on with Jason Sudeikis delivering a standout performance as Red the film s protagonist The plot while not particularly original manages to keep things interesting with plenty of action and comedic moments One of the film s greatest strengths is its ability to appeal to both children and adults The humor is clever and subtle enough to make the adults laugh while the slapstick and silly antics are sure to delight the kids The film also manages to pack in some important messages about friendship and teamwork making it a great choice for families to enjoy together The film does have its flaws however The pacing can be a bit uneven at times and the villain Leonard played by Bill Hader is not as interesting or memorable as he could have been Additionally the film s 3D animation is not as impressive as some of the other major animated films out there Overall Angry Birds 2016 is a fun and enjoyable film that manages to bring the beloved mobile game to the big screen in a way that is sure to delight fans of all ages While it may not be a masterpiece it s still a solid family friendly movie that is worth checking out,7

15 October 2019,Harmless fun for kids but adults may be bored,Rating 5 10 Harmless fun for kids with frantic action papering over thin script Adults may find their attention wavering with a loose plot and weak storyline Has bright visuals and some funny sight gags,5
31 October 2016,Rovio is milking the franchise too much,I remember playing a very addictive physics based game involving flightless birds on a slingshot darting themselves at pigs The idea was funny and addictive I played it a lot Then like other games I grew bored of it and stopped playing it Rovio the maker of the game franchise did not stop at that They kept bringing a lot of games with little tweaks here and there but never got me interested again It was out my initial love for that game I decided to watch this film The idea is simple It is based on how the game plays out The pigs steal the eggs and the birds get revenge Making it a scripted animation could not introduce anything new I was left searching for some common elements from the game There are plenty of those but nothing that stands out as a unique movie experience Superhit songs are reprised nothing new there either The overall attempt felt average or rather tad bit below average Recommended only if you are a die hard fan of the original game You can skip it otherwise,4
18 June 2022,One of my favorite movies,I really like this movie a lot After reading all the negative reviews I was expecting it to be very bad but I found it to be inmmensely enjoyable mostly due its light hearted tone I also love how the main character it s a angry little guy instead of a wimpy spineless loser with an stoic dad that doesn t understand him I m really tired of that annoying formula It was okay in Cloudy with Chance of Meatballs but it really ruined my enjoyment of movies like How to Train your Dragon And the visuals are very nice since its has its own identity instead of trying to be a second rate Pixar knock off Unlike other animated movies filled with cheesy melodrama this movie doesn t take itself way too seriously and that works in its favor The idea of art needing to be angsty to be good is honestly very limiting Sometimes it s nice to have a movie with a fun plot which makes you laugh,10
15 May 2016,Beautiful CGI does NOT make up for the poor story...,I gotta say one thing Rovio did a GREAT job animating this movie The animation is smooth and absolutely breathtaking at times Bravo Rovio I can give you a few points for this However then there s the story and then you realize what this movie is based off of Yeah it kinda sucks I won t spoil anything too big but the film is extremely boring and the plot is simply misfit bird finds other misfit birds and they team up to defeat an evil green pig who has no development and is simply evil This guy was supposed to be like Galaxar from Monsters be Aliens wants to take over something but is kind of incompetent and is supposed to be funny I admit a couple times he can be funny but overall he is very flat and after a while he drove me crazy Also they kind of released this movie late Who do you know has Angry Birds of their phones or tablets It s in the past like Bitstrips and did not deserve a movie since well the game is just bird knocking down green pigs Yeah Real depth story telling going on here However I personally think you can make a movie based off of anything I think Rovio focused too much on the and the animation instead of the story kind of like Hayao Miyazaki s Howl s Moving Castle which is a total shame It had some potential I think Rovio after this should hire better script writers and start making movies instead of games Seriously their animation is beautiful I can imagine themselves teaming up with Pixar or Dreamworks someday Also the minion pigs in this movie are obviously Despicable Me Minion wannabes Sorry Rovio you didn t hide that too well,3
14 July 2020,What was the point?,The voice cast do their utter best to make this work and you can tell the screenwriters were trying to string some kind of interesting narrative together here but alas there is virtually nothing about this film worth any amount of praise or note After the inciting incident of the pigs invading the bird island the plot falls to pieces because that is all that happens in the app it s based on There s no conclusion to the app just level after level of the same thing which is what this film feels like scene after scene of the same filler nonsense because there simply isn t anything else for the characters to do A pointless waste of time,3

22 March 2022,"Not the worst, but not the best either",There have been many video game adaptions Some good Street Fighter Assassin s Fist and Mortal Kombat there have been some bad Super Mario Bros and Street Fighter 1994 How does Angry Birds compare to these Well Angry Birds is not a terrible movie entirely But it s not the best video game adaptation either The casting of this movie is pretty spot on Josh Gad plays Chuck well Peter Dinklage somehow voices Mighty Eagle well Even Jason Sudekis does a good Red The character designs are noteworthy and the protagonists are the three most popular birds in the franchise That s good The bad stuff about it is the minor gripes I didn t like the crude humor in the film It s only because in my opinion Angry Birds is an adaptation for all ages Having a pig dance seductively while having toilet plungers on his chest like a bikini top is over the top Also that pee joke was different It wasn t funny Most of the jokes are not funny in the movie but some of them do land a good impression Angry Birds is not the worst video game adaptation But it tries more than others we got in the past and get now It s a simple fun movie to watch with your kids despite some of the humor From what I hear the second film was better than the first so I will have to check that one out when I get the chance,5

6 June 2016,Disappointing...,Not funny at all Have been playing angry birds for a quite a long time and was eagerly waiting for this movie but disappointed Maybe it will be popular among toddlers and kindergarten kids because they will laugh based on visual and not on the story line and funny moments Unlike movies like Madagascar Monsters Inc etc where the movies is great for all age groups this movie seems unable to deliver that aspect Some scenes were really predictable where they were trying hard to make a funny scene but rather turns out to be totally amateur story line Disappointed Disappointed Disappointed,3
11 April 2019,"Old CGI Animation,New Age Of Rovio.",Good songs good animation not very good designs plot like the lego movie I do not underestimate his work and spend money on the movie but the movie made Rovio restart the franchise creating games inferior to the original ones Conclusion Decent Movie Boring Modern Games,6
16 May 2016,Not much fun at all,Looking at the preview I didn t expect much but after watching the movie it confirmed what I dreaded the conversations are dry and character development is horrendous The story line is very much predictable and felt forced Even kids come along with parents in great anticipation that crowd the cinema very soon start to get bored It try to lived up to the fun cuteness and cult of the game but seriously the game is so much much more fun and enjoyable This is a forgettable movie even if anyone intend to passes time decently Sorry guys but other animation like Big Hero Six Wreck It Ralph or Jungle Book has set the standard high for animation cartoons nowadays,3
16 January 2022,Birds vs Pigs.,When bird island is visited by pigs they receive a friendly welcome Except from one bird Red who doesn t trust those green porkchops And man was he right,7
15 December 2018,The angry birds are angry (or are they).,Ok this is probably one of the best video game movies to come out in cinemas even though it s called angry birds but I didn t get angry from any of them but apart from that it s great,8
18 July 2016,Unfunny,I was very skeptical when I saw the trailers and after hearing positive things about the Angry Birds movie out of curiosity I watch the film on Putlocker I was disappointed it wasn t as good as some people said it was At some point I thought to myself was it really a good idea to make a movie about an app nobody talked about in about 4 years Now don t get me wrong I have played the app and it was fun at the time but the movie lacked all the fun of the app I found the voice acting insufferable obnoxious I was amazed at how unbelievably unfunny the film was The character designs looked horrible and looked nothing like the games The Mighty Eagle war cry reenactment scene gave me a headache The part where Mighty Eagle took a whiz in the lake dragged on for 40 seconds They tried too hard with innuendos and became really desperate The film was quite racist as they got rid of the pigs for being different to the birds Well off to see Ratchet Clank to wash that bitter taste of this awful movie out of my mouth Who s a pretty stupid film that was just not funny at all,4
28 July 2016,It was good tho,I m not a English speaker sorry for my English This movie personally I seemed very good I watch it with low expectations maybe for that reason it seemed good because my expectation was so low that it overreached but still I like it so much as well I was afraid for being a adaptation of a video game but not was that bad The story was simple there are three main characters Red which have serious problems of angry Chuck He go so fast and is hyperactive and Bomb he can blow up when he get angry they have to join in a great adventure which I don t want to reveal enjoy it I had some problems with the movie the first one was Red Like I said he had problems of angry but in the beginning of the movie he exaggerate so much he get angry for stupid reasons that make him explode or at least putting faces of angry but you can see a evolution of this character thus problems are solved Other things was the sex jokes I don t have any problem with this kind of jokes actually I do them every day but for being a children s film I think they are so obvious and exaggerated they don t use word games or things that a simple mind don t understand but not it s very obvious and understandable for anyone but if you don t have a problem with it like me so we re okay The film is 3D animated I m a huge fan of this I really love it therefore not Pixar is my favorite studio and I feel that this movie did the job I busied It made me laugh and it will be interesting watch a sequel actually in some part I laugh so hard thing I was expecting because I liked the trailer but not in this level especially one character that when he shows up I knew in the beginning that I m going to laugh or just smile On the other hand the animation was very well done the trees are incredible the characters everything was right and the artistic design was curious I personally like it it s very well done and it s beautiful to watch especially the water jeez the water is amazing The sound stuff I don t want to go deeper because I don t know much about it but at least the voice acting it feels right I feel that every voice was good and give more personality to the characters with the others sounds like sound effects and that things was good too nothing special but the sufficient for not complain about it Okay I think I said everything and we re done I was thinking that this movie will be very bad and in the first minutes was it but in the half and the end it get better this deserve a recommendation you should watch it with your family alone or with friends for my it s a good movie to watch enjoy it,6
13 May 2020,"This Is How You Do A ""Franchise"" Movie",When I think of any franchise movie I cringe Movies based on games or other properties that are only made to cash in on a name and sell more product While this isn t always a bad thing when done well lately it seems that is the ONLY formula needed for making a movie based on some franchise the Emoji Movie is a prime example It was a literal waste of time and was nothing more than a two hour advertisement to sell social media I like many others took one look at the trailer and thought who the hell wants to see an Angry Birds movie Well as I was perusing our local pawn shop s movie collection someone else must have had that same notion because among the blurays was an unopened copy for only 4 I figured for that price if it was terrible I would only be out 4 I was pleasantly surprised however Scratch that I probably would have paid full price to own this I actually had no idea that this came from Sony had I known that I probably would have at least given it more of a chance The problem is that Sony is very VERY hit or miss with their animation studio After all this is the same company that killed Popeye and gave us the Emoji Movie Granted studios like Pixar has some good and not so good movies though they re all enjoyable to watch but Sony seems to get one right and then completely fail the next Strangely enough Angry Birds was the one they got right You don t get quite the same heartfelt connection with the characters that you do with a Pixar movie but it s still there and it gets you invested and interested to know more about the characters and how the bad things affect them and their world It makes the movie much more enjoyable when it s there to tell a story not lecture you about how bad you are or try to sell you something you really don t need All of the characters are enjoyable their personalities are all based on who they are in the game but it s not pushed to the point that it gets old and often times makes for some fun humor Oh I should talk about the humor I was very surprised at a lot of the subtle adult humor they worked in While not a prude myself I wondered just who the target audience was to watch this Yes parents may often watch a movie with their kids and a lot of the jokes would probably go over their heads anyway but it really made me wonder That being said I had absolutely no problem with the humor and I believe that if they had not gone that direction the movie would have been an absolute bore Yes a lot of the bird and pig puns are tongue in cheek and cringey but it was all done in a way that you can forgive the writers for even thinking of such terrible jokes You ve laughed at terrible jokes before don t kid yourself Even if you hated the game and you don t like franchise movies at least give this one a chance you might find yourself having a good time,9
12 June 2016,not a good or entertaining movie at all,Having never played the app game it was going to be interesting to see whether The Angry Birds Movie was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed The Angry Birds Movie is not perfect but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year i e Zootropolis aka Zootopia in some places but also far worse on both counts From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema The Angry Birds Movie is the superior film of the two The other was Ratchet Clank which is not as bad as critics made out personal opinion of course and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations dubious track record but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film Getting the flaws out of the way the story in The Angry Birds Movie is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don t really go anywhere It does occasionally feel rushed too and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire This is especially true with the quite tasteless awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag that was also really quite out of place However the animation in The Angry Birds Movie is great The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant the characters are well modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over bearing and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly the script has some very funny moments is tonally balanced with very little that s inappropriate or distasteful is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling the message is a great one gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film The Angry Birds Movie s colourful characters carry the film beautifully with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting The voice acting including actors who you wouldn t expect to work as well as they did in voice acting is excellent with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage All in all surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on 7 10 Bethany Cox,2
12 February 2017,A great easy watch,Movies can be put into 2 categories thought provoking and easy watching Angry Birds The Movie definitely falls in the latter category and there is nothing wrong with that The colour slapstick laughs and cute fuzzy looking characters will appeal to the younger audiences but there are plenty of hidden gems in there for us adults too The hero of the story Red Jason Sudkis isn t as multi dimensional as the special effects but he carries the playful story The graphics are impressive and the story is as good as it can be based on the premise of a mobile app game one I confess to getting stuck on level 16 of the original But lets be honest you aren t going to be watching a movie about a war of flightless birds and green pigs for its twisting narrative An easy watch for the family and great for a Sunday morning although you will never look at crystal clear water the same again,8

20 May 2022,A great accomplishment for a game with no storyline or script,To understand my 8 rating you must first and foremost look at this from a game perspective As an adult I m willing to admit that I m guilty of downloading and playing the original game in my spare time The game had no real storyline no character development and no explanation as to what was really going on and why this world existed as it did The creators of this film had the tremendous task of not only bringing a 2D game into the world of 3D cinema they had to create names relationships and a backstory with enough depth that you stay invested till the end Surprisingly they managed to accomplish all of this and to a degree that I enjoyed it better than some other computer generated films that had far more to work with Bringing the characters to life was very well done and you could tell they really thought out the relationship between each of the birds in the game The story not only made sense it really complimented and respected the gameplay which is a task that many other game based movies have failed miserably to do It s a non stop ride of jokes some modern some traditional Some child like some adult Although overdone it allows you to watch it again and again and pick up on things you may have missed previous times Considering what the creators of this film had to work with this was a great success,8

14 August 2018,Fun and Enjoyable,The movie keeps you entertained with its humour and will be enjoyable for kids,8
12 June 2016,NOT for kids!,I took my 10 year old little brother to see this movie in theaters and we walked out an hour into it There is MAJOR innuendo sexual jokes and references and some serious moral issues within this movie Most of this passed over the head of my little brother but I can t BELIEVE this movie is rated PG There were multiple sexual jokes made throughout the movie that weren t just borderline they were crude and explicit The characters actions were also extremely suggestive with one demonstrating the Downward Facing Dog on screen of a kids movie Also each of the characters are dealing with some form of anger management problems and the movie encourages that All in all I was appalled with the amount of sexual innuendo and explicit content of this movie I would suggest NOT taking your children to go see it,1
20 May 2016,Satisfying but alas not more.,Angry Birds is the animated adaption of the same titled mobile game Whenever a screen adaptation of any sort is due I m always fairly agog actually Of course there is much more content in books or video games to effectively adapt from than in mobile phone games which is why I ve been somewhat skeptical at the beginning How do you create a substantial movie experience out of a one dimensional game but also remain faithful to it s source material By all means Angry Birds managed to do that in my opinion Angry Birds introduces all the birds known to us charmingly extended with characteristics matching the particular bird Main bird is Red a who would have thought red bird with striking black bushy eyebrows and an aggression problem Along with other angry birds Red attends a support group to help him with his short temper On top of that the birds are being visited by pigs who much to the dismay of Red want to settle down on their beloved island Since all residents seem to be blinded by their generosity it s up to Red and his friends Bomber and Chuck to chase the pigs off of their island Of course it s not that simple Especially if you are a bird that can t fly Angry Birds is charming but sadly not charming enough to cope over the things that I disliked It s humorous without doubt and offers some smart puns but overall it simply tries too hard in order to be completely mesmerizing The actual game is neatly and in my opinion successfully built into the movie Despite that the story however limps in some places But not to be to negative I would say that Sony can be proud of their game adaptation Satisfying movies based on games are unfortunately too rare Angry Birds offers primarily entertainment and humor for children which may be dull for adults despite one or another good joke Plainly simple amusement with no deeper meaning The kid in my theater loved it,

13 February 2017,The Angry Birds Movie Review,Me and my mom really enjoy the movie and it s very funny as we play Angry Birds game ourselves and its kinda almost exactly like the game as Terence breaks the slingshot hopefully he knows how to use it in the next sequel Can t wait to see the next sequel and I have full of ideas but it s difficult for me to show them my ideas for the movie I hope I can see Silver in the next movie and how she deflected to the birds and was raised by pigs Will Red finally get a love interest I will think Silver can be voiced by a comedian as she has a very funny sense of humor Hope there will be improvements for the film series and make it more addicting like the games Maybe Red should have a love triangle I m crazy about love,8
15 May 2016,The Angry Birds Movie attempts to capture the magic and excitement of the game. It's just too bad that you have to drudge through a full hour of pee and fart jokes to find it.,Angry Birds The Movie Many people might not realize this but the mobile game did have a plot Pigs invade the lives of the angry birds take their eggs then the birds have to destroy the pigs homes in order to get their precious eggs back And as thin as that plot already is the movie was somehow able to stretch it to an hour and a half They just had to fill it with unnecessary action unfunny slapstick comedy and fart jokes The Good The characters were each unique and interesting The voice actors even did a decent job portraying the different characters I mean they got voice talent from Jason Sudeikis Josh Gad Danny McBride and even Peter Dinklage Man For the dialog they were given it was acted well It s just sad that almost every joke falls flat or ends in a character laughing When are studios going to learn that just because a character laughs at a joke doesn t mean it s funny The animation was also pretty good They were able to take the characters from the game and put them on the screen in a visually appealing way It s just too bad that when they finally get to the destroying part the movie is almost over The Ehh I can t tell you how much music there was And I don t mean film score I mean licensed music They had hip hop rock country disco I think the covered every single genre With so much music it felt more like a music video than an attempt at storytelling The Ugh ly It was so slow Now don t get me wrong there are things happening nearly every second if you include fart jokes bright lights and zany characters But the plot takes forever for anything to happen and even when it does there is almost no point for it to happen The only good part of the movie are the last 30 minutes Everything leading up to the is boring drawn out and almost completely pointless Conclusion Now I understand that this movie is for kids and that is probably why I didn t like it My theater was filled with kids that were laughing and engaged the entire time That is why minions did so well last year families with kids kept going to the theater This movie will probably follow the same path Large families with children will continually attend and it will probably enjoy a very nice run in the theaters So that being said I m going to enact a dual recommendation If you have kids that are between 4 and 10 this movie is a definite wait for redbox but if you have older children then I d say don t bother Visit Unpopped Review for more reviews from a movie lover not a movie critic,3

29 November 2016,Interesting surprise. Worth a watch for a good giggle.,I went to this one with really really low expectation Yes I played some of the games and yes it kept me busy and somehow amused for a few hours I expected an easy although late cash in on the angry birds wave since that s what the games made me expect Well I have to admit from the very first minutes I was astonished to see that they had managed to turn this rather uninteresting story and game to a minimum frame that supported an honest and good story and well put characters It even made me giggle and laugh a few times I was never really bored at all If you re familiar with the games you ll recognize the various type of birds along with their special abilities which have been turned into a viable part of their characters and the storytelling There s no abuse on that side on the contrary The story itself is in line with the games but much more detailed not that it would be hard to achieve but it s presented in a way that makes sense and would certainly be entertaining for anyone even those who don t know anything about that universe I couldn t find anything really bad to this movie The voice acting is on par the animation the story the characters everything is worth any of the animated blockbusters Their only default really is the reused smartphone game franchise that doesn t make you think this might be worth it But it is,7

31 May 2019,Great Kids Movie,This movie needs no introduction to the players of the very famous mobile game Angry Birds Out of the big rise of the original Angry Birds game franchise they thought that making a movie out of a game would be fine it turned out excellent Very emotional and humorous the voice acting of the birds is great and the animations are overall pretty nice but a lot of it lacks The story from the beginning to the end its very emotional as i said before The jokes are very funny and used at the perfect time Movie well written made me cry at the end Excellent Voice Actors Excellent Story Nice Animations Final Score 9 3,9

12 May 2016,Too late,This film was delayed more than five years Could have been a sensation if he offered five years ago is happening But very bad An hour and a half of my life will not return It can be fun for children Lengthy scenario Story weak Beginning the film which is planning the second part But I would feel sad for those who will be forced to watch it with their children The director of marginalizing many prominent figures Some key figures and did not involve Finally It was not fun was not funny I was hoping the film talks about the biggest Mobile Games to be a wonderful story But what s just a name from under the names of the films that will be forgotten by history,4

15 May 2016,Not worth my time and money,First time I get to post a review here and I did it just because of the need to balance the number of highly positive reviews I ve read of this film I deeply enjoy good animation movies like Inside Out Zootopia Kung Fu Panda 1 2 enjoyed the third but not as much as the previous two and most of Pixar movies I m a big fan of the game and my 8 year old kids are too so after reading a few reviews even though I was never excited about the trailers I decided to give it a try with an open mind and low expectations My opinion is that I could have waited for it to be released on video It s a very linear story where you have a character being isolated and bullied for being angry and ends up being a hero Voice acting was good but the jokes are very few in my opinion The whole audience laughed just once during the whole movie and it had more kids than parents some of those like myself fans of the game I don t mind the movie being late after the game is not the latest trend anymore as long as it s a mildly entertaining story In that sense I enjoyed even more Minions and I didn t think it was very good but entertaining enough I had to take my kid a couple of times to the restroom during the movie and I didn t mind at all for him to take his time and we even passed to buy some more candy I didn t feel I missed anything important at all of the story when we returned I asked them after we were out if they liked the movie and their answer was so so If you re curious rent it or wait for it on Netflix as low your expectations you may have the movie is even lower than that I should have known better to trust all those extremely positive reviews and follow my own intuition on this one Judge by yourself by all means but you have been warned,4
26 May 2016,"Watch the Trailer, Ditch the Movie",The gags in the trailer were on par with the best Pixar movies and with names like Maya Rudolph Jason Sudeikis Bill Hader Peter Dinklage Sean Penn Keegan Michael Key and Kate McKinnon my wife and I were sure this was going be a laugh riot Wrong The only thing on par with Pixar was the animation The bulk of the gags were weak and often clich Most of the content especially in the first third of the movie was so adult oriented e g political psychological struggles that the children in the theater quickly lost interest It wasn t until the birds began to battle with the pigs not a spoiler for anyone who knows the game that the children settled down There was mild entertainment value in the avian sociopolitical struggles but it was all so hackneyed and humorously flat it elicited a train of yawns from my wife and I I m certainly glad we didn t pay the luxury theater price Captain America was playing we should have seen that instead BTW I m an avid Angry Birds player but not my wife and we both walked away from the movie shaking our heads and wishing we hadn t wasted the time Hopefully the new Disney movie Alice Through The Looking Glass is better,3
5 November 2019,Much better than I expected,I honestly thought that I was gonna hate this movie for several reasons First off a friend of mine from Malaysia made fun of the designs of the characters because they did not seem to look like the actual game I was a bit frustrated but this wasn t really an issue in the end Secondly I assumed the movie would suck because of the bad reviews For example people often complained about the jokes in this movie so I tried avoiding it altogether until my mom decided to rent this film from Redbox This film ended up being a lot funnier than I expected The cast being from Saturday Night Live made this movie enjoyable especially Maya Rudolph s character Definitely would recommend,8
10 June 2016,Went In With Low Expectations,I watched this film with low expectations not expecting a lot because it is a film that was made due to the popularity of the app Basically I expected to watch an animated train wreck but it wasn t actually that bad of a film and I actually enjoyed it The two main problems I had was a they spent nearly an hour building up the conflict that everyone who watched the trailer or knew about Angry Birds in general knew was going to happen I just found that they could have condensed it a little bit more than they did and b almost all of their best jokes were used in the trailer This is a film that I think is better enjoyed if you forget about the trailer and just watch it Also it is a film that is incredibly typical for animated movies so it is a great film if you want to watch something playful that doesn t take a lot of energy to watch or require a lot of thought,

4 July 2022,A waste of my time,This movie is bad it is not good it is full of lame kid humour and is a cash grab on the games it is based on It could have been really good but it is boring and dumb do not watch it unless you want to in an ironic way as a joke,1
28 May 2016,inappropriate for young children,It s a shame that parents are bombarded with marketing for movies like this obviously geared towards young kids Riding on the coat tails of a very popular video game FOR KIDS This movie was not appropriate for young kids The look of the movie is very appealing the message of the movie is appropriate even how to deal with anger was good However the waving of cartoon butts dominating the Big Screen even slapping butts at one point was very disappointing The pigs wear chaps at one point again with the butts There s so many near cusses and potty humor The hero stands and pees with the stream going directly down the center of the screen for a full 2 3 minutes it seems These are not things I d want my young kids duplicating or even thinking was okay Thankfully my kids are older 11 16 and we were looking for something silly to fill some time If I were a parent of kids 3 7 I would not take them to see this movie Unless you want your kids to go around slapping their rear ends saying OHMY GAAA and Shell yes,2

8 March 2017,...Go and watch the movie with your kids...,For every animation movie the main hero is always the story line no doubt about it in this aspect Angry Bird is obviously not in the same standard with Wall e or Up However one have to remember the amount of restriction the directional team faced while making this movie the main plot has to be same like the famous game and that is too simple for a movie Considering these limitations Angry Bird is a very good movie although the base story is known no one will get bored while seeing it as the peripheral story making is nice animation is great and the characters are very lively You have kids go with them and watch the movie you will have a great evening,8
8 February 2021,Mindnumbingly bad,I could feel the braincells seeping away as I watched this movie Didn t make it far in Ridiculously saturated colors that give you a headache because they need to keep kids attention I guess Boring plot terrible jokes and terrible characters My life is worse for watching even a few seconds of this heap of garbage,2
