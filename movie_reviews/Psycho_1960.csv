5 September 2001,It's the Little Things,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

25 March 2017,Always holds me from beginning to end...,"...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.

This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises.

The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns.

Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the ""protagonist"" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search.

The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.

This film is mentioned in the documentary ""Moguls and Movie Stars"" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem.

Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as ""man"" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think.",10
10 August 2004,Movie At The Crossroads Of Time,"What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.

Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.

You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.

Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.

He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.

If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.

It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.

Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.

Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",10
19 May 2017,Anthony's Norman,"Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins.",10
23 November 2007,Hitchcock and Herrmann,"Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car...",10
9 December 2009,"A film that you see once, and never forget...","I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, and have really liked all of the movies of his I have seen so far. My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.

Psycho is a film that you see once and never forget, and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.

The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.

Other pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all, a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox",10
16 November 2002,One of the greatest horror/suspense films ever!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects.

15 July 2023,A Hitchcock Masterpiece.,"Marion Crane steals $40,000 from her employer, running away from suspicions and her own guilt, she checks into The Bates Motel, a quiet, out of the way establishment, run by Norman Bates.

Oh boy, this film is quite something. Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense, but he proves he could do horror to, Psycho is the perfect fusion of Horror and Suspense.

What audiences in 1960 must have thought when they say down to watch this for the first time, when you think what had come before, this film truly was a game changer.

Pacing is sensational, it doesn't hold up for a second, the suspense element is tremendous, first time viewers are in for several shocks, when the big moments come, they are hammered home.

There are several sensational scenes, but that shower sequence, that rates as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.

Anthony Perkins delivers a performance which is nothing short of remarkable, he's so soft and gentle initially, but the switch up, is incredible. Why he wasn't Oscar nominated is beyond me.

The music, as big a character as Norman Bates himself, even on the opening sequences it's powerful and alarming, but the score that accompanies the killings, talk about hairs standing up on the back of the neck.

One of my top ten greatest film of all time.

26 June 2007,Hithcock masterpiece in his most accomplished and perfect movie,"This famous film with known story tells about Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) , she works in a Phoenix (Arizona) office, when his employer trusts her some money . Seeing the opportunity to take the cash and beginning a new life along with her fiancé Sam (John Gavin) . Larcenous Marion leaves Phoenix and heads with her car towards California where her lover with debts is owner a store . When is caught in a storm and pursued by a policeman , she leaves the highway and enters Bates hotel . The hotel with twelve rooms (and 12 showers) is managed by a strange young (Anthony Perkins) who seems to be submitted by his overbearing mother , she's living at a creaky mansion nearly hotel. Then, rare things start to happen . Later on , a detective named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) , her sister (Vera Miles) and Sam (John Gavin) are looking for Marion , asking for help a stubborn sheriff (John McIntire).

¨Psycho¨ was not only Hitchcock's biggest successful movie , but was a phenomenon in its own right . The picture is a magnum opus in the terror genre and its immediate impact and its future influence was enormous and cannot be over emphasised . It's the quinta-essential shocker that created an authentic sub-genre about psycho-killers and continuing until nowadays . The shower image is one of the most studied , copied and analysed sequences in cinema history and has obtained a notoriety what exceeds of the movie itself . Terrific performance by Anthony Perkins in an immortal role as Norman Bates and sensational Janet Leigh with Oscar nomination included that was the only one in her long career. Inventive and superbly constructed plot , filled with delicious black humor by writer Joseph Stefano based on Robert Bloch's novel. The highlight of the film is , of course , the shower scene , it was made with 70 cameras to shot the 45 seconds of footage and the creepy sound effects were realized by stabbing a knife into a melon . Magnificent credit titles by Saul Bass , he's usual on Hitchcock films .

Excellent black and white cinematography by cameraman John Russell , as Hitch thought it would be very gory in colour . Bernard Herrmann's legendary musical score copied and endlessly imitated , aids to create a thrilling atmosphere . Film is directed with exquisite taste and intelligence by master Hitchcock who makes an impeccable control of every scene and maneuvers your emotions , infusing with a deliciously macabre wit , it makes ¨Psycho¨ far superior to the several movies what tried duplicate , or imitate it ; these are the following ones : ¨Psycho II¨ (1983) by Richard Franklin , ¨Psycho III¨ (1986) by Anthony Perkins himself and for cable television : ¨Psycho IV¨ (1990) by Mick Garris. Hitchcock's Psycho belongs to his best period in the 5os and 60s when he produced his finest works , perfecting the art of suspense in a series of masterpieces : ¨Dial M¨, ¨Rear window¨, ¨Vertigo¨, ¨North by Nortwest¨, ¨Birds¨ and specially ¨Psycho¨ , all of them are still studied and copied today . Rating : Indispensable and essential classic movie.",8
12 September 2000,Perkins Is Remarkable,"Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits. Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath. One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.

Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling. He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).

Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre.",9
19 January 2000,Hitchcock did it all in this one.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
5 October 2001,Tight and Terrifying,"When Hitchcock tells a tale, he engages the mind of the audience. We don't need to see knives tearing into flesh, people being strangled on the screen, or gunshots ripping through a brain. And still, when we are finished, we are more uncomfortable than had we watched the actual murder. In Psycho, it's all about vulnerability. Janet Leigh is in a state of great agitation and needs to trust someone. Unfortunately it is the master taxidermist, Anthony Perkins. His Norman Bates, with his nervous tics, his analytical surmises, his understatement, are master-pieces of madness. This film is what every student should see. It is montage; it is tautness; it is the best kind of storytelling.

The things which were still with me a month after seeing this for the first time were as follows:

1. The house. That ominous house, peering down, Poe-like from the hill above the motel. How can architecture better capture threat.

2. The scene with the patrolman.

3. The conversation Norman when Marion first stops at the motel.

4. The shower scene. I can still hear the theramin (used again at the end), and the blood flowing down the shower drain.

5. The killing of Martin Balsam on the stairs (he also used this perspective in Vertigo and Topaz).

6. The ""conversations"" with Mother.

7. The naked light bulb swinging as the rocker turns around and Norman coming into the basement.

What a great director. He saw everything and knew how to fill every minute with suspense. A truly masterly film.",10
25 November 2000,This is what good movies are all about.,"This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.

I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.

The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created.

Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone.

Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever.

The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.

Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie.

I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see.",10
1 October 1999,Perkins Irreplaceable?,"Hitchcock was very fortunate to have cast the young Anthony Perkins in the leading role. At the time there were some other young aspiring actors who might have qualified for the part, namely: Michael J. Pollard; Jack Nicholson; Bruce Dern, Dean Stockwell, Victor Buono and Dennis Hopper. However, it's hard for me to imagine anyone other than Perkins playing Norman Bates with complete authenticity, it's seems the role was simply made for him and only him. Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in ""Easy Rider""? Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks. Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in ""Magic"". I think he just might have pulled off a convincing Norman, but don't believe he was available back then. Oh well, so much for speculation...Perkins did a great job.",10
28 July 2014,Hitch's masterwork,"PSYCHO truly is an excellent film, a movie which, along with the same year's PEEPING TOM, managed to kick start a new genre of psychological thrillers which continues to this day. It's perfectly made, with an excellent story (thanks to the reliable schlockmeister Robert Bloch), a great script adaptation, and assured direction from Hitchcock.

It's hard to know what stands out here the most: the brooding cinematography, in which features such as the Bates Motel become characters in their own right, or Anthony Perkins's most famous role. Perkins encapsulates Bates perfectly, making him a bogeyman far more frightening than the OTT fantasy creations of a Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees.

Watching it today, it's tough to imagine sitting through it without knowing the various twists beforehand, but they must have been mind-blowing to newcomers. And one of the things I like best is that the film is already great, and thrilling, even before the action shifts to the Bates Motel. Add in a great Martin Balsam performance and you have one of the greatest masterworks of 20th century cinema, in my humble opinion.",10
11 December 2018,Chills! Thrilling to the end!,"I have never seen a movie that gave me this type of chills. VERY recommendable Horror/Mystery/Thriller!

This movie is so far more than the one bathroom scene everybody knows.

Watch it, you won't be disappointed!

27 July 2009,The Perkins Factor,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",10
13 June 2004,It was a dark and stormy night...,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power.

1 November 2005,Hitchcock at his scariest,"""Psycho"", the Hitchcock masterpiece of 1960, is still a scary ride. TCM presented it on Halloween night, which was an appropriate way to add to all the horror being shown on television.

As the film opens, we are treated to Saul Bass' titles that herald some of what one is expecting will come in the film. Then, one hears the magnificent opening bars of Bernard Herrmann's music score and one realizes this is not an ordinary movie. The crisp black and white cinematography by John Russell, as well as the intelligent editing by George Tomasini, surpass any doubt this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Of course, the film owes a debt to Joseph Stefano who adapted the Robert Bloch novel, in which the movie is based, with great flair.

""Psycho"" works because of the wonderful cast assembled for the movie. Anthony Perkins was an actor who could play anything. His range was enormous, as he shows in the film. His Norman Bates shows a man that appears to be in complete control of himself. We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.

Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done. Alas, she was not going to make good on her resolve.

The supporting cast is also interesting. Martin Balsam plays the private detective well. He is instrumental in cracking Norman's confidence, but of course, it comes with a high price he must pay for trying to shake the sick man. Vera Miles and John Gavin are seen as Marion's sister and boyfriend.

""Psycho"" will remain an exercise in horror by a man who knew how to scare us, Alfred Hitchcock!",10
31 July 2001,Two Words: Hitchcock's Best (...and you know that's no small feat!),"Yes, everything you've heard is true. The score is a part of pop culture. The domestic conflict is well-known. But nothing shocks like the experience itself.

If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor. Stop reading thse comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it.

""Psycho"" is easily the best horror-thriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) but not really.

""Psycho"" has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.

Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). ""Psycho"" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.

Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.

One more thing...

Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot ""remake."" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.

I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.

19 April 2000,One of the best movies ever made!,"**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**

This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!

Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!

His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
19 April 2014,Masterpiece,"A masterpiece. The ultimate thriller, and the movie that created the template for slasher-horror movies.

Solid plot, but the genius behind this is Alfred Hitchcock's direction. Hitchcock builds the tension and constantly keeps you on your toes. His use of camera angles is superb. This, all while keeping the movie moving along at a brisk pace. At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down.

Hitchcock is aided by some excellent performances. Anthony Perkins is calculating menace personified as Norman Bates. Janet Leigh shines and deserved her Oscar nomination.

Truly a classic, and one of the greatest movies of all time.

18 October 2006,Cleaning Up After Mom,"During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.

Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter, he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.

But for better or worse, Norman Bates became his career role and it's what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcock's direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.

Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them.

Simple enough, but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after you've seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leigh's legendary shower stabbing, but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.

Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things, the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.

It was repetitious for him, but a treat for fans.",9
30 August 1999,Hitchcock makes a masterpiece,"I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock. I have seen all of his movies, and think all of them are excellent. This one, however, is at the top of the food chain. Psycho is brilliant. Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was superb. Especially Anthony Perkins playing the role of Norman Bates. He always talked so fast, like he was nervous and anxious all the time. When he talked to Marion Crane about his mother, it gave me chills down my spine. ""She just...she just goes a little mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes."" At that era, I don't think a better person could have delivered that line than Anthony Perkins. What makes this movie so great is its originality. Sure, there have been lots of films about ""psychos,"" but this is pretty much the first one. The script was excellent, the acting was excellent, the direction was excellent, the cinematography was excellent, the music was excellent, the scenery was incredible, especially that dark old house where ""Mother"" lived. I could just go on and on about what a great movie this is. My grade: A+

29 November 2013,Hitchcock the master salesman,"Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40k from work, and runs away. In a stormy night, she stops at the isolated Bates Motel where she meets creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).

This one has Alfred Hitchcock as the master salesman. It's the biggest show in show business, and he's the master of ceremony. He pulls out all the stops like the secrecy and the refusal of entry to late arrivals. It helps to have the most iconic movie scene of all times.

Janet Leigh isn't just a damsel in distress or a shrinking violet. She is a woman with a dark side. The fact that she's an A-list star used to mean that she'll last until the end of the movie. When the super creepy Anthony Perkins joins her, it was set up for a prolong creepfest. Then comes the most well made important scene in history. The second half does have a little struggle to reclimb that peak, and I didn't like all the pontificating at the end. But those are tiny problems in a great movie.",9
23 September 2015,One of the Greatest Ever Made,"Psycho (1960)

**** (out of 4)

There's really no point in giving a synopsis for this film. If you don't already know what this movie is about then you really need to stop reading this right now and go watch the movie. I've seen this movie dozens of times over the years from VHS to DVD to Blu- ray and I've seen it at least five times on the big screen and for my money this is Alfredy Hitchcock's greatest film and one of the greatest ever made. I know VERTIGO, a brilliant movie, gets all the love and respect but for my money this here is his greatest film.

Where do you start with a movie like this? Everyone knows that the budget was slashed on the director and it certainly helped the film because had this been in color or had it been lavished with a big budget then it just wouldn't have the same feel. The movie has some of the most historic moments in film history that everyone knows about. These moments are of course the shower sequence as well as the ending. Both certainly deserve to be mentioned whenever you discuss brilliant scenes but for my money the greatest sequence in the movie is what happens before the shower sequence and it's the discussion between Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) as they discuss what is basically holding them back.

The performances between the two actors are just so flawless and this scene is so important because it tells us everything we need to know going into the second half of the movie, which is pretty much after the shower scene. The first portion of the movie we're worried and caring about the Crane character but we get the shock of what happens and then our sympathy immediately turns to Norman and him helping his mother. The way Hitchcock pulls this off is rather remarkable but the shocks keep happening with one terrific twist after another leading up to the ending.

What's always amazed me about this movie is how your initial viewing is nothing but pure shocks and gasps but then on repeat viewings, even when you know all the secrets, you can enjoy it just as much because you can then enjoy the film by watching a master handle the material. You can watch for the clues and see all the winks that Hitchcock is giving the viewer. No matter how many times I watch this film I can simply sit back and enjoy it on so many levels. It's a movie where you brain knows what's going on but the film is just so great that you can enjoy everything and wish that the character's fate changes somehow.

Everything from the performances to the score to the cinematography are flawless. This is without question one of the most impressive movies ever made. It's certainly a ground-breaking picture that has its legendary director at the top of his game. PSYCHO has been copied countless times over the past fifty-five years but nothing has come close to its impact.",
4 November 2000,"A classic. Hitchcock's greatest film. Everything is perfectly done and the film has the most famous scene in movie history you know the scene ""The Shower Scene"".","Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho has it all to start with romance, embezzlement, disappearance, secrets, voyeurism, a dead corpse, a split personality of a man who thinks from time to time he's his dead mother and of course death in the most famous scene of all time the scene of Janet Leigh getting stabbed to death in the shower. The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own. After 40 years and beyond we all still have the right to go a little mad.",9
1 June 2011,I Didn't Think It Lived Up To Its Reputation,"""Psycho"" has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical ""Hitckcock-ian"" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.

First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were ""horrific"" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.

What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.

One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it. (6/10)",6
24 September 2000,Check in. Relax. Take a shower...,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
27 June 2009,I guess it's never too late to thrown in your own love and admiration for a classic film...,"I have to admit that I have a terrible habit of getting around to watching classic movies when it's really late in the game. I guess my excuse is that I'm only 23, and most of the so-called ""classic"" movies of the 20th century were made well before I was even born. I'm ashamed to say that I fell in love with both ""Jaws"" (1975) and ""Halloween"" (1978) just last year; this year, just about a half-hour ago, I had the great pleasure to see Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense-thriller ""Psycho.""

A lot has already been said about this film, so I won't comment too much on what it's actually about, and instead I'll only comment on significance and my reactions to it. ""Psycho"" has a plot based heavily in reality: adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, the book and film were loosely based on the crimes of real-life Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. ""Psycho"" finds its story revolving around Marion Crane (the late Janet Leigh), a lowly Phoenix, Arizona, secretary who embezzles $40,000 from her boss and hits the road, later stopping in at the isolated Bates Motel, and meets the owner and sole employee of the establishment, Norman Bates (the late Anthony Perkins).

The rest of the plot is well-known to anyone who has seen the film, so I won't describe it. Plus, to really describe the rest of the plot in any sort of detail at all will ruin the shocks and surprises that the film has in store for the viewer (most notoriously, the infamous ""shower scene,"" which has to be seen to be believed, and experienced). The ""shower scene"" itself is one of the chief reasons to see this picture; it's shocking, Bernard Herrmann's theme slices away at your eardrums, and it's one of the iconic death scenes - one of the most iconic scenes, period - in movie history.

""Psycho"" is a phenomenal piece of film, from a master filmmaker and an equally talented cast and crew; it's a true cinematic landmark. Most importantly, and the reason why I now hold this film to the high degree that I do now, is that ""Psycho"" is partially (or is it entirely?) responsible for influencing entire generations of filmmakers, particularly those in the horror genre. ""Psycho"" has almost single-handedly influenced, and given rise to, the slasher sub-genre of horror, which of course gave rise to, and is populated by the likes of, Leatherface (from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series), Michael Myers (from the ""Halloween"" series), Jason Voorhees (from the ""Friday the 13th"" series), my personal favorite movie slasher Fred Krueger (from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series), and countless other imitators. ""Psycho"" would itself become fodder for the slasher genre nearly two decades after its release, when it was followed up by three vastly inferior sequels, with Anthony Perkins reprising his signature role as Norman Bates in all three films.

""Psycho"" has also been the subject of a lot of psychiatric and psychological analysis, for those interested in understanding the criminal mind and how it functions. As a criminal justice major in college, in my studies I've across several opportunities to study ""Psycho"" (but never did) and exactly how it influenced the slasher genre and why it's fascinated criminology experts in the decades since its release, thus having even greater influence outside of the film community and American pop culture.

Alfred Hitchcock proved that he was a cinematic genius with ""Psycho,"" since I understand that it is arguably his best and most popular film. At least now I've finally had a chance to see a movie that I've heard so much about and never previously got the chance to watch.

14 July 2005,"since everyone knows the story, let's talk about camera angles and such...","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue"").

2 September 2013,A Key Scene in Depth,"In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation.

Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out.

From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is.

At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escape—how we ""scratch and claw"" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could.

At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like ""in an institution or something"". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's ""harmless"". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go ""a little mad sometimes"". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable façade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one.

This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire.

Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face.

To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.",

30 December 2000,"""A Psychiatrist Doesn't Lay The Groundwork ... He Merely Tries To Explain It.""","A respectable 30-year-old spinster steals $40,000 from her workplace and takes off on a solo car journey to nowhere. She makes the fateful mistake of staying overnight at the Bates Motel ...

There is a difference between a great film, where the cast and technicians seem inspired and the project is carried along on the energy of its ideas, and a merely good film, in which the cleverness is calculated, and the tricks are consciously inserted. ""Psycho"" is merely a good film.

But what cleverness! The incidental music of Bernard Herrman, Hitchcock's composer of choice, has a discordant, staccato leitmotif in the strings which repeats constantly, building almost hypnotically towards the shrill climax of the shower scene. Hitchcock deploys a battery of subtle devices to keep the viewer feeling vaguely uneasy. Sexual frankness was a shocking thing in a mainstream movie in 1960, and the opening scene (showing Marion's ""extended lunch hour"" with Sam) is so sexually honest that it cannot have failed to disturb contemporary cinema audiences. Faces are lit from below or the side, creating an inchoate sense of foreboding. Owls and ravens, traditional omens of evil, preside silently over Norman's parlour. The windshield wiper which fails to clear the rain is a symbol of Marion's guilty conscience.

The film's abiding mood is one of creepy uneasiness, and this is reinforced at every turn by Hitchcock's system of visual imagery. There is, of course, the Old Dark House, but far less obvious techniques are also at work. As Arbogast mounts the stairs, the camera retreats disconcertingly before him. The tines of the rakes in Sam's store are raised like bony, clutching fingers behind Lila's head. Marion's unblinking eyeball is compositionally echoed by the circular plughole, the water draining out as her life force ebbs away.

In the long dialogue scene between Norman and Marion (""We all go a little mad sometimes""), the rhythm of the cutting is exquisite. Sometimes we see the speaker, sometimes the listener, as the rapidity of the cuts forms a counterpoint to the text, and emphasises the discomfort of the characters (Marion wary but self-possessed, Norman outwardly affable but painfully shy).

The cinematic axiom, ""Show it, don't tell it"", is beautifully illustrated in the scene in Marion's bedroom. The camera closes in on the bundles of banknotes lying on the bed, then pans to the packed suitcase, telling us without the need for words that she has decided to take the money and run.

Then something puzzling happens. The film seems to lose all belief in its own precepts, and the rich visual symbolism is abruptly abandoned. Lila opines, ""I'll feel better when all this is explained,"" but she is wrong. The explanation is a huge let-down. We get Dr. Simon, a psychiatrist, lecturing us at tedious length about Norman's condition. ""Show it, don't tell it"" flies out of the window. Maybe Stefano, the scriptwriter, realised that the running time was already over two hours and the thing needed its loose ends tied up rapidly. Perhaps the flat, prosaic ending is the price Hitch has to pay for the slow painstaking build-up in the early reels (it is almost half an hour before Norman makes it onto the screen). Whatever the reason, I for one found the closing section very disappointing.",
6 January 2000,The First Great Slasher,"A truly chilling and creepy film. When I saw it, it wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be but it was an incredibly great film. If you haven't seen this movie and like horror flicks WATCH THIS. And even if you don't like horror that much watch this anyway. It's truly great film by the master of suspense.

The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
2 November 2020,Psycho,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale.

17 January 1999,The Greatest Horror Film Ever,"When you look up the phrase ""Horror Film"" in the dictionary .. a picture of Janet Leigh screaming in a shower should appear next to it. Undoubtedly, Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, bar-none. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing Jason double-spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.

Aside from this though, the movie is flawless. I won't even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween (1978).

The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh as the beautiful Marion Crane, Vera Miles as the concerned sister, Lila Crane, and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins as the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.

I would recommend this movie to any horror movie film fanatic. I would especially recommend this movie to any horror movie fan not desensitized by Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, or Scream .. if such a fan exists.",

6 November 2006,"""A Standard Rave""","Strange what the passage of time can do to a film. I remember seeing portions of ""Psycho"" when I was very young on local TV; when our household became cable-ready a few years later and AMC showed actual movie classics, Hitchcock's film was regular on the rotation. I remember being shocked and impressed by Janet Leigh's shower demise and Martin Balsam's staircase tumble, but not too wild about the actual narrative. When you're less than 10 years old, you take for granted a lot of the nuances of film-making that only make sense when you're older.

And ""Psycho"" is almost entirely nuance and technique. From Anthony Perkins' legendary performance as the quiver-lipped, boyish Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's piercingly authorative, all-strings score to Hitchcock's intersection of characters (where misunderstandings and misplaced responsibility are the norm), the film is a masterful blend of all the elements that make for quality cinema. And for all its pop-culture influence (as it was one of the first 'psychological horrors' put on screen), ""Psycho"" remains extremely subtle and surprising, even if you know all the plot turns in advance.

See Marion. See Marion embezzle $44 grand from her boss. See Marion on the run from her own guilt. See Marion make a fateful stop at the Bates Motel. See Norman. See Norman talk about his abusive, domineering mother... (I needn't go any further.)

Since there is really no creative way to write about a film that has already been so extensively written on, I offer some of my personal favorite moments: The head-on shots of Marion (Janet Leigh) driving away from responsibility, listening to dialogues taking place far away, her facial expressions our only indicator of emotion. The judgmental look of the used-car salesman. The way Norman leans his head forward in the parlor, becoming somber and defensive over the word 'someplace.' The shriek of strings as the shower curtain is pulled back. Norman's awkward reaction to Private Investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam)'s casual questioning. Arbogast's oblivious, seemingly slow-motion ascent of the staircase. Mrs. Bates' closing monologue, delivered in an acrid voice whose tone will literally make your skin crawl.

And there's a lot more. As much as it's been said already, I will have to concur that ""Psycho"" is probably Hitchcock's masterpiece (I haven't seen all of his films), a near-seamless blend of story, character, irony, and technique.",9

30 January 2020,One of the Best from One of the Best,"""Psycho"" is a masterpiece of both filmmaking and storytelling, and it's also probably one of the most influential films ever made (no hyperbole needed). While Alfred Hitchcock's career is stuffed to the gills with thrilling, horrific stories (""Frenzy"", ""The Birds"") and intriguing mysteries (""Vertigo"", ""Rope""), this film is sort of the best of both worlds; it starts off as one thing and morphs into something entirely different. ""Psycho"" has some of the best subversions of expectations I've seen brought to screen, and that's only looking at this movie from a storytelling standpoint; from a filmmaking standpoint, this film is a technical marvel, and that infamous shower scene is to this day being touted as one of the best edited minutes of cinema history (if you've got the time, check out the documentary ""78/52""- about the seventy-eight setups and fifty-two cuts used in the scene). This is my personal favorite of Hitch's films, and I think it's also the best thing he ever made (sorry ""Vertigo"", ""Notorious"", ""Rear Window"", ""North By Northwest"", and ""Rebecca"").

24 October 1999,One of the best movies ever made!,"**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**

This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!

Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!

There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

9 September 2000,The First Modern Horror Classic,"Revolutionary in its time, Hitchcock's Psycho still shocks today when viewed. It is the standard that every horror movie is judged by. Filmed in black and white, everything in this movie--the music, the dialogue, the scenery, etc. is perfectly in sync and is a big reason this movie is a classic. One bad thing is that I read somewhere that one of the goofs in the movie is when Janet Leigh is killed in the bathroom and staring at the camera, you can see her adam's apple moving. I had never noticed that, but after reading that I noticed it the next time I watched it and it sort of ruined the illusion for me. Oh well, that was about the only thing wrong with this movie. Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam are all outstanding. Herrmann's score is one of his best, and there are so many memorable scenes that you just need to go watch it right now. One of Hitch's 5 best.

20 October 2020,Masterpiece of Horror,"Its one of those movies that is by far one of the best of all times. The story is exceptional. The acting is wonderful. The sick and craziness of the theory of Norman Bates is awesome. It takes the genre of Horror and Suspense to whole different level. Perkins made Norman more than a character. Hitchcock delivered a Masterpiece that many would try compare to, but can't.

5 August 2005,Incomparable,"The plot of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film ""Psycho"" is by now the stuff of legend; Marion Crane (Leigh), a secretary in Phoenix is desperate to marry her boyfriend Sam (Gavin), only Sam is still paying off debts from his previous marriage. One Friday a man comes into her real estate office with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for his daughter. Instead of taking the money to the bank as her boss directed, Marion packs her bags and leaves town with the money, presumably to give to Sam so they can finally make a life together. After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer. Unfortunately they all find that as one mystery begins to unravel, another one, more quizzical and shocking is ready to take its place, and none of them are safe from the danger of the Bates Motel.

I'm pretty sure that there isn't much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said; ""Psycho"" being one of the most studied and analyzed films in film history. (I myself took a class in college that examined parts of the film frame by frame, and have read books analyzing the film) However, I have to wonder if the sensation of the film and the fact that it is an instant classic, regardless if someone has seen it or not (truthfully, I have heard people say, ""Oh, that is such a classic."" And then later admit that they haven't yet seen the film at all.), sometimes waters down its mastery and the impact this film had (and continues to have) on the film industry as a whole. If you ever get the opportunity to see the art exhibit ""24 Hour Psycho"", wherein the artist slows the film down to make the running time span an entire day, or if you were to read the excellent book Shower Scene in Hitchcock's Psycho: Creating Cinematic Suspense and Terror by Philip J. Skerry, you can see how incredibly impeccable each frame of the film is. If you were to lay out any scene in the film and look at it frame by frame, you would have some incredibly compelling photographs, and that was exactly how Hitchcock intended his presentation to be.

Aside from being a work of art, it is well known that ""Psycho"" changed the way that moviegoers attended the cinema. Because of the big event that occurs halfway through the film, Hitchcock could not have people continuing their normal practice of strolling into the theater whenever they felt like it. If any of these people came to see a Janet Leigh picture, they would be pretty confused at that point. So Hitchcock, ever the showman (and his own greatest publicist) announced that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie began. This was HUGE for its time. Besides changing the attendance factor, it was one of the greatest publicity stunts of its time. If people weren't going to go to the film before, they sure were going to check it out now. I'm sure that ""Psycho"" doesn't have as much of an impact to people who grew up on slasher films or other horror films, but despite the fact it was released 45 years ago, its secrets are now the stuff of general film knowledge, and personally, the fact that I have studied it clinically, when I went to see it at the classic movie house two weeks ago, I still found that my heart was racing and the hair was standing up on my arms during the very last scene of the film. Even more of a testimony to its impact is the fact that a friend that I attended the film with, who isn't much of a film fan, much less a classic film buff not only said that he was so tense during the film that he was on pins and needles, but that he wanted to see it again, and soon. Why does this film have such a forceful impact nearly five decades after it was first released? I'm sure that one of the several hundred books written about this film and Hitchcock's filmography could give you several reasons at length. But a simple answer may sum it up best for now: It's simply a damn good movie. 9/10

21 October 2013,"""A boy's best friend is his mother. ""","Without a doubt one of the most influential films of all time. Timeless classic.

Whether this is a true slasher film is debatable, but it's influence on the genres of horror and suspense/thriller is undeniable.

This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.

What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.

One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off. See it for the first time (and even a tenth) and enjoy a master director at the peak of his craft.",10
31 October 2005,We All Go a Little Mad Sometimes,"I can't decide whether ""Psycho"" or ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock's best film. My answer on any given day is usually dependent on which one I've most recently watched.

There's no need to go into the performances, or the shocking story, or the Bernard Herrman score (one of the best ever in film history). All that's been covered. Having just watched this film again in honor of Halloween weekend, I was struck fresh by the movie's frankness, which had to have been beyond uncomfortable for film audiences at the time. Supposedly film executives on screening this film were shocked more than anything else by the shots of the toilet in the hotel bathroom. If that was enough to shock, then what about references to transvestites, sexual arousal and release, and the blood-splattered bathroom that Hitchcock shows Perkins cleaning up in rigorous detail? The movie is so honest about the human body, its more unpleasant urges and physical qualities, that when the camera follows a swirl of blood down the shower drain, you half expect to see a big clump of hair sticking out of it. And to think this film came out at the same time as Douglas Sirk was making his films, in which women are as carefully painted and polished as china dolls.

The true test of a great film is how well it stands up to the test of time, and whether or not you can revisit it and find something new in it each time you do so. By that measure, ""Psycho"" is truly one of the greats.

Grade: A+",10
4 May 2014,"Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.","Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.

To pigeonhole this as a thriller would be wrong as per me. It has a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, a huge amount of drama, and even a family backdrop. With all such elements, it would be wrong if I were to categorize this as merely a thriller. Yes, it is filled with thrills and for the 110 minutes of running time, there is hardly any dull moment.

I have seen this movie, a number of times before and each time it had a terrific impact. Also, I have always found something new, maybe a new frame, new shot or a new background sound. The discovery does not seem to stop. This I attribute to the many elements that are involved in this film.

From placing the camera, composing the shot, revealing the right emotion and making the audiences wait till the shocking aspect is revealed, Hitchcock is at his best in this film. This is indeed one of the more simpler stories he dealt. Yet, he made it so impact full that it continues to surprise audiences even today. Thanks to the music by Bernard Hermann, whose contribution to the film is very important. I cannot imagine this film without the music and I believe that it's because of the music, that the resonance was acquired.

If it's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impact full. Now, I do not want to reveal those and give away some details. I can simply say, I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else.

The cast is perfect equally, Anthony Perkins does a wonderful job as Norman Bates. He is cold blooded and yet looks so deceptively humane as an extremely caring human. This film and ""The Trial"" are perhaps the most important films in his career.

It is the first psychological thriller of it's kind as I read in various other sites and perhaps it is also the most violent films made. Though the violence comes for less than 10 minutes, it haunts so brutally, as if it was there all through the film.

It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest films of all time by one of the greatest directors.

17 June 2000,Hitchcock's best,"""Psycho"" is Alfred Hitchcock's best film. The Master of Suspense directed a lot of great films throughout his astonishing career such as ""North by Northwest"", ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", and ""The Birds"". But ""Psycho"" is my all-time favorite Hitchcock movie. Everything about this movie is great in every way. From the splendid performances by the entire cast (especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in their most famous roles) to Bernard Herrmann's eerie and famous music score to Hitchcock's use of unusual camera angles to the site of the Bates Motel and the creepy house that sits above it to the dark humor that is presented and to that unforgettable shower scene, ""Psycho"" is a brilliant horror film that will live on for years to come. Now just forget about that stupid shot-by-shot remake from 1998. The original 1960 picture is definitely the one to see.

27 August 2020,Really wasn't expecting to love this so much,"I wasn't all that impressed with Rear Window or Blackmail and was ready to write Hitchcock off as a director that just wasn't for me, but I definitely can't say I've been as scared by a film anywhere near this old before. Those strings. And that cinematography. I realised it's all the little things Hitchcock does that makes him the ""master of suspense"", even in the first act before the Bates Motel is even remotely part of the film, it's still so nail-biting watching Marion make her escape, but when it culminates in THAT scene, christ. I do feel as though the second act is a little too slow and predictable, however, but the third, and ESPECIALLY that final scene, bring it home so well. ""She wouldn't even harm a fly..."" ughhhhhh the chills

18 April 2000,Timeless thriller that will keep even the Generation-X'ers on the edge of their seats.,"Three years ago at the tender age of thirteen, I watched this great film, and loved it from beginning to end! Not only does it sport a fantastic cast of old character actors (Vera Miles, Jeanette Nolan, Martin Balsam etc.), but the classic, instantly recognizable, scissor-like score is one of Bernard Herrmann's best since his days with CBS, composing for Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone! You must see this film, especially if your an old-film nut like me.

15 October 1998,The scariest ever...,"I saw this movie as a teenager when it was first released in the 1960's. The promotional hype for the film ensured you did not have a clue what it was about and people who had seen the movie were asked not to reveal the ending. You went to see it anticipating something scary and thats what you got. Even 30 years later I still remember sitting in a dark theatre with my heart pumping and everyone, and I mean everyone, screaming their lungs out.

The movie set a new and very high standard in horror movies which I don't believe has ever been equaled. The characters were great, the direction perfect and the music, which I thought was absolutely fantastic, made this a classic.

I still get scared when I see it on TV.

26 June 2013,I'm a little bit psycho for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. It's amazing!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
30 May 2000,The best.,"After stealing a considerable amount of cash from her employer, Janet Leigh goes on the run. But she makes the fatal mistake of stopping at the Bates Motel for the night.

One of the best films of all time; presenting terrfic direction, striking sets, memorable lines, and one heck of a shower scene. It is also able to inject themes of sexual repression, guilt, and possible incest into its narrative. Making it all the more terrifying.

This movie deserves to be in every serious movie fan's collection. A PERFECT 10 out of 10.

25 October 2015,more than classic,"that kind of film who is more than a classic, a gem or a masterpiece. because it is a revolution. not easy to define but powerful for transform a genre and for inspire an industry. courageous, strange, surprising. at each new meeting. because it remands the force of art of a cinema genius. the scene of shower, the performance of Anthony Perkins- first victim of the film's success -, the birds and the last scenes are parts of cultural references. one of the great roles by Janet Leigh, the film is large arena of secrets, vulnerabilities, solutions and falls.and map of emotions with almost cold precision. because it is only about lost people and the search of sense for their life.

21 November 2009,A must-see,"Especially if you are into thrillers. I haven't seen the shot-by-shot remake that came out, 10 years or so ago, but if you watch one Psycho, it should be this one. Actually if you watch more than one Psycho, it would be good if you'd watch the other Psychos (Psycho 2, 3 and so forth). Although they are with Anthony Perkins, I'm pretty sure they are not as good as this one though.

A very eerie performance by Mr. Perkins then, with a very interesting idea (that hopefully comes as a surprise when you watch it, because it would be a shame if someone did spoil you the movie, by telling you what will happen). Quite a few things get done here and other directors have taken those ideas and used them time and again. It's a testament to Hitchcocks genius, how good his movie works and still how much tension is in it, because it hasn't aged a bit.

A great movie, by a great director. I watched it recently at a cinema, but I have to admit, that I missed the small cameo Hitchcock has in his movies. That's saying something about how gripping the movie was for me. And since I hadn't seen it for quite some time, I really discovered quite a few things, by watching it. So even if you have seen it, you can watch it again and again!",10
16 September 1999,The greatest Thriller/Horror ever created !,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
18 August 2000,A Chilling Classic.,"The first time I saw Psycho, I watched the first 20 minutes and stopped the tape. I thought it was boring. But, alas, I rented it again a few weeks ago and I didn't like it. Didn't like it at all. I bloody loved it! Psycho is a freakin' masterpiece! It is easily Alfred Hitchcock's best film, and it is definitely an unforgettable chilling classic. Anthony Perkins was brilliant as Norman Bates, I will certainly look out for more of his work in the coming months. Janet Leigh was also very impressive, she was a real gem of Psycho.

So, don't make the same mistake I did, watch this classic today, and I guarantee you'll never forget it.

27 November 2000,"Legendary, in both a good and a bad way","Not much to be said about this that hasn't been said before. Only the second Hitchcock film I've ever seen, and so far there isn't a single positive thing that's been said about him that I can disagree with. Calling someone 'The Master' is terminology that I would usually frown upon as being too dismissive of other greatly talented people, but after witnessing the directing, the cinematography, the subtle performances, the inimitable atmosphere and the quiet genius of this masterpiece, I find myself forced to agree. The notorious shower scene manages to be shocking, brutal and understated all at once, and its infamy on the pages of motion picture history is well-deserved. Anthony Perkins is subtly explosive, like a match waiting to be struck. He plays Bates with a boyish, grinning charm that generally belies his chilling insanity. Also worthy of mention is Bernard Herrmann's incredible score, possibly one of the best I've ever heard.

In a curious way, the one thing I find disagreeable about this movie is, indeed, its legend. I cannot imagine how much I would have enjoyed it had I not known any of the plot twists beforehand, and could have gone into it unknowingly. Still, perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the legend is completely due, because this film's merit becomes obvious when you consider that first-time viewers of my generation (I'm 21 years old), who have become inundated with the blood, gore and overblown special effects of today's blockbusters, can still find its subtle ingenuity chilling and scary in equal measure. Beautiful. 10/10",10

27 December 2005,A Classic,"Psycho is considered by many critics and audiences as the best horror film ever made. I don't think it is that but it is still impossible to say that it is not a great film and is one of the best horror films ever, maybe top five, but not one. Alfred Hitchcock is on the other hand the best director ever to grace the cinema. He has created some of the best films ever and has never made a bad one. Some of his best are the original The Man Who Knew too Much, Psycho, and North By Northwest. The plot to Psycho is amazing, every thing seems more real than you would expect from this kind of film. The screenplay is also great. With very good characters and dialogue. The screenplay is also very daring doing very new things. The performances are also great. Anthony Perkins in particular is amazing but everyone give great performances. Janet Leigh is probably second best in her Oscar nominated performance. She brings her character to life very well, but Perkins doesn't. He just becomes that character, and that is one of the best performances in history. The visual effects are excellent for the time and would stand up fairly well for today. This is one of Hotchcocks best films and is one to watch over and over and over again.",10

26 February 2001,Hitchcock At His Very Best,"Psycho is the all time greatest movie ever made in movie making history. It has this special style that could only be achieved through the eyes of Alfred Hitchcock and the excellent actors in the film. There is this mysteriousness that presides over the movie, and that is what adds to the overall feeling from Psycho. Hitchcock's eye for great suspense really does the trick for this movie. He also chose to go Black and White in this movie, instead of color for his own stylistic purposes (and to hide the redness of...yeah.) The B&W really makes the movie more ""scary"". No one can forget the Bates Motel or the mysterious house on the hill behind it with ""that person"" in the window. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates also has his best performance of his career in this movie, bringing the character of Norman Bates to life. Even 40 years later, no movie is able to stand up to Psycho or make a larger impact on world culture. Truly the best movie of all time, definitely a 10/10.

23 December 2018,Hitchcock's Magnum Opus,"Psycho has to be Hitchcock's magnum opus it's that brilliant. It's a masterful symbiosis of plot, story, acting and directing. I would say that Psycho is the genesis of the slasher movie. That may or may not be something to be proud of considering many of the slashers out there but I would venture to say that Psycho is the first.

Also among the firsts would have to be Norman Bates. That name needs no introduction or any description much like Jason Voorhees, Michael Meyers, Freddy Kruger, and Chucky. If there were a conference of them all then Norman would be in the godfather's seat. The performance by Anthony Perkins was stellar. From the talkativeness to the jittery, stammering nervousness, to the mad silence as the voice in his head spoke he was terrific. Too many performances in the 50's and 60's were stuffy, not so Anthony Perkins. Hitchcock chose the perfect actor to make this film legendary.

4 September 1999,"Great movie, kept me guessing till the end.","I saw Psycho last night at the campus movie theatre and it was great, not to mention scary. I mean I had never seen it before (except for parts on TV when I was small) and had no clue about the plot or the ending. Untill the final scene I still thought it was the mother. Now I'm one of those guys who can pick out the ending like half way through the film, but Psycho had me fooled all the way to the end. Psycho may be great to watch again and again, but its even better the first time.

The makers of Halloween realised this and even named one of their main characters after a character in Psycho: Sam Loomis. So if wanted to see the movie that stared the slasher genre this it. Worth the time and money to see.

3 August 2023,10/10,"This movie is a classic for a reason. The lack of special effects, CGI and stuff used in movies now does not stop 'Psycho' from sending a chill down the spine. Unlike movies like 'The Exorcist' that relies on swearing, disfigured face and the infamous pea-soup vomit (which, by the way, makes the movie much less scary when watched today, but it is understandable why it was such a classic horror flick in its day) to produce its scares, 'Psycho' relies on its actors and their performance - which is why it still holds up today. There isn't a single boring or unwanted scene, and the plot is fast-paced enough to hold our attention, and at the same time, not overwhelmingly so. This is a movie that still remains a classic even though sixty-odd years have passed since its release. It deserves at least one watch and won't be boring even if you re-watch it.

9 January 2022,Classic Hitchcock,"Absconding with $40,000 of her boss's money, Marion Crane sets off to join her lover Sam Loomis. After a tiring journey through the rain, she stops at a lonely motel run by Norman Bates , an intense young man living in the remote house with his domineering mother...

Psycho is a magnificent spine-chiller, considered one of Hitchcock's greatest films, in which he develops new heights of suspense and psychological terror, and features a terrifying performance by Anthony Perkins, who plays Norman Bates, the owner of the Bates motel. He's innocent, charming, then is twitching with annoyance. The last scene of him is spine-chilling with the camera zooming close to his face. And speaking of camera angles, Hitchcock utilises this technique well, adding to the claustrophobic tension. The close attention to detail is superb - the sense of dread well played - of course all helped by the spinechilling music.

Of course, Psycho is famous for that shower scene, which is really frightening , mainly because the victim is contained in a small space, vulnerable - and you see how helpless Janet Leigh's character is. Her acting is superb. In an interview she had mentioned how she's scared to look at that scene.

The rest of the cast - including Martin Balsam, Vera Miles and John Gavin - is great, but of course Perkins steals the scene easily.",10
12 March 1999,Hithchcock's masterpiece,"""Psycho"" still remains a classic after thirty-eight years. It had been imitated by so many slasher films such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and ""Scream."" Not even the pointless 1998 remake can beat Alfred Hitchcock's original. Anthony Perkins delivers a sincere performance as the mama's boy, Norman Bates who runs a motel. Janet Leigh also turns in a good performance as the embezzler Marion Crane who checks in and gets stabbed repeatedly in the famous shower scene. Even the Bernard Herman score is very suspenseful. The only slasher film that comes close to perfection is ""Halloween."" Remember: the key is suspense, NOT blood and gore. My evaluation: **** out of ****.

18 November 2000,The Best In Its Time,"This movie is the best movie by Alfred Hitchcock ever. That is hard to do to. Because he did all the good scary movies back then such as Rear Window and The Birds. I loved it I own the movie and parts 2 and 3 I like the shower scene. Another good thing about this movie was that it had a good back ground the motel off the main highway and the creepy old house on the hill behind the motel this was scary for its time but not now. However it still is a real good movie a classic. The remake was ok but it can't match to this one.

19 October 2021,Not a frame is wasted in this iconic Hitchcock thriller,"I consider Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho to be a perfect movie. Not a frame is wasted in this iconic thriller. This film skillfully introduces relatable characters and develops engaging plotlines, and it masterfully builds suspense before pulling the rug (or shower curtain) out from under you. This is my favorite Hitchcock film. And if you happen to find someone who doesn't know the twists and turns of this terrifying tale, it's so much fun to introduce them to Norman Bates and his mother.

22 August 2021,Thank you Mr. Hitchcock,"I've seen a lot of people who watched this movie and considered it a ""bad movie"", I understand them, but I didn't agree with them.

Since they don't watch old movies, these kinds of movies seem boring to them, because nowadays, after watching movies with plenty of jump scares, this movie doesn't feel scary. But for me, this movie is great.

Thank you Mr. Hitchcock.

3 July 2019,"A classic in chills and creepiness, nuf said","Marion (Janet Leigh) works for a real estate agent and earns, most likely, very little bucks in the late fifties. She loves a handsome gentleman named Sam (John Gavin) but, alas, his divorce has left his prospects dim, as a good deal of his money goes to his ex-wife. In fact, he lives in another California town, behind the hardware store he runs. Marion is getting tired of meeting Sam in cheap hotels and listening to his weak promises. One day, a crooked businessman comes in with $40,000 cash for a house he is buying for his daughter, who is marrying soon. Marion's boss is aghast to hold this much money so he sends Marion to the bank on a Friday afternoon. The money never gets deposited. Going a bit ""crazy"", Marion takes the cash and runs north, thinking this will allow Sam to marry her. But, a heavy downpour makes Marion stop at an out-of-the-way motel, The Bates. Greeted by the motel's owner, Norman ( a superb Anthony Perkins), Marion soon learns she is the only guest and is given the best room. Norman even brings her a meal, over the objections of his mother, who Marion sees in a window and hears from the 'big house"" behind the motel. After she eats, Marion decides maybe she should take the money back in the morning and steps into the shower. Suddenly and ghastly, Marion is stabbed to death by, its assumed, Norman's mother. Norman cleans the place up and sinks Marion's car, along with the money, into a pond near the motel. All too soon, Sam and Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) are looking for her. A private eye goes snooping, too, hired by the man with the bucks, for he can't notify the police. When the PI gets to the Bates, Norman's mother makes short work of him, too. Another car goes swimming and sinks. But, when Sam and Lila likewise trail Marion to the Bates, will more deaths ensue? Is there bigger secrets afoot? You bet! This classic tale of a psychosis and murder is rightly one of Hitchcock's most famous films. DEFINITELY SCARIER THAN SCARY, many folks never take a shower again after viewing it. Perkins is beyond great as the weird Norman and Leigh, Gavin, and Miles do their parts quite nicely. The twist at the end is compelling while, even in black and white, the film's production is stunning. Don't miss this one if you dare!",10
27 October 2020,Masterful,"Where do you even begin with a film like Psycho. Everything about it is so masterfully done that there is very little that can be said. In addition, anything that could be said has already been said by others. Regardless, I will now tell you how I feel about Psycho and why I think that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

Where this movie really shines, is in building tension. Not a single scene or moment goes by where you aren't kept wondering what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. As soon as Marion leaves in her car, the tension starts to build. And not until the words, 'The End', appear on the screen, does that tension ease. There are, of course, stand out scenes, such as the infamous shower scene, or the staircase scene with Arbogast. However, what to me is even more impressive, is Hitchcock's ability to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat for the entire run time.

Everything about this film is simply sublime. The music, the sound effects, the acting (especially Anthony Perkins as Bates), the locations, and perhaps most importantly, the pacing. The steady stream of clues and new mysteries keep you guessing throughout the film, making sure that there isn't a dull moment.

If you haven't seen Psycho already, make sure you do. It is one of those rare films where I can't think of anything to change or add. And to be completely honest with you, I believe, as do many others, that this is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever created.",10
30 May 2022,A true classic,"Every time I watch ""Psycho"" I feel like I'm in a film class. I find myself studying everything that going on in the movie. Director Alfred Hitchcock and company created a masterpiece with ""Psycho"". Everything about it works. It doesn't matter how many times I've seen this movie, it still grabs me right from the start and never lets go.

1 November 2019,"""Mother? She's *harmless!*"" (laughs, nervously) ""As *harmless* as one of those *stuffed birds*!""","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
18 November 2021,Ordinary and mundane meets extraordinary and insane,"A day in the life of Marion Crane is expertly documented. Note every detail, every nuance, everywhere. Marion' morning is humdrum. Everything then changes - in an impulsive decision. Then, the game of consequence begins and ends in a living nightmare. Yet, Hitch manages to distort time and reality. The audience imagines Leigh is only on screen for a few minutes. Musical score is phenomenal.

29 October 2021,An Important Film to Cinema History,"This film I have fond memories of. My mother showed it to me when I was growing up and despite my not liking black and white films then, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I thought the twist was absolutely amazing and the cultural significance of this film is immense. I've seen his movie many times throughout the years, with the last few times in the theater. I even took Jaime, as she had never seen this version as well. The official synopsis is a Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother.

We kick off this one with a couple in a motel room. The woman is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her lover is Sam Loomis (John Gavin). They meet up here because they aren't married. Sam loves her, but he is divorced and has a lot of debts. Marion loves him and wants to marry. She is getting frustrated with their relationship. She just wants to be with him. This is an interesting dynamic for the time period.

That is when something pops up that could help their situation. Her boss brings in a client that is trying to buy a house for his daughter and comes in with $40,000 in cash. Marion is asked to take it to the bank. She inquires if she can go home afterwards due to a headache. What she really does is heads home, packs and tries to flee. Her boss sees her in the car though or at least he thinks he does.

What I really like about the next sequence is that Marion is hearing the voices of everyone back in Phoenix. She is thinking about what is probably happening, even though she has until Monday to get away, as these events happened on a Friday. I like this, because this is exactly what I do about a lot of situations in my life. I will play them in my head for all possible scenarios, your normal overthinker. It does seem these are the exact conversations that are being had as well.

Marion has a run-in with a highway patrol officer and this causes her to trade in her car and buy a used one. She then plays out what happens there in head as well. She doesn't make things easier as she comes off very suspicious. She is vague in her answers and she does things that are highly unusual.

It starts to rain so she pulls off to a motel. It turns out to be the Bates Motel and she meets with the proprietor, Norman (Anthony Perkins). They get along pretty well and it is clear that he is attracted to her. There is an issue that arises with his mother and him not giving her dinner. This all leads to the infamous shower scene.

Something that I didn't notice in my previous viewings of this film is that Marion changes her mind about what she is trying to do after she speaks with Norman. This makes what happens to her effect me even more, because she is going to try to do the right thing despite what she did. I also want to comment on the impact of what happens to her as well. Most of us already know the twist here, heck I believe there are a lot of people who know this scene without even seeing this film. This is iconic, because it changes cinema and influences great films like Scream.

When Marion goes missing, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) seeks out Sam and so does Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), a private detective who is searching out the stolen money. This all leads everyone back to the Bates Motel and to learn the truth about Norman and his mother.

The issues with Norman are also interesting. It isn't the textbook definition of split personalities, as they can talk to each other. The final images we see in the fruit cellar end up influencing films going forward like Dressed to Kill.

Acting in this film is also quite amazing. Perkins is perfect as Norman. The novel has him overweight and kind of greasy looking. This film makes it unnerving that he has the boy next door looks and he seems quite harmless. Knowing what he is capable of though makes it that much scarier. Miles and Gavin are solid as the two who are trying to figure out what happened to Marion. Leigh is amazing and what happens to her is iconic for cinema to come. The rest of the cast round out the film very well for what was needed also.

Runtime on the film is 109 minutes, but it doesn't feel like it. We move through the plot points at a good clip. I even thought it was interesting that I knew the outcome of the mystery, but this time around I was focusing more on things that I didn't notice in previous viewings of the film. The only thing that I didn't like is the psychologist who is explaining Norman and his psyche. I don't mind it to an extent, but I think it goes too far. It is interesting getting in giallo films, as they took this concept along with villains across genres. The final image of Norman is great as is the actual reveal as well.

As for the effects, there aren't a lot of them. A lot of this goes to the time period and what they could show. The shower scene is amazing though. We never actually see the knife penetrating due to the great editing, but we feel like we see it. The blood is good in that the water is washing some of it away and the splatters look realistic. The final image of the film has a cool effect that I had never noticed until these later viewings. The film is also shot amazing. I come to expect that from an Alfred Hitchcock film though.

Something that really helps make this film feel eerie is the Bernard Herrmann's score. I actually listen to this one when I'm writing, because the music sets the perfect mood. There are some scenes that aren't even scary as to what we are seeing, but the music gives it such an unnerving feeling that it gets my anxiety going. The music cues during the shower scene are also iconic.

Now with that said, this film is a classic. It is important film for many genres. It helped to spark the slasher films that could come a couple decades later. There is the issue of man being the monster and mental illness. It is shocking what it does with a popular actress like Leigh and quite iconic as well. The rest of the acting is great as is the story overall. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but what is used are great as is how the film is directed. The score also definitely helps this film and is also quite amazing. If you've never seen this classic, I recommend giving it a viewing. Even if you know what the reveal is, it is fun to try to pick out things to reinforce it. This film is very near perfect.",10

6 March 2003,A modern suspense classic and one of the most influential movies of all time.,"'Psycho' is one of the most famous and talked about suspense movies ever made. In fact it has been copied, ripped off and parodied so many times it's often easy to underrate it, but every time I watch it it really works for me. No matter how many times you view it you will notice something new, some shot or bit of business that impresses. Of course there's hardly a movie fan on the planet who doesn't know the major twists in the plot (like the original 'Planet Of The Apes' even people who have never seen it know what's going to happen), but that doesn't really matter, there's more than enough going on here to enjoy. Hitchcock's direction is masterful, and the movie has been hugely influential. Not just obvious films like William Castle's 'Homicidal' or Brian De Palma's 'Sisters' (and let's not even mention Gus Van Sant's misguided remake of some years back!), but Italian giallo and the whole slasher sub-genre wouldn't be the same without 'Psycho'. Even film makers outside the horror/suspense field have been influenced by it, Quentin Tarantino for example. One very famous shot in 'Psycho' is deliberately quoted in 'Pulp Fiction'. The cast of 'Psycho' are all very good, particularly Janet Leigh ('Touch Of Evil') and Vera Miles ('The Searchers') as the Crane sisters, and Martin Balsam ('Cape Fear') as Detective Arbogast. The real stand out performance is by the late Anthony Perkins ('The Trial') as Norman Bates. He is absolutely superb and surely deserved an Oscar. 'Psycho' is one of THE great American movies and should be watched and enjoyed by any movie fan. Hitchcock made many outstanding films, but 'Psycho' must rank with the best of them. A classic movie that has stood the test of time, I don't doubt that it will influence generations of film makers to come.",
9 August 2021,Psycho(1960),"Timeless Chills The concept, based on the 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, is elemental. A woman flees a bad decision, and lands in the lair of a predator who is falling deep into his own psychosis. By the time he made PSYCHO, Hitchcock had directed dozens of films. He was acknowledged as the Master of Suspense, with the capital letters in that honorary title always implied in conversation. Hitchcock knew exactly how to construct a scene to evoke and exploit specific feelings. His style on PSYCHO was brisk and economical, and could be exceptionally brutal.

Nowhere is that more apparent than in the murder of Marian Crane, played by the film's lone marquee movie star, Janet Leigh. No one going into PSYCHO expected Leigh's character to be killed off halfway through the movie, much less for it to happen in a dramatic and shattering sequence. The screeching strings and deep notes of the score by composer Bernard Herman turned the shower scene into a grueling horror showcase and sealed the movie's first major murder as a cinematic all-timer. The scene is created with such great skill that it has power even today, even after being endlessly homaged, parodied, replicated and ripped off. The shower scene lasts all of three minutes, but that 180 seconds echoes through decades of cinema.

All Stripped Down PSYCHO is entrenched as part of movie culture now, but its future was far from certain in 1960. Maybe you think of PSYCHO as an ""old movie"" (it is!), which makes its black and white aesthetic seem entirely appropriate. At the time, however, color was the norm for movies, especially for big pictures like those made by Alfred Hitchcock. His last movie before PSYCHO was NORTH BY NORTHWEST, a splashy caper starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. A hard-edged black and white thriller was an abrupt deviation from expectations.

Paramount didn't want to make PSYCHO, so Hitchcock paid for it himself and produced it on the cheap. That meant using his ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" production crew. Another money saving measure was the use of black and white film. All in all, PSYCHO cost under a million bucks; it was a fast, no-frills affair.

A useful side benefit of shooting in black and white was that it helped hide some of the movie's gore. In 1960, Hollywood studios were still loosely bound by the fast-withering constraints of the production code. For decades, the production code had specified content seen as inappropriate for Hollywood movies. Explicit sex and violence were forbidden, and even implied content was strictly controlled. But the production code was on the way to obsolescence, and PSYCHO - which became a hit in part because of its shocking content - helped usher it out the door. No one had ever seen a movie like PSYCHO from Alford Hitchcock, or from any other major filmmaker working with an American studio.

No Spoilers... or Else!

Movie audiences now are averse to spoilers in a way that is fairly different from the norm in 1960, when it wasn't uncommon for ticket-buyers to walk into a movie at any point during the running time, then sit through a program of a feature or two and multiple shorts. Hitchcock's well-documented flair for publicity, combined with exceptional word-of-mouth, helped turn PSYCHO into a bona fide hit.

As specified by the director, PSYCHO was promoted with a forbidding warning: No one would be admitted to the theatre after the movie began. Rather than turning audiences off from the movie, that stipulation created interest, and lines, and an ever-expanding audience.

A Horrific Legacy PSYCHO led to sequels (two of which are surprisingly good), an eyebrow-raising shot-for-shot remake by Gus Van Sant (which is an oddly compelling experiment) and a five-season television prequel series, ""Bates Motel."" Those are just the direct descendents of the movie; the entire slasher genre owes a debt to Hitchcock, just as horror movies in general enjoy a popularity that might not be quite the same without this benchmark-setting shocker.",10

11 January 2000,The Best,"This movie was the best Psycho movie ever. The Remake did not have half the good acters in this film.

I think this movie did a good job on telling about all the characters and who they are and what they do.

I believe this was the film that made Anthony Perkins famous.

It starts with a women named Maron Crane. A Secretary for some rich company. So when she is asked to deliver money to the bank she takes the money. But the money never got there. As the day went by she had so much stress on her mind. So she left town and that was the last anyone had saw her. So on that night it was raining hard so she stops at a low down hotel called the Bates Motel. She then meets the owner of the Hotel Norman Bates. Who lives in a House above the hotel. For awhile the 2 talk with Norman having a crush on her. Then somtime later Maron is taking a shower when she is attacked by a killer.

For days the town and Marons sister tried to find her. But no luck.

I won't ruin the rest.",
4 March 2005,Psycho,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
29 March 2000,One to remember,"Well this movie still is one to remeber. Why.

Well it was the one that started all the slasher movies. It was the movie that inspired Halloween.

The characters in the movie are pretty good. The story was strong and some what powerful.

I also liked the setting and the dark skies and the rain. It made me relax

But it will always be the best black and while movie along side Night of the Living Dead

10 February 1999,"One of the scariest, and best horror films of all time!!","Psycho is a pure classic, that along with Halloween is the scariest movie ever made. Anthony Perkins stars as the famous Norman Bates, who in fact is a psycho. Now how he comes in the story is this: Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, she steals $40,000 from her boss, flees the town, and buys a new car. She decides to stay at a hotel, cleverly named The Bates Motel (Vacancy). Run by a timid, yet sweet man whose name is Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), now this man, is attracted to this woman, asked her for dinner, she declines. Now for the most famous scene in a horror film, she decides to take a shower, while he watches. He hears his mom calling him, so he goes up and sees what's wrong. While Marion Crane is taking a shower, the mother comes down and brutally stabs her to death. After all this, and people start to notice that she is gone, her sister and her boyfriend, decide to check out this motel. They hire an investigator to look into it. He finds nothing wrong with the place. What happens to him? Well you'll have to see the movie. Anyway, the sister and boyfriend, investigate and find out what Norman Bates really is. The film is extremely well-acted, not to mention directed by the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock. All the cast-mates support a wonderful script, and make this lively, scary, and classic horror movie a must-see. A 10!!! Unrated/Rated R for intense violence and some brief nudity.",10
14 October 2005,Pure Cinema,"The hardest movies to review are the accepted classics. What can be said that hasn't already been said? And how can I write a glowing review that offers up genuine love and appreciation for the film, and not just regurgitate some propaganda that Psycho is the greatest slasher ever made? Well, here goes nothing . . .

From imitation and its popularity among film scholars and horror buffs, Psycho has no more surprises left  that's a given. However, Sir Alfred Hitchcock foresaw this problem and infused Psycho (as well as his other pictures) with the more effective element: suspense. We know where, why, and when the murders take place. So what? The key to Hitchcock's famous bomb analogy is that suspense comes from the audience's knowledge of the bomb, not a lack of knowledge. We know, but the characters do not. That's suspense.

I watched Psycho again just recently, and felt an unprecedented excitement as those famous Bernard Herrmann strings began playing and Saul Bass' credits filled the screen. I was watching one of my favorite movies again, and I couldn't wait to dive into the film, itself. I couldn't wait for that opening shot of Phoenix  I looked forward to seeing that look of horror on Marion Crane's face as her bosses crosses the street in front of her car while she's escaping to Fairvale. I wanted to see Anthony Perkins to appear on screen with his brilliantly subdued performance of Norman Bates, and I leaned closer to the screen and smiled when he says, ""We all go a little crazy sometimes.""

Needless to say, I love this movie.

What amazes me about Psycho, and I didn't consciously realize this until reading the Truffaut book ""Hitchcock"", is how the film manages to smoothly switch protagonists midway through the film (from Marion to Norman). As Hitchcock and Truffaut talk in the book, when the car is pushed into the swamp and it stops  the audience's heart stops. We want the car to sink, and we want Norman to succeed. More amazingly is how even after knowing all the revelations the film has to offer  the truth about Norman Bates and his mother  we still want that car to sink. We still sympathize with Norman Bates in that moment.

That, in my opinion, is what truly separates Hitchcock's Psycho from the pack. Sir Alfred actually made us care about his killer. I can't think of any other slasher film that attempts this and succeeds. Most slashers are content to have a killing machine under a mask, but only Hitchcock has the balls to show us the face of his killer. Only Hitchcock would dare to make his killer a full-fledged characters with intelligent thoughts and complex emotions, and only Hitchcock was good enough to pull it off.

As if that's not enough, in the final act Hitch plays the audience like an organ and switches our sympathies once again (from Norman to Lila)  and all the while, the audience never really consciously recognizes that their loyalties fly from character to character on a whim. We want Marion to succeed because the man she's stealing from is a prick, we want Norman to succeed because of the love for his mother and his humanness in reacting to the murder, and we want Lila to succeed because we want to know the truth behind Norman Bates' mother.

One of my favorite moments in all of cinema occurs in Psycho. Watch the film while Sam Loomis is searching and calling out for Detective Arbogast at the Bates' motel. Then Hitch cuts to a slow fluid push in on Anthony Perkins at the swamp, and Perkins looks up at the camera with a mixture of emotions in his eyes. It's one of the simplest camera movements in the film. Perkins doesn't say a word - he just quietly looks on. Yet it's one of the most effective shots in the entire film. A simple movement and silent look is all Hitchcock needs.

When the marketing gimmicks have all been forgotten, when all the surprises are known, and when imitators have sucked away and blatantly stolen whatever they can get to work for 45 years, Psycho still stands as solid as ever. It did not need the shock of killing its star, nor did it need the shocking revelation at the end, it didn't need the gimmick that ""audiences won't be admitted after the start of the picture."" Psycho works just as well without them because Hitchcock delivered great characters played by competent actors, and he let the audience know there's a bomb waiting to go off that none of those characters know about.",

16 May 2014,The original slasher villain,"There's a lot to say about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). For one thing, it would not have lit the fuse to the explosion of other unique slasher villains that everyone comes to know and enjoy at the movies. As crazy as this idea was back in the day, Hitchcock was able to push the boundaries of suspense and create a legend that practically no one can forget. Thankfully everything here is put together in such a way that it amounts to a very clever, creepy and disturbing movie.

The story is about a girl named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is given a huge sum of money and is expected to deposit in the bank. However, she becomes greedy and decides to run off with it. While on her escape, she decides to rest at an old motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). There she learns that Norman is under the strict rule of his mother and that he's a slight bit unsettling. However, she doesn't realize how unsettling Norman really is. Co-starring Perkins and Leigh are several other veteran actors like Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and John McIntire.

The writing is based off of Robert Bloch's work of the same name. Bloch himself had based it off of the disturbing real story of Ed Gein of Plainfield Wisconsin in 1957. What's great though is that Hitchcock kept everything identical to the book. Every scene that is depicted gives momentum to the plot and helps make the tension that much more gripping. The best actor here is Anthony Perkins. Not only are his reactions real but also feel genuine. For example, when telling a lie and then being found out, he tries to cover his tracks. He is able to do so but speaks nervously.

As for the year, 1960 had some graphic violence come into play. Not enough to shock anyone, but creative enough to let the audiences' imagination run wild. Also, just because the film is in black and white doesn't mean for any viewer who doesn't like the ""old"" films, can't be entertained either. With the simplicity of color, there are other things for the viewer to watch and notice. Having only black and white actually simplifies the viewing experience for the audience. Accompanying that is Bernard Herrmann's all string score, with one of the most iconic tunes taking place in a shower scene. If you want to know where slasher films began, it's here.

Norman Bates is the original slasher villain. Audiences will be clinging to the disturbing story, the acting is great and the music is memorable.",10
15 March 1999,Set the standard,"1960. Alfred Hitchcock is, for his time, king of the world, with a string of hit movies, a hit TV show, and even growing critical respect (from ""auteur"" critics like Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut). Flush with all of this success, did Hitchcock continue making the glossy entertainments he excelled at in the 1950's? No. Instead, he made a low-budget film which was obviously influenced by B-movies (notably the ones made by William Castle) and what he had learned on TV. The result was PSYCHO, and it's safe to say movies were never the same again.

Many articles have been written claiming Spielberg and Lucas have been responsible for the decline of movies today, and have been responsible for more cheap rip-offs than anyone else. It seems to me Hitchcock and PSYCHO have inspired (if that's the right word) more rip-offs than Spielberg or Lucas put together. Not just the obvious ways, like the many horror films which pay homage to it (DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN), or the films which have spoofed it(HIGH ANXIETY). There's also its influence in narrative(speeding things up, instead of taking time to tell the story), its reliance on fairly thin characters, sparse dialogue, and of course, that music. Someone more qualified than I could go at length at how Hitchcock's technique here has echoed throughout moviemaking today, but that influence to is undeniable. I guess to sum up, PSYCHO does what Spielberg, Lucas, and every blockbuster film have been accused of doing; making a B-movie on the scale of an A-movie(of course, Hitchcock had a lower budget, but he did have stars like Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, and well-known actors like John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles).

As the rip-offs shouldn't put you off the Spielberg and Lucas films, nor should the rip-offs put you off of PSYCHO(I haven't seen the remake yet, but I still want to). No matter how many times you've seen it before, the shower scene still packs a wallop. So does the climax in the basement, and the final shot of Norman. Perkins avoids the mistake most movie psychos (pardon the expression) make today by hamming it up; although you suspect something, you're prepared to dismiss him until you find out the truth. This isn't my favorite Hitchcock (that honor goes to NORTH BY NORTHWEST), but it's a classic.",10

19 December 2021,Clean. Clever. Stylish.,"Psycho is a very special film.

Anthony Perkins gives a terrific performances as the proprietor of the Bates Motel.

The story is superb and is genuinely creepy and scary. Such a well executed tone and feeling of suspense throughout.

The film is filled with so much iconic imagery, as well as the iconic score. As you'd expect the direction from Hitchcock is flawless.

It really is a masterpiece and deserves its reputation as a great and timeless piece of cinema.

29 April 2010,I can handle a sick old woman!,"50 years ago, Alfred Hitchcock released Psycho. Girl is having an affair with this guy, she runs away with $40,000 that she was supposed to bank for her employer. On the road heading for California to be with her lover, scared, guilt ridden and exhausted, she pulls into the secluded Bates Motel for a night of rest. There she meets the affable Norman Bates, girl takes shower and cinema got a jolt to the system.

What can you say about Psycho that hasn't been said before? Well nothing in truth, it's been dissected and discussed by all and sundry since its release in 1960. From critics to film makers and from the man in the street to the King Of Siam (probably), Psycho is known and largely admired by most in this day and age. However, the initial reaction to it on release was mixed, the words ""gimmick movie"" were even used in some quarters, while in others it was labelled as a stain on the great director's career. Made for roughly around $800,000 in just 30 days, and using his basic crew from his TV show, Hitchcock adapts the Robert Bloch pulp novel with cold hearted glee. Manipulating the audience as he lays out his American Nightmare, Hitch deals in fluid camera movements, jolting shock tactics, the ""mother"" of all twists and garners two incredible performances from Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the process. Not only that but he's also got Saul Bass helping on the visuals and Bernard Herrmann providing a terrifying stab string score that has long since gone down in the annals of greatness.

The proof is in the pudding, that the film is still today, 50 years on, regarded as belonging to the upper echelons of classic cinema, is its lasting legacy. An original and genre bending piece of genius film making from a master of his craft. If you haven't seen it then you should do so at your earliest opportunity, and one can only hope that the surprises the film has in store have by some miracle not been spoiled for you thus far. 10/10",10
11 November 2007,A boy's best friend is his mother.,"Lock your bathroom doors when you take a shower. This chilling horror classic by the master of horror, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, is probably his finest film. The cast is stellar featuring the unforgettable Janet Leigh in her Oscar nominated role as Marion Crane who steals 40 thousand dollars and takes to the road. She ends up at the Bates Motel operated by Norman Bates played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins. The rest of the cast is first rate like the wonderful Vera Miles as Lila Crane, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam as the private investigator. I believe the actor who Sam, Marion's cash-strapped lover, is also quite good in the role. Frank Albertson and Lurene Tuttle and Pat Hitchcock also round out a supporting cast. I won't spoil the plot but the classic should not be tampered with as it is simply one of the best thrillers ever made.

4 September 2007,a brilliant puzzle game,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine.

12 October 1998,The greatest achievement in film history.,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is the best film ever made. I have just seen it two months ago and I was astonished. All my life, I've heard how great this film is and I hate seeing films after a lot of hype but there are those few occasions. If you haven't seen this wonderful film, watch it in widescreen before the re-make coming in December. I can't wait for the re-make because I love all the actors in the film.

28 December 1999,This movie is the greatest!!!,"I love this movie! I've literally watched it hundreds of times, and every time I notice something new. Tony Perkins gives his best performance as Norman Bates. All of the other performers do a great job as well. This is my absolute favorite movie. It still has the ability to shock people today, which is a testament to its power. The shower scene is one of the most effective murder scenes I have seen, all without actually showing the knife penetrating the skin. That just goes to show that today's slasher movies are going about scaring people the wrong way.This is a movie that is impossible to become bored with, no matter how many times you have watched it. This is Alfred Hitchcock's best film.

26 December 1999,Brilliant,"I just got this film for Christmas.Since it is black and white I thought I wouldn't be interested. How wrong I was. From the start of the film,it grabs you by the throat and drags you into the world of Norman Bates.Although the 'shower scene'has been spoofed in so many other films,seeing it for the first time is truely tense. Don't watch the remake,watch this,and read the book.

20 March 2006,One of Hitchcock's best movies.,"Psycho is one of the best classics you'll ever see.

It's directed by the Master of Suspense himself, Hitchcock.

Psycho is about a woman who has stolen some money and kept driving till she got to a small motel, the ""Bates Motel"".

There she met Norman the owner of the place. Norman is what you would call a momma's boy cause he still lives with his mother who lives in an large old house on the hill behind the motel.

You don't get to see the mother yet. And you'll find out why later.

But when the woman who check into the motel starts taking a shower, you're about see some twisted stuff.

8 April 2021,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...

Alfred Hitchcock has had so many good movies, that I'd be hard pressed to identify one as his masterpiece. But, if I had to choose one, ""Psycho"" would probably have to be it. This is quintessential Hitchcock - without a doubt. I was born 8 years after this film came out, so I didn't have my first experience with ""Psycho"" until much later. Even though it was an older film by then, and it was in black & white, I can tell you that I was afraid to take a shower after I'd seen it!

Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real estate secretary, is tempted to run away and start a new life with her secret lover, Sam Loomis, when $40,000 practically lands in her lap. She succumbs to her temptation, packs her bag, and hits the road. But when a heavy downpour of rain forces her to pull over for the night, she finds herself off the main road and at Bates Motel, a forgotten corner of the world. Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the motel's owner, befriends her and they share a dinner together in which she learns of his invalid mother, and his frustration of living with her. It causes her to reflect on her own situation. She makes the decision to return the money, but a little too late as it turns out leading to one of the most suspenseful stories ever told.

For the fan of thriller/horror films, this one is a must see. In fact, it is a must own. Everything that made Hitchcock stand out above the rest is present here - his camera work, chilling musical score, strong characters, and a deep plot with an ending you didn't see coming. This is truly a classic that has aged well, and that has spawned three good sequels, and a remake. Norman Bates and his motel have become a cultural icons and have influenced countless writers and filmmakers over the years. This is the cream of the crop.

I saw a reviewer in here rate this movie at 1 star. Really? 1 star? You need to have your head examined. I own this movie and all the sequels and have watched them numerous times over the years. I never tire of watching it, and I never will. This gets the highest possible recommend at a perfect 10 stars out of 10.",10
24 November 1999,Best black and white horror ever,"I watched this movie because it was Hitchcocks anniversary and it was one of those films I'd been dying to see and I thought it was great {I didn't think it was as good as a lot of people had told me though}. The twist about mother was cool, second best in history next to the Sixth Sense. I thought 2 and 3 were cool too. Anthony Perkins was really good as Norman Bates.

15 February 2022,Spectacular,"The way this movie tells the story is very unique and impressive.

The story has a very complete development, each situation is essential for the outcome, the development of the characters is also very good as they react in a certain way in unusual or spontaneous situations. You never expect that plot twist or denouement, the excellent writing makes everything unique and original, and works as an influence for an entire film genre. The tremendous performances make everything feel very real and professional, as do the cinematography, sound, and impeccable direction that convey all the mystery that is in the story.

It is an almost perfect film that influences an entire cinematographic genre and, despite some bloody scenes that do not look very real today, is an entertaining and deep film that deals with mental disorders and that has a good development of the story, making it a reference for the mystery and thriller cinema that is made today.",9
11 August 1998,Greatest horror movie of all time!,"Psycho is just unbelievable! The dialogue, the camera work, the suspense, the music! Everything! Just seeing how disturbed Norman Bates is, is a very creepy thing. Hitchcock filmed this without one imperfection. He used a lot of mirrors in Psycho, and I personally think the scariest scene in the entire movie is where Marion's sister goes up to ""Mrs. Bates"" room, and she thinks she sees someone behind her, and turns around, but its just herself in the mirror. Another very interesting thing about Psycho was all the bird references. Marion's last name is ""Crane"" Norman even says to her ""You eat like a bird"" and Norman's office is filled with stuffed birds. Psycho's shower scene is by far the most suspenseful moment in the history of film. I think so anyway! To finish this up, I'd just like to say that Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a classic, and no one should be remaking it!!! !!

20 February 2000,"Timing, Hitchcock made it special.","In reading the comments of some, I think that to have seen Hitchcock's Psycho when it opened in '60, is to fully understand its impact today. It was a masterpiece then and remains a masterpiece today. Superior direction and camera work, and as one person commented, the film was released at a time when [psychological] monsters in the form of the ""boy next door,"" was not explored in films. Yes, Psycho started slow by today's standards, but the style back then was to move from the pleasant familiar to the darkest of horrors. Hitchcock understood how to create atmosphere and mood. His shower scene, while some today wonder what the hoopla is all about, set a standard of horror in an ordinary setting. How many films have copied this scene? I remember as a kid, fearing showers and hotels after seeing this flick. Hitchcock reportedly said that it was a good thing he didn't place Crane on the toilet (sic), or people would have a phobia about toilets. Ironically, in Psycho 3 (?), a character was killed while on the toilet. The remake of two years ago sucked--big time. Hitchcock's Psycho not only had the master at the helm, but it was also a matter of timing in cinema history. Those elements cannot be duplicated.

4 March 2009,The Ultimate Psycho,"Been meaning to watch this reputed 'masterpiece' for years and finally I got hold of it. Is it as good as everyone says? The thing is, nothing can describe the experience. Even though I have watched almost countless psychological thrillers over the years, nothing really compares to 'Psycho'. One would have to experience the film in order to find out the answer to the aforementioned question. Luckily, I haven't watched the remake which is said to be a scene by scene copy.

An atmosphere of darkness is set right from the beginning where one witnesses Sam and Marion who have just made love in a hotel room. Nothing particularly happens in that scene but there seems to be a lingering doom that will follow one of the characters soon. The black and white seems to work towards the film's benefit and stress on the chilling atmosphere. The closeup shots are especially effective. For example, notice the policeman wearing the sunglasses looking as though wearing a cold unsympathetic expression that creeps out Marion.

All the actors do a great job in that department. John Gavin is quite dashing as Sam Loomis. Janet Leigh is sensual and sophisticated. Vera Miles is terrific as Marion's concerned sister. Martin Balsam too leaves a mark and Anthony Perkins immortalizes Norman Bates.

The dialogues are clever and the editing is sharp. The twists are great as they 'make sense' with the story. Although I saw the ending coming, it fits well with everything. Hitchcock's film is very much an atmospheric piece and he has succeeded greatly in drawing the desired response from the viewer (even by forbidding cinema halls to not allow customers who arrived late). The sense of chill looms over, especially after viewing the final scene.",
6 July 2006,She couldn't even hurt a fly,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
23 April 2020,It's a shame the twists are now so well-known,"A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and while on the run encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.

This is probably Hitchcock's most famous movie- memorable for being creepy as hell, shot in black and white long after colour films became the norm, one notoriously violent sequence, and two great plot twists that you probably know by now because they've been referenced so many times. Watching Psycho without knowing anything about it would probably be one of the most amazing cinematic experiences ever, so in a way it's kind of a pity that certain scenes have become so iconic and so well-known. Check this film out anyway, regardless of whether or not you know the twists. The suspense isn't constant, and the films' two very distinct halves don't necessarily gel together well, but this is still must-see cinema, and also one of Hitchcock's best. 8/10

8 January 2005,My brief review of the film,"One of the most influential films of all time, this is also arguably the best directed film of all time. Hitchcock brought a number of new techniques out in this film, and many clichés of the thriller genre originate from what was original when this was first released. The amazingly discreet shower scene is one of the best-filmed sequences of all time, put against the chilling music score by Bernard Hermann that haunts the whole film. The acting is also top-notch, especially from Anthony Perkins, who has never had a better role, and most importantly, it is a film that is thoroughly entertaining, even after multiple viewings.

7 March 2017,"""A boy's best friend is his mother.""","PSYCHO is a psychological thriller with elements of horror in which tension is gradually giving way to a sort of creeps. It is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch.

During a lunchtime in Phoenix, a real estate secretary discusses with her boyfriend how they cannot afford to get married because of his debts. Forty thousand dollars in cash accidentally come into her hands. This is a great temptation for a young and unhappy woman. Her boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank. She instinctively takes the money and plans an escape to a new life. California is a famous destination of most of the fugitives. She has, because of the strong cuff, decided to spend the night in a small motel. A pleasant dinner with an attentive owner of the motel will be the last in her life...

The story is very tense and shocking. It has offered some of iconic climax in the genre. Mr. Hitchcock did not give up from a classical narrative. He has managed, regardless of the situation and the probability to transfer tensions from one character to another. Hitch has paid attention to small details. The secret of the main plot lies in these details.

A ghostly atmosphere has completely corresponded with violence, deviant behavior and sexuality. The soundtrack is excellent. All the protagonists are changing throughout the film. It is a kind of trap by Mr. Hitchcock. Compassion and understanding toward one of the antagonists in the film are certainly possible. However, a viewer loses a firm stance with regard to any kind of identification with the main antagonist. We hear a voice of the killer, we know some of his features, we are witnesses of his murder, but we do not see a clear character.

Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates has offered an excellent and intriguing performance. The duality in his character has reflected through a family melodrama, violence by parents and a psychotic obsession. His unpredictability and alienation can cause a fear and admiration at the same time.

Janet Leigh as Marion Crane is quite convincing in the role of an insecure and nervous woman.

Both characters are in strong conflict with themselves. Norman has struggled with obsession and fear. Marion has tried to overcome her own passion and discomfort. He is completely disturbed person, who can not make decisions alone. She is an unfortunate woman who tries to escape from everyday life.

The film has become unique in the combination of a sophisticated music and upcoming murder scene. Hitch has, in an intriguing way, played with the human psyche.",10

16 July 2021,Go take a shower!,"Hitchcock's greatest film and, arguably, the most highly regarded horror movie of all time. Janet Leigh's initial appearance, in her bra and slip, was as risque as any mainstream movie could be in 1960. The immorality of Leigh's character is established right off the bat. Well, maybe. Depends on your point of view. The legendary shower scene was brilliant. The ""illusion"" of nudity is all there was. Janet Leigh was very sexy in the two ""bra and slip"" scenes. However, Vera Miles, in my opinion, was even more sexy-and she never even removes her coat! I guess it's the way a woman comes across. As to Anthony Perkins' performance-he was made for the role. I've never thought the ""twist"" ending was so hard to see coming. Only the genius of Hitchcock could have made everything tie together so well. I rate this film the second best horror movie of all time. My choice for number one came about 14 years later, and was based in Texas.

29 February 2020,One of the great films,"Alfred Hitchcock is a filmmaker with a wide resume of great films, but Psycho is unique and brilliant. Hitchcock's style is the key here and if you're a film buff and enjoy camera work, this is the film for you. Great storyline and impressive setups pay off in a big way. The film is creep and allows Hitchcock to create a film that is one of the greatest ever made.

25 October 2014,Geeky Randy's summary,"Ahead of its time for its content, unconventional story structure, false protagonist and the presence of a toilet, Hitchcock's genius direction and Herrmann's chilling score is still gripping as many people today as it did in 1960. Janet Leigh is graciously brilliant in her role as an ordinary woman who is suddenly on the run for making a spur-of-the-moment snatch of $40,000 ($318,875.14 when adjusted for inflation), and Anthony Perkins is without a doubt equally memorable as the underwhelming, well-mannered, codependent manager of the Bates Motel. One has a fair argument at accusing the final sequence of telling-not-showing, but why pry at it when every scene before it meets the definition of perfection?

21 September 1999,Spellbound by Hitch,"Only a sinister organization such as the Academy would bypass Alfred Hitchcock as Best Director in 1960. Psycho is a masterpiece and Hitch will be remembered for centuries regarding his classic portrayal of a young Norman Bates, his run-down motel, and the mysterious relationship and death of his Mother. From Sam Loomis, Marion and Lila Crane, Detective Arbogast, Mr. Lowry, and even the used car salesman, Psycho is filled with astonishing characters, suspenseful plot twists, and a climax that would make every child in America think twice before entering the basement.

Alfred Hitchcock was an American icon and Psycho is a true reflection of his genius. To his day, Psycho remains one of best films of its genre. Further, Hitchcock's talent has stood the test of time, ultimately earning him the most honorable surname ""The Master of Suspense"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
14 June 2005,Hitchcock's most famous film,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

27 December 2021,"Iconic, Should be higher than 38 on here.","Alfred Hitchcock is known for Psycho, we all know that, but there is a reason for it, the way it was shot, the script, the shower scene violin music (which by the way I use for when my family calls ) but most importantly because of its change to the whole cinema industry due to its tension and the fact that it shows that a horror doesn't have to be the slash and gore films that had come out before it.

There is a reason this film has stood the test of time seeing as it came out over 60 years ago and it is still considered one of all time greats.

16 September 2000,Interesting and Scary,"I do not enjoy seeing black and white movie, by chance my cable tv shown this movie couple of years ago then i decided to watch it.

I do not really know what this movie is all about until i see the part where Bates talking to his mother and i assumed the person is really his mother. A rather strange and make me guessing as the shower scene come out and the famous tune ""ing ing ing ing, deng deng..."" It makes glue to my sit and watch the entire movie instead.

At the end of the movie, i then realised the mother is already dead and Norman Bates is considered as a person with psychiatric problem who impersonated his mother. It is really shocking and make me feel this movie is a must see thriller.

Then the remake appeared and of course the audience will know what happen. The difference? colour,sound. The old movie is much more glim and dull with mono sound.

12 June 2018,One of the classics...,"""Psycho"" is a true classic, which I doubt anyone would really argue against.

It has a good story and an equally great presentation of the storyline on the screen.

The movie has a good cast to perform the various roles and characters throughout the movie. And I will say that Anthony Perkins is just amazing in the role of Norman Bates, and he alone truly made Norman Bates immortal.

""Psycho"" is adequately paced, because director Alfred Hitchcock truly was good at building up suspense and letting scenes lead up to interesting climaxes.

While ""Psycho"" is not your average slasher movie with high body counts and gore in abundance, it has the right amount of suspense and thrills to make a proper movie. If you haven't already seen this classic horror movie, then you definitely should take the time to do so.",6
3 September 2000,Greatness,"What more can be said about this, but it was Hitchcock at his very best. It made Anthony Perkins and Norman Bates both household names. Hitchcock changed the face of film making forever and no director will ever surpass his genius. Absolutely fantastic!!

6 June 2000,Owes much of its quality to Bernard Herrmann's score.,"Ofcourse Hitchcock is a great director. But try watching this movie without Bernard Herrmann's score and it will lose almost everything about it. Hitchcock wanted to shoot the shower sequence (most memorable but over-exagerated scene) without any music. Big mistake. Mr. Herrmann thought so too. And now it has become a masterpiece. Talking about the shower scene being over rated; my favorite scene in the film is where the lady is driving at night and it starts raining and she turns on the wipers and she keeps looking at the rear view mirror and then she finally ends up at the motel. That whole sequence is brilliant film making that owes much of its brilliance to Herrmann's score. You feel her anxiety because of her feeling of guilt for what she has done, and we as an audience have a feeling that there isn't something that pleasing awaiting her at the end of the road. How do we know that? Pay attention to how the fast pace of the string ensemble comes to an abrupt change with pizzicatos and low resonance bows, once we see the sign of the motel. And notice how the cue leads up to that part; pure genius at work here, ladies and gentleman. If it weren't for Herrmann's musical score, this film would be just an average movie.",9

4 February 2005,Best Horror movie of all Time,"Psycho is the one true horror film, it's better than other great horror movies like The Shining, Halloween, The Exorcist, and it's better than Hitchcock's classic The Birds. This is the movie with the shower/murder scene that is possibly the most referenced scene in movie history. Everything about that scene is classic, from the camera angles, to the music, to the blood running into the sink(which was chocolate syrup since the movie was in black and white).

This is a very difficult film to write a review on. What I can say is take the advice given by Alfred Hitchcock at the showing of this movie when it was in the theater. His advice was to not even enter the movie if it had already started, because it can only be seen from the beginning. That is exactly how this movie is meant to be seen. Despite being in black and white, this movie is still a shocking experience. I think it should have been a crime to do what Hollywood did, they made a remake of this. When Hollywood does a remake of such a classic film like Psycho, then you know that they are very desperate to make money.

Everybody should see this, it is almost a perfect movie and is still shocking today.",10
29 May 2001,Thrilling & Masterful,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is so well known for inducing suspense and terror that it is easy to overlook what a great achievement it is in many other respects. It works so well as a thriller because everything fits together perfectly - the directing, acting, and music all help to turn a good story into a great movie.

The plot begins when ... But anyone reading these comments has either (a) seen ""Psycho"" already, perhaps several times, and thus knows everything that happens, or (b) has not yet seen it, in which case the less you know about the plot, the more you will enjoy it when you do see it. While this is a movie that you can thoroughly enjoy over and over, some of the surprises are especially good if you aren't sure what to expect. So this comment will avoid any plot details at all.

Although ""Psycho"" is usually remembered as a shocker, there is actually very little violence, and it is not especially graphic. Its effect is maximized by skillful build-up and by the atmosphere that Hitchcock so carefully created. The pacing is masterful, slowly building up the tension and only releasing it when it will have the maximum effect - that is why it creates such a sensation. The main settings - the Bates Motel and the Bates' old house - are perfectly designed to create an atmosphere full of possibilities. (Hitchcock also made a terrific trailer in which he took the viewer on a tour of the house and motel.) And it is not possible to say enough about the famous Bernard Herrmann score, which always fits the mood and action perfectly. The exciting music makes even the opening credits fun to watch.

The fine cast is led by Anthony Perkins, who is simply outstanding in a very challenging role. The movie would not have been quite the same without his underplayed but thoroughly memorable performance. Janet Leigh is also particularly good as the kind of complex, mysterious woman that she excelled at portraying.

All this together makes for one of the greatest of all movies, and a genuine must-see for any fan of quality cinema.",
7 September 2023,Truly a genius classic! A must watch!,"Ive heard many times that this is a must watch if you are into film. One of the Alfred Hitchcock classics they say. So i decided to finally give it a try.

You will early get to know that this is a film before its time and that its very well made.

Acting and manuscript is performed very well and its very well written.

Filming is amazing! Aswell with the fabulous soundtrack which really fits the story!

Editing and transitions is fantastic!

A true genius classic, a must watch and a very captivating film! A very well made film that revolutionised the raw psychological murder mystery horror forever! Good ending!

I really recommend it!",9
30 July 2022,First Timer,"I am starting a new journey of watching through the top 100 greatest films of all time (that I hadn't yet seen). I decided to kick start the process with ""Psycho.""

The cinematography is breathtaking and fully supports the twists, turns, and horror that has made the film so famous. I will be returning to this film again, but for the time being...10/10.

9 February 2005,One of the Best Films of All Time ***** out of 5,"This is film-making at it's absolute best.

Bernard Herrman's score is terrific and will stick in your head forever. Anthony Perkin's and Janet Leigh's performances seem truly genuine and real all the way through. The shower scene is undoubtedly the most memorable horror moment in film history. There's something about that scene that makes it hard to watch even to this day. Notice when 'Mother' opens the shower curtain how you can just barely make out the eyes that stare so coldly at Leigh before the knife comes down on her. And the brief moment where we see 'Mother' leave the bathroom. The entire scene is just masterful. It never gets old, never will. It will remain the definitive piece of film-making and will remain the granddaddy of all horror pictures.

On another note, Psycho II and III are actually worth watching, despite what some people may say. They aren't the masterpiece that the original is of course but the filmmakers wisely don't try to duplicate it. They are very different stories from the original. They are a (especially Part II) quite intelligent continuation of the character Norman Bates. If you are interested in seeing what happens to Norman in the years to come, they are indispensable.

As for the remake... I'm not sure it's worth mentioning. As a movie, it stinks because it's already been done, and it just proved that the original can't be beat. Then again, I've heard it should be just looked at as a tribute. But what raunchy way to pay tribute to the greatest horror film of all time.

So, in closing, let me say that if you haven't seen Hitchcock's masterpiece, go now and buy it. That's right, don't rent it, buy it. It's a certainty that you will love this film.",
22 January 2023,No Remake or Retelling Will Ever Compete With this Beast of a Film,"Alfred Hitchcock is a freaking genius. To this very day, Psycho is an utterly terrifying, highly enthralling and extremely suspenseful 1960s horror classic, and no, it's not just because of the iconic shower scene. It's one of those rare movie gems with strong tension and anxiety that manages to hit you or give you the chills every time you see it, but it's also a movie that gets better and better the more you watch it.

Janet Leigh shines seemingly as the film's central lead as a secretary who steals $40,000 in cash from her employer's client, before going on the run and ending up checking into an isolated motel run by Norman Bates. What really keeps you glued to the seat without a doubt is Hitchcock's fabulous work as a director. During the scenes unaccompanied by music or dialogue, his very clever camerawork alone creates breathtaking moments of horror-defining terror and uncertainty. In addition to this is the cast, with solid acting skills from everyone who has large portions of screen time, but Anthony Perkins definitely gives the best performance this film has to offer, in his unforgettable role as Norman Bates.

Another notable element that will strike the audience just as much as the performances and direction is the movie's excellent score, doubling the overall sense of dread and uncertainty in all the scenes that make use of soundtrack, which is composed admirably by Bernard Herrmann. The credit for the concept, ideas, scares and the terrific plot twist mostly belong to the novel by Robert Bloch, but it's hard to imagine that it could've been written or directed any better.

15 May 2000,a haunting film,"this film is a masterpiece of suspense, semi-horror, and most

of all romance. All three are haunting as they are placed through Hitchcock's outstanding touches and twists.In the first viewing by you, it will probably be a suspense thriller. The 2nd and 3rd viewings will put interesting questions in your mind like ""Will Marion go with Norman or Sam?"" or ""What ever happens to Norman later on?"" (of course two sequels were made to solve this one)but most of all this movie should be remembered for being based on probably the greatest murderer of our time named Ed Gein (who is even more psychopath than this movie describes him as). This film is the most haunting film I have seen, Halloween, Scream, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I Know What You Did Last Summer are all just a bunch of stupid bloody teen flicks. But this film is a piece of art.

19 May 2019,"""A boy's best friend is his mother.""","I will do my best to relate to you a good review of this film, while not giving away all the juicy details that make this film one of the best films ever made. All I can say is wow and Alfred Hitchcock shows us why he is one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live with this low-budget 1960 shocker.

The beautiful Janet Leigh (whose daughter happens to be Jamie Lee Curtis) plays Marion Crane who is dealing with a boyfriend (John Gavin) whose in need of cash and also the desire to marry this man. Crane is a real-estate secretary and a huge purchase is made in cash. Her job is to take the $40,000 to the bank on her way home. Thing is Marion decides to take the money and drive to her boyfriend in Fairvale. Before she gets there she decides to stop at the Bates Motel for the night. There she meets Norman Bates (amazingly played by Anthony Perkins) and this is where this truly great film gets even better.

Janet Leigh garnered an Oscar nomination for her role which she richly deserved as I thought she does an amazing job really in caring the first half an hour of the film as we follow her and only her. The fact that Anthony Perkins did not even receive an Oscar nomination for his multi-layered in-depth portrayal of Norman Bates is beyond mind-blowing to me.

The music as well by Bernard Hermann is truly one of the greatest not only in the history of horror, but of all-time films. It has been ripped off, attempted to be duplicated a number of times, but when you hear others be inspired by it you can tell exactly where the music is coming from.

Screenplay by Joseph Stefano from a novel (which I have read and did enjoy) by Robert Bloch. Also starring Vera Miles as Marion's sister Lila, Martin Balsam as Arbogast, Simon Oakland as Dr. Richman and look fast for Ted Knight right near the end of the film.

In my all-time list of greatest horror films this masterpiece stands only behind Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING in my mind. There is so much to look at and dissect and go over in your mind. Probably the most influential horror film of all time.

Followed by three sequels (all of which were never equal to the original), a TV movie, a yucky shot-for-shot remake and a TV show.",10
16 January 2005,Among the Most Influential Films of All Time,"This film has to rank as probably one of the most influential films ever made. It's one of those films that is referenced constantly. By the way, this is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the more powerful it is. In fact in the original advertising, Hitchcock asked viewers not to reveal the film's shocks to their friends afterwards, and also that viewers had to be seated from the beginning of the film (when ""Psycho"" was released people were in the habit of walking into movies at any point). As a result, i will try my best not to give too much away.

Based on a fairly good thriller by Robert Bloch, inspired by the life and crimes of real-life serial killer Ed Gein, this movie constantly unsettles the viewer. Hitchcock knew about suspense and he knew how to manipulate an audience which he does here brilliantly. Almost everything in this film is pitch perfect and the shocks are still striking. The actors, especially the brilliant Anthony Perkins, are all superb. Special note has to be taken of the famous score by Bernard Herrmann.

Whether or not you're a horror movie fan, this is a must-see.",10
16 January 2000,"Technical excellence, at its best.","Ever wonder what the movie history would be like, if the ""genius"" of Hitchcock, were never brought to silver screen? Aside from the story line, the cast, and the acting, the highest point of this film, to myself, is the camera direction. Being a past film and tv school grad', all I can say is, this one is a masterpiece. The angles and the way he let's the camera, lead or suggest to the viewer, the next scene,is alone, among the best direction of any movie. To see what Im saying, when next shown, turn the volume off, and just let the camera , under his direction, tell you the story. I believe one will get a different understanding of this film, and a greater appreciation of the director.

3 April 2020,Still a classic,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
8 October 2021,Masterpiece,"This movie is very well done, especially for the time, and though dated, it still lives up to all the hype. Very well done cinematogaphy, along with the soundtrack, very suspenseful and mysterious story. Great acting, interesting story and a great twist at the end. This is really an amazing movie. 9.5/10.

28 September 2022,Psycho Keep Getting Better,"I recently saw Psycho again for my first big screen theater experience of it and saw so many things that I'd never really noticed during my earlier viewings. There's just a lot more going on here than I'd realized. It's a very tightly and efficiently written and directed film that warrants multiple viewings. So much has been made of the shower scene and the final scene with the mother, and while those are climactic highlights, all of the in-between is very well done as well and often overlooked. I can only imagine the impact this film had during it's original release but for me, it still delivers.

29 January 2005,"pure timeless brilliance, this is more than a classic horror film","This film will never be outdated. It's a perfect example of the art of shocking and disturbing an audience without ever having to resort to graphic violence and gore. Excellent atmosphere, superbly talented actors, and a brilliantly demented storyline -- those easily add up to an entertaining movie night no matter how many times you have watched it in the past. You know all the lines, you know the ending, but you're still pulled in from the first second to the end credits every single time. It's a rare film that accomplishes this with such a massive audience.

This film deserved better sequels and it definitely didn't deserve the terrible late 1990s remake, but the merit in this first installment actually helps all of those to hold up better than they otherwise would.

Absolutely timeless, and SO much more than just a classic! :)

16 August 1999,"Well, a Hitchcock's fan's best friend is his ""Psycho"".","This is what great thrillers are all about. It's rather hard to tell a lot about this masterpiece without spoiling some of the surprises contained in it but I'll try my best to spoil as little as possible.

This is definitely Hitchcock's best picture and it's really great. For this movie, Hitchcock took many actors that were rather unknowns and made them movie stars by having perfectly directed them. Plus, the idea and the script are exceptional and don't have any flaws. And if that's not enough for you, just think of all the people that are afraid to take showers when they are all alone in their houses because of the traumatizing shower in the movie. Anthony Perkins is brilliant as the hermit called Norman Bates who lives alone with his ""mother"".

It's pure genius and keeps you guessing until the end. Martin Balsam and Janet Leigh are excellent as well in their supporting roles. A sequel was made but I recommend only the first one (Hitchcock didn't direct the second one anyway). You must see it.",10
8 April 2014,""" I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.""","Another favorite. I'm pretty sure this film is to blame for my early and unending love of thrillers and horror films (only the good ones though). As usual, the photography is my favorite part, as well as the editing, since both aid each other extremely well. I'm not even going to touch the shower scene, that's been analyzed to death (but I do love it). My favorite part of the photography is when she's asleep in the car, and the cop comes and talks to her through the window. The close ups in that scene are amazing. A+ acting too, perfect amount of tension. I also like when she's driving and all the bright lights are blinding her from the other side of the road. I'm so pleased they decided to film this is b&w.

There are a couple other things I'd like to mention too. First, this film totally flaunts the code, right from the opening scene. I normally wouldn't have noticed it as a casual viewer but bearing in mind film history, this is the beginning of the end of the code (finally!). Second, the score is absolutely brilliant. About 90% of my music collection is film scores and I've been a fan of Bernard Herrmann since realizing he did a great number of soundtracks for Hitchcock films (North by Northwest is great, and some non Hitchcock films like Mysterious Island are good too). But wow, the Psycho score is really quite amazing. It's so unobtrusive yet brilliantly sets the mood. And I'm not talking about the screeching strings, even though they're the most famous.",10

Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
23 December 2021,"""A man's best friend is his mother""","This was Alfred Hitchcock's last great film. If you also watch the eponymous biopic starring Anthony Hopkins, you will get some very interesting insights into the making of this film. I just watched ""Psycho"" again after many years, and this time I concentrated on Hitchcock's directorial skills, and I enjoyed the film just as much as I did when the first time I saw it in the early 1960's.

24 June 2023,12 rooms 12 vacancies,"When it's comes to Alfred Hitchcock Pyscho there's been much to been said about it there has also been that can not been said about it. That being it was a film of its time and ahead of time all around. It was the precursor to the Slasher as well the mind of the human mid. While seen as very tamed from a modern perspective it was very bold of its day. How it delved into the themes of brutal violence and sexuality adds to the scenery of suspense. The use of soundtrack and the shots of he stairs to the overlook of the Motel. The movie has a very eerie somber tone to it. Adding a sense of mystery and suspense. The cast give great performances of course Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates a lot of character to both of them and as you watch you begin how they both feel like prisoners running from their problems.

22 October 1998,A mind is a terrible thing to lose,"The psychological threads of the film are so complex as to be nearly inexhaustible; this feature alone contributes to its place in film history as one of the great celluloid efforts of all time. Like any genuine work of true genius, it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced film-goers to confront head-on just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche: the Oedipus/Elektra complexes, jealousy about sexual perceived sexual] rights, guilt, and self-hatred [as in Norman's cross-dresssing], to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot, ever, alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here, it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the $40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her [illicit] lover, Sam Loomis. The opening vista, a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix [note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name], is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads: the hunger for sex, for a safe haven, for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill, spiky score, which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred, one thinks, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly, the killer's ""cleansing"" ritual takes place in a swamp, the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean, dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally, I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room: Beethoven's Eroica Symphony [No. 3]. This majestic, noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's, but that jealousy, perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother, drove the boy to madness. Guilt, one of the human being's great purgatives, finds no outlet here, as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end. Hitchcock's use of mirrors works wonderful psychological tricks upon us, forcing us to wonder if what we see in our real and fancied mirrors, is real.",10
22 October 2019,Slasher Ground Zero,"The granddaddy of all slasher films Hitchcock's Psycho is film at it's highest peak. The story coils around you from the very beginning building your apprehension within the narrative until it suddenly shockingly turns on the viewer and subverts expectations in the smartest cinematic way possible. The fluidity of the storytelling is as good as it gets. This is the Yale of cinematic schooling. A masterpiece often copied but never equaled.

17 February 2000,8/10,"This movie didn't scare me one bit.

Not to say that it wasn't dramatic, nor enjoyable. It was very entertaining and the acting is quite good. It's a quality piece of work. So if you've got a few to spare (Paraguay currency), then go ahead and rent it. You might want to buy it even before seeing it.

Due to its lack of a scare factor, I gave it an 8/10. However it was an excellent film in other aspects.

RINGO STARR FOREVER

29 October 1999,"dark, chilling and full of suspense","I saw this movie for the first time in 1974 at age 16 and Anthony Perkins' chilling portrayal as mama's boy Norman Bates frightened me throughout the whole film. It also shed a new light on taking showers alone at home. Even today, in 1999 at age 41 I still get nervous when I hear strange noises while taking a shower.

8 June 1999,Tony Perkins at his creepy best,"Watch Psycho and you'll find yourself glued to Anthony Perkins very strange Norman Bates. He's a quiet lad, takes care of the hotel and his sick mother. A bit odd, but nice enough. Of course, we don't know what Norman's been up to in that old house. Perkins allows Norman Bates to get under your skin, and he stays there. He tricks you with politeness and sincerity, then his creepieness seeps in. Shot on a very small budget, with the crew from the Alfred Hitchcock Presents tv show, Psycho is the ultimate low budget horror flick. But what Hitchcock was able to do, it take horror out of the shadows, and shine light on it. The real shock in Psycho comes at the end, where Norman is sitting there in the holding room. Watch closely, and you'll see just how powerful ""Mother"" really is. Truly creepy.

13 August 2001,The Best Horror Movie Ever Made.,"This is, hands down, the best horror movie ever made. It it still praised to this day after 40 years. This movie has it all: good acting, good plot, great cinematography (the shower and staircase murders are outstandingly shot), a lot of suspense, the most memorable score in movie history, and a superb surprise ending (but since this movie is so popular, if you haven't seen it, you probably know the ending anyway).

Anthony Perkins is one the best villains ever, at least in the top 5. The house on the hill was hauntingly eerie, because you never knew what could be inside. This is the best horror movie to date, and it will probably never be beaten. Alfred Hitchcock is the best horror/suspense director ever, and one of the best directors ever.

If you haven't seen it, watch it! There's no real violence, at least not graphic violence (which is another high point, this film can still be incredibly convincing without resorting to unnecessary close-ups). Even if you know the end and haven't seen it, watch it anyway, it's worth it! 10/10

15 January 2007,THE horror film!,"Psycho is THE ultimate horror movie. What a brilliantly told story and equally powerful acting from all concerned. This movie details the aspects of shock and the macabre to chilling effect, and surely scared the wits out of cinema-goers back in 1960! Of course back then, a gruesome murder wasn't really seen on film before, not such a gruesome killing anyway, but it's highly common today. Hitchcock delivers a heart-stopping, gripping movie which doesn't let down for a single second. It's much better that the film was released in black and white; had it had been in colour, the fear and suspense may have been lost to some effect.

Janet Leigh portrayed Marion Crane with wonderful agility, but we all know the real star of the show was (and is) Anthony Perkins. Norman Bates is probably the most twisted and scariest characters in the history of film, and Perkins delivers the vulnerabilities we see in Bates to stunning effect. I have huge respect for Vera Miles, and she was also well cast as Marion's concerned sister, Lila. A very underrated actress.

The suspense to Psycho starts right from the word go, what with the extremely haunting music to the opening titles, which continues in certain scenes throughout the film. An equally powerful and shocking ending too...

Psycho is simply the ultimate horror movie, it hasn't been bettered, and cannot be bettered. The gruesome 'shower scene' featured not one violent shot - just illusion. But boy what illusion! Terrific, brilliant, excellent, superb, I can't go on enough!",10
20 August 1999,Psycho is a good thriller,"Said to be Alfred Hitchcock's most terrifying film and it sure is with its compelling story and stunning score. Marion has stolen a large amount of cash and is driving to meet her boyfriend Sam. She stops at a place called Bates Motel, which is run by Norman Bates and his apparent overprotective mother. ""She just goes a little mad sometimes"" according to Norman Bates in his conversion with Marion. This leads to the famous shower scene and the compelling events that follow when Marion's sister is trying to find out what had happened to her. The ending of this movie is shocking and surprising. This movie was number 18 on the AFI hundred greatest movies. This Alfred best movie even according to the public I would say so myself. I can watch this movie over and over again; I would still not be bored with it. 5/5 for this frightening classic. Followed by 3 sequels and a remake.

18 February 2007,A horror film that I actually admire,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more.

29 August 1999,Hitch's best,"Psycho is more than just one of the best films of all-time. It is the inspiration behind a great number of films since and will forever be THE ultimate in both plot twists and suspense. Who would have ever imagined killing off both the main character and what seemed like an interesting story only a third into the film? Well, Hitch did and even told the moviegoers at the time to show up for the beginning of the film or else miss the wonderful Janet Leigh.

Psycho has it all. A great story, well two as a matter of fact. One of the greatest scores by Bernard Herrmann (how many people don't know the skreetching violin and deep tuba sounds that really make the shower scene a classic?). The acting is superb with the chilling, almost-too-real portrayal of Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins and the running scared, almost-too-clued-out portrayal of Marion Crane by Janet Leigh. The supporting cast complete the film like few other casts do. Vera Miles makes the role of Crane's sister, honestly real and more than just a plot device.

This film succeeds in all aspects, including the ending which is often said to be overlong and unecessary. Without hearing the inner thoughts of Bates, however, would leave a gaping hole in the production. The double image of Bates face with his mother's scull remains chilling, even in today's glorified, Natural Born Killers-like ultraviolence. Hitch's direction and shot techniques are as innovative as those seen in some of his earlier films like Vertigo and North-by-Northwest. Next time you watch Psycho, slow down the shower scene just to see how many separate shots Hitch put together to make it so great. Quite calculated.

It's a shame that a film like Psycho had to have been marred by a few sequels and a terribly awful shot-by-shot remake. Unlike a continuing storyline like that of ""The Godfather"", this story should have ended here.

Full recommendation.

9/10 stars.",9
10 October 1999,Hitchcock's best film!,"Anthony Perkins is absolutely perfect as Norman Bates. He should have been at least nominated for Best Actor. Hitchcock keeps us on the edge of our seat, we never know what is coming next. The ""shower scene"" is definitely one of the most frightening scenes is motion pictures--because it was so unexpected. Highly recommended!!

The movie has a good soundtrack, beautiful shots, and it is very well done, with acting and movie overall. It also has a really good twist at the end as well. Very good and entertaining movie, especially for the 1960s.

6 February 2000,A True Classic.,"I feel that this movie is superior to Alfred Hitchcock's other films and that it, rather than ""Vertigo"", should be considered his masterpiece. Even though it was shot on a small budget, its suspense, thanks to Hitchcock's direction, Tomasini's flawless editing, and Bernard Herrmann's still holds up on multiple viewings. Also important to the film is solid acting from Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam and John L. Russell's constantly under-rated photography.

17 March 2020,Schizophrenic script,"The thrills embodied in this movie make people have to marvel at Hitchcock's grasp of the rhythm and plot of the film, even now few people can reach it. Each suspense point is unexpected, and cleverly, a representative thing will appear in each suspense point to intentionally mislead the audience. Hitchcock deliberately let the audience's eyes stare at the representative things, and in the meantime, constantly creating new waves, so although there is a lot less internal thinking, the audience still feels very exciting.

30 December 1998,Simply The Best!,"What more can be said about ""PSYCHO"",Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic that spawned an entire genre...the slasher film. To prove that this masterpiece truly stands the test of time,I recommended it to two of the 7th grade students that I teach (who have been subjected to the whole ""Halloween-Friday The 13th-Nightmare On Elm Street-Scream"" recycling bin)...and they loved it! The black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous,and the legendary musical score by Bernard Herrmann has never been matched (with John Carpenter's creepy ""Halloween"" score as a worthy runner-up). The 1998 remake is a pointless,cheap,waste of time (as it wastes the enormous,combined talents of Vince Vaughn,Anne Heche,Julianne Moore,William H.Macy,Philip Baker Hall and Robert Forster). As a movie buff and horror film addict,I cannot recommend ""PSYCHO"" enough...it is the definitive slasher film,and in my opinion,the best horror film ever! I'm not going to waste any time summarizing the now-familiar plot. Let's just say that no one twitched like the late,great Anthony Perkins,and the only actress to match Janet Leigh's shower scream is her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis of ""Halloween"" fame. **** A+ (10/10)",10
16 March 2000,"Very original, very clever, very good.","I just saw it in film studies class at university and i love it. Honestly, it really is a masterpiece. The direction is extremely original and credible and the adapted script is one of the most interesting, in that the main character within the movie fluctuates. I think this is a very interesting and clever idea which makes ""the shower scene"" more shocking. The music is also infinitely effective in creating atmosphere within the film. If you haven't seen this movie try not to find out too much about it - although I guess it's inevitable because it's a genuine classic. No matter what, you should enjoy it if you appreciate it for what it is.

8 June 2002,Definitive Hitchcock.,"The definitive film from Hitchcock's library that just does not age at all. It is probably more terrifying and disturbing now than it was over 40 years ago. Janet Leigh (Oscar-nominated) seems like an ordinary woman, but she has a few skeletons in her closet: she is having an affair with a married man and she takes it upon herself to take a large sum of money from the bank where she works. A frantic getaway is now the only option, but the weather impedes her progress. Maybe a stay in the Bates Motel is what she needs. Enter suspicious inn-keeper Anthony Perkins and his unseen elderly mother who torments him. Trouble awaits for Leigh now. Sister Vera Miles becomes worried after Leigh's disappearance and Leigh's boyfriend also joins the search (John Gavin). The search leads to the spooky Bates Motel and the suspense builds. Private investigator Martin Balsam also joins the search but no one's safety is assured. Hitchcock is in top-form here all the way. The film is tense and it wraps itself around the audience. Definitely trail-blazing and definitely a classic, ""Psycho"" is one of the cinema's best productions from any era. 5 stars out of 5.

19 July 2007,An intelligent thriller/horro,"As with most very old films, Psycho is unlikely to have the same impact on a modern audience than it had upon its first release. So those who are watching it expecting the 'masterpeice' they are often told it is, prepare to be disappointed. Having said that, if you take Psycho of its pedestal as 'one of the greatest films of all time' (though through a historical perspective and in terms of influence, the title is richly deserved' and watch it treat it for what it is, a psychological horror, than the film remains very enjoyable. The acting performance put on by Anthony Perkins is highly believable and at times chilling and, if you have not been exposed to the shows twists and ending already, they still have the potential to shock and surprise even the most seasoned horror fan. On the subject of horror fans, it is worth a watch on that merit alone or for any fan of cinema, to see the film that has shaped cinema today more than almost any other film

13 December 1998,One of Hitchcock's best films...a masterpiece!!! score: 9 (out of 10),"No one on Earth has captured the art of ""horror"" or ""suspense"" on film better than Alfred Hitchcock. His three best films that come to my mind are ""Vertigo"" (1958), ""North by Northwest"" (1959) and this one...his all-time greatest masterpiece, although some people think ""Lifeboat"" (1944) is his finest film to date. I can remember when I first saw this film...my friend's mother refused to let her son watch such a stupid, slasher film. I laughed. This is not a typical ""slasher"" film, but a story about embezzlement, greed, adultery, and murder...all of the ingredients that make up a Hitchcock movie. The ""Friday the 13th"" movies are what make up a typical ""slasher"" movie simply because there is no plot other than the constant ""slashing"" of people. This Hitchcock movie has a plot, of which I am not going to go into a lot of detail. After devising a scheme to embezzle her boss out of a chunk of money, Marion Crane winds up fleeing town, and her job, for her lover (John Gavin). During a terrible rain storm, she finds vacancy in the Bates Motel, which is run by the shy and innocent Norman Bates. What I found so interesting about this movie is the pace, the tone, the timing, the music, the house where Norman lives, and the confines of a simple motel room, and of course, the shower...all of which lead to murder and mayhem in a stylish, provocative manner. Roger Ebert's review of the movie is correct...at the end...the shrink's description of Norman is dull and overblown. If Hitch could have tightened that scene up just a bit...the film could have been totally flawless.",
21 February 2000,Shocking,"Psycho is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films ever made and is one of the few horror masterpieces in film history. That's the main-line, given stroke of it. But what it comes down to is that, really, seriously... it's Psycho - the one and only (that we acknowledge, screw off, Gus Van Sant). More than anything why it's Hitchcock's triumph as a commercial filmmaker - past the shower scene and the camera tricks and the notorious finale - is that it's (not so) secretly a monument to what we hide in all of us.

What I love about the movie seeing it again after so many years is seeing how in her own way Marion Crane is a bit of a psycho, just not quite at the level of 11 that Norman Bates is. There's an interesting parallel to make to how voice-over is used; Marion's imagination gets the better of her for a moment as she drives along and she makes up what the cop that pulls her over, her boss, her boyfriend, etc, all say. Watch as her face contorts into a little grin, almost against her better judgment, when she imagines the more twisted portion of the dialog. Frankly, I've had dialogs going in my head like that, imagining the worst that could happen from a mistake or bad deed, and almost taking pleasure in the more morbid aspects (I mean, hey, I directed Jealous Jerzy, what does that tell you? But I digress).

So keep that in mind when it comes time for the end of the movie - hell any portion really with Norman and ""Mother"". But mostly that last scene. After what is an amusing parody of exposition (the psychologist goes on for so long that it's the only logical explanation aside from dated, clunky writing - I prefer to think Hitchcock was smarter than that and was mocking what would or could be an exposition on Norman Bates + Mother and then just ""Mother""), Norman/Mother is in his/her room, and the camera closes in as the voice-over gets intense, plotting, paranoid, not wanting to swat a fly. Perhaps Hitchcock wants to draw the parallel, though there is a distinction: Marion imagines other people talking, while Norman isn't even in the equation: it IS Mother. Yeah.

Such great stuff. And if you haven't seen it before... what are you reading this for ya dummy!",10
31 October 2004,Are there still any vacancies at the Bates Motel?,"(Some Spoilers) Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror thriller about murder and madness at the deadly and infamous Bates Motel managed by the weird but seemingly harmless son of the motel owner Mrs. Bates Norman, Anthony Perkins.

The film ""Psycho"" starts out inside a darkened hotel room on a broiling Friday afternoon in December in the city of Phoenix Arizona. Marion Crane and Sam Loomis, Janet Leigh and John Gavin, have just finished off an afternoon quickie as they both get dressed to get back to their individual jobs after their lunch break. Depressed at having to meet and make love in the secrecy of a hotel room instead of at home like a married couple is getting both Marion and Sam very upset but they don't have the money to get married as well as raise a family. With Marion having a job as a secretary and Sam as a warehouse manager and also being very deeply in debt.

Marion later that afternoon is called into the office of her boss George Lowery, Vaughn Taylor, and given some $40,000.00 in cash from a client of his Tom Cassidy, Frank Albertson,to put away at the local bank for the weekend. It's then that something clicks in Marion's mind where she decides to steal the money and use it to skip town and later marry Sam.

Trading in her old car for a new one at a car dealership with $700.00 of the stolen cash Marion drives out west to California and as night falls it starts to rain very heavily and with the visibility next to zero she goes off the main highway on to a small country road that leads to the Bates Motel. Getting a room from Norman Bates at the motel Norman starts to become friendly and falls for the pretty sweet as well as obviously distressed Marion. This makes Norman's old and infirm mother Mrs.Bates very angry with him for not paying any attention towards her. Mrs. Bates also develops a very vicious and violent hatred towards Marion for what she thinks is her stealing Norman away from her.

Later in her motel room Marion has seconds thoughts about her taking the $40,000.00 and plans to return it the next day to her employer back in Phoenix after having a good nights sleep at the motel but the bitter and vengeful Mrs. Bates has other ideas. Horrific film that has you at the edge of your seat and by the end falling off it. With the murderous Mrs. Bates on a knife wielding rampage attacking and slashing Marion as she's taking a shower leaving her to bleed to death on the floor of the bathtub.

The shower scene is one of the most terrifying horror sequences ever put on film. The scene slowly builds itself up as the crazed Mrs. Bates enters Marion's room and creeps up to her in the shower. Quickly pulling the shower curtains apart Mrs. Bates lays into Marion with a large kitchen knife that had people in movie houses back them, 1960, choke on their popcorn and candy bars. Alfred Hitchcock set the scene up in a deliberately slow and deadly pace but when it exploded it left those watching, like poor Marion, in a state of first shock and then sheer terror.

Even more effective, but not as popular with the movie going public, is when Mrs. Bates confronts private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who was hired to find Marion,at the top of the stairs in the Bates house. All at once when you, and Det. Arbogast, never expected it Mrs. Bates lashes her knife into Det. Arbogast face cutting it open. As Det. Arbogast falls to the bottom of the staircase Mrs. Bates pounces on him, like a cat, and savagely finishes him off. This all happened so fast that you, like Arbogast, didn't even have enough time to anticipate it which made it that much more effective.

It later turns out that the insane Mrs. Bates had already murdered a number of people, before she murdered both Marion and Det. Arbogast, over the years and had them and their cars sunk in a nearby lake with the help of her willing son Norman to hide the evidence.

The shock to end all shocks comes near the end of the movie when Marion's sister Lila, Vera Miles, goes down to the basement of the Bates house and finds out just who and what Mrs. Bates really is and who was the real person behind the bloody and brutal murders at the Bates Motel.",9
21 February 2000,You'll be frightened every time you use a motel shower.,"This is one of the most stunning movies my eyes have ever gazed upon. Anthony Perkins was electric in his performance as a deranged motel owner. I feel the direction was quite magnificent. I was amazed every time the camara pointed up the path to view the house on the hill where Norman Bates lived. The suspense was immense, at the beginning where Janet Leigh is about to steal the money and then sees her boss when she's leaving town to what would be a terrifying death. Movies this good are very rare and if you don't own a copy then I advise you get one as you can watch it over and over again.

2 March 2001,My favorite film!!!,"Although it is extremely difficult to pick a single film as one's favorite, this would be my pick if I were forced to choose. No, it is not because it is the most shocking or original film ever made (as if there could be). In 40 years, the film has lost much of what made it revolutionary in 1960. It is simply a fantastic screenplay that keeps me on the edge of my seat at all times.

This is Hitchcock's best work as a director in my opinion. Though he rarely made a bad film, most of Hitch's films are commercially-directed. I think of North By Northwest, Suspicion, Notorious and The Man Who Knew Too Much as examples. Though each is a fantastic film, they are not terribly stimulating too watch and have minimal artistic merit. Psycho, by contrast, is a true work of art. No one could have expected it to be a hit at the time and was a great departure from Hitch's 1950s films. There are no Cary Grants or Jimmy Stewarts here. Just minor stars like Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam.

The two aspects of Psycho that set it apart are its cinematography and score. There are no panoramic views typical of great cinematographic works. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a B movie. One need only watch the famous shower scene to understand what I am talking about. It is perhaps the most breathtaking 2 minutes ever put to film. Hitch's close up shot of Marion's eye is still jolting today. Imagine watching the scene on the big screen in 1960! I guess what truly sets this film apart is the score. Perhaps no film is as tied to its score. Bernard Herrmann may be the best there ever was at his profession. His scores for Vertigo and Marnie are also top notch.

Just watch this film. If you've never seen it, it will provide a unique and surprising experience. If you've already seen it, watch it again and enjoy Hitch at his best! If you love Psycho as I do, check out Polanski's Repulsion, the French film Diabolique, and Hitch's first talkie Blackmail.",10
13 June 2023,Great Movie,"Rating: 9.1 Overall, a classic in the horror genre that lives up to the name as many iconic elements of the movie make Psycho a must watch for the slasher genre (especially considering how ahead of its time it was), even though it does have a good amount of filler elements.

Great Direction (was able to manage the use of different angles and scenes to help tell and move the story forward), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Anthony Perkins, Very Good from Janet Leigh, Good from the rest of the cast), Great Story that is filled with twists and turns, Very Good Screenplay (uses allusions and symbols to help keep the audience guessing the mystery; also, the dialogue was very fitting for the time), Great/Iconic Score that helps with building suspense, Great Cinematography (especially the use of multiple camera angles and techniques to give illusions of fear and movement), Very Good to Great Editing that helps with transitioning between scenes and camera angles, Plot Structure was good as all points were laid out at the perfect time in the movie; the resolution (while iconic) was a bit convoluted for no reason, Pacing for the most part was good (although there were a lot of filler shots that could be cut into a quarter of the time just to fill space (like Norman cleaning or Marion's sister walking up the stairs)), The build to the climax was very well done with the actual climax being the most suspenseful and best part of the movie, the character of Norman Bates is incredibly written as it shows the effects isolation and jealously can have on an individual to descend into madness (with Perkins capturing this essence very well through his mannerisms and acting); the elements of horror as not necessarily the focal point of the movie as the film after the first hour is more a constant suspense rather than murders.",9
28 July 1999,A horror masterpiece,"This is one of the most well-crafted horror film of all time. I can't say much about this film that hasn't already been said, so I'll just say it is eerie, suspenseful, and well-told. With this, Hitchcock became one of the best directors ever. 5/5 stars.

3 November 1998,My favorite movie...,"I think this is one of the best films ever made. It's a true classic. I have seen it over 20 times and I find something new in it every time I see it and it never gets boring. I'm really disappointed that they chose to remake it. But 50 years from now, people will remember the original and not the remake. A lot of people these days will be turned off by the movie because it's old and in black and white, but everyone should see. It's a technical marvel, Hitchcock was a wizard with the camera. There are also terrific performances by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. This movie basically started the whole slasher film genre that John Carpenter kick-started in 1978 with Halloween. In addition to being a great movie, it's also one of the most influential ever made. Look at films like Brian DePalmas's Dressed to Kill and Halloween if you don't believe me.

20 September 2019,How does this film only have an 8.5??,"A masterpiece in cinema if there ever was one.

There's not much I can say about this film that hasn't been said before amazing acting, fantastic story, and the music ahh just a pleasure to watch it all. I've seen this marvel of cinema many times and watched it again last night (19th Sept 2019) and it's stil got the magic.

It's amazing to think at the time that this film wasn't even nominated for best picture category at the oscars and now 59 years later its listed as IMDb's top rated films at number 40 has embedded itself in our worldwide pop culture has a metascore of 97, it's rated fresh on rotten tomatoes with a 96% with an audience score of 95%

These aren't all just lucky coincidences folks this film really is that good and better and if u haven't seen it what's stopping you.

Just don't take a shower after watching this film :)",10
1 January 2019,"""we all go a little mad sometimes""","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",7
26 October 2012,"""A boy's best friend is his Mother.""","Alfred Hitchcocks' ""Psycho"" still stands tall as one of the most riveting shockers ever made. At the time, it was an interesting experiment for the director, having been filmed on a low budget and in black & white. It introduced characters and scenes that became an enormous part of the popular culture and influenced a GREAT many films that followed.

Based on the novel by Robert Bloch (itself inspired by the exploits of real-life madman Ed Gein), it manages one of the absolute best twists in plot to be committed to film, making us believe it's about secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her impulsive theft of her boss' clients' money, only to jerk the rug out from under us in a now legendary ""shower sequence"". Marion makes the fateful decision of seeking shelter in the way-out-of-the-way Bates Motel, run by peculiar young man Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly wimpy person who's dominated by his shrewish Mother.

It's a testament to how powerful and endlessly entertaining ""Psycho"" is, that it can continue to enthrall us no matter how many times we see it. Hitchcocks' murder set pieces are the kind you never forget, and they're made all the more so by the most infamous (and imitated) of all of Bernard Herrmanns' music scores. It really helps to drive the movie forward, and Hitch and company create some truly delicious atmosphere, especially when it comes to *that* house, looking sinister and foreboding up on its hill. Screenwriter Joseph Stefano does impressive things with dialogue and a top notch cast memorably brings the characters to life. Perkins is just tremendous in the role of Norman, so tremendous that the role and performance would loom large for the rest of his life and career. Vera Miles is wonderfully feisty as Marions' sister, who'll stop at nothing to find her, while John Gavin makes for a stoic hero. Leigh is winning in the role of the larcenous Marion and her scenes with Perkins are superb. Great character players like Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Frank Albertson, John Anderson, Mort Mills, and Simon Oakland round out the cast, while Hitchs' daughter Pat plays the role of Caroline.

They all help to make watching this a rich experience, one that can look even better after repeat viewings, with elements (the bird imagery & references, for example) one might not fully appreciate on the first viewing. This is a movie milestone that everybody ought to see at least once.

Followed by three sequels, the TV movie 'Bates Motel', a remake, and the 'Bates Motel' TV series.

21 May 2022,The Scariest Script Ever Written,"This movie is one of the scarriest ever made, and for many reason. First, the very good acting made the characters be a part of the story, it made them fully invested in the story. Second, the dialog and the continuity of the scenes are extremly reallistic. Third, the layout of the environement where most of the events are happening is so extremly scary! Fourth, you can really feel the environement! You feel cold when its dark and raining, and if there is a character eating a sandwich, you feel like you are the one eating it! All those small details make this movie a masterpiece of acting, script, direction and camera work. This movie has also one of the best ending, and now i can see where this movie inspired a lot of the movies we see today. This an awsome masterpiece and it is scary has hell!

19 February 2005,Hitchcock has yet to disappoint me.,"I consider myself relatively new to Hitchcock's films. Before Psycho, it was The Birds and Vertigo. Vertigo got me hooked, so I decided to give the 1960 Psycho a day in court after seeing the 1998 remake. I now see why a remake was such an infamous move, at least remaking it word for word and scene for scene. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho stands rightfully so as one of the greatest horror/psychological flicks of all time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction as always is on point and the acting is wonderful, especially the Norman Bates character. A truly deranged individual. If you pay enough attention, you can piece together the ending before it actually happens, but even then it's still shocking based on Hitchcock's amazing shooting style. I give this a 10/10. A definite classic in my book.

We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
30 April 2021,"It goes without saying this a too well written, executed and delivered to not be a 10/10.","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

21 September 2015,For that time one of the best from Hitchcock.,"I watched Psycho again after so many years and it still remains a classic. Maybe youngsters from now won't think much about this movie in these modern ages. But I watched it again bearing in my mind how it was in the sixties. And you got to admit that for that time this thriller was really top notch. Even though I knew the whole storyline this time, and so the surprises are not working like they should be, it stills stays an enjoyable movie to watch. I remember the first time I watched it that I loved the twists in this movie. Anthony Perkins is perfect in his role and he will be remembered for this movie for ages. A masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock, a classic in his genre.

12 February 2001,"a classic, but hardly Hitch's best","The first time I saw this film I was quite disappointed. So much of it has become cliché in the four decades since its release, including the famous shower scene, Perkins' oedipal relationship with his mother, and even Bernard Herrmann's unsettling score. I had known the identity of Perkins' ""mother"" even before I saw the film and had to be told by a sibling that the audience was not supposed to be aware of this up to the last. It was like knowing the punch line in advance and not really getting the joke once it was actually told. It is, to be sure, a tribute to Hitchcock that this film has become so much a part of North American popular culture, but the downside is that the element of shock that so affected audiences back in 1960 is almost entirely lost on a later generation of viewers. One thus has to imagine what it would have been like to see it during its first run in the movie theatres.

Had I been there at its opening, I think I would still have judged this film to be inferior to the string of excellent Hitchcock offerings preceding it during the previous decadefrom ""Strangers on a Train"" to ""North by Northwest."" Why? So much of his previous work had relied on the use of suspense to draw the viewers into the plot. A good thriller builds this up carefully and deliberately until the final climax at or near the end of the film. Good suspense leaves much unstated and works its way subtly into the imagination. It's what you don't see that's the scariest. Think, for example, of the murder in ""Rear Window."" You hear a crash and a short, shrill scream followed by ominous silence, but you're not really sure what's happened until much later. Here, on the other hand, Hitch kills off his heroine brutally near the beginning of the film, leaving little if anything to the imagination, and largely putting aside the issues we had been misled to think the plot was building up to.

Moreover, despite Hitch's tongue-in-cheek claim that he had intended it as a comedy, there is little of the director's famous humour so much in evidence in the immediately preceding film, ""North by Northwest."" There is not much humour to be found in shock, while there is great humorous potential in suspense. He should have stuck with suspense and left shock to a lesser director.

I alluded to Herrmann's score. Without it, I think this would have been judged a far less effective film and less the classic it is generally reputed to be. Imagine Leigh driving along the highway without the composer's jittery music in the backgroundor, perhaps more accurately, the foreground. In such scenes it is the music that almost entirely creates the suspenseful atmosphere. Without it there is nothing of the sortjust Leigh driving and looking in her rear view mirror. Period. Not very scary.

Is it a classic then? It is, insofar as it influenced a whole generation of movie-goers and film makers who sought to imitate it. But on its own merits, I don't think so.",

16 November 2019,Masterpiece,"A masterpiece, and for my money, one of the greatest films of all time. From the moment Hitchcock tells us it's 2:43 pm and Janet Leigh's character skipped even eating her sandwich to spend three hours in carnal bliss with John Gavin's, to that penultimate shot on Anthony Perkins with a twisted smile on his face, it's quite simply one five star scene after another.

The tension never lets up, there is that extraordinary shift from one main character to another mid-film, and there is more than one misdirection that keeps the first-time viewer guessing. The voyeur scene, the abrupt killing of a main character, and the entire concept of the mental condition were all very original in 1960.

The cast is fantastic, from Perkins (who should have gotten an Oscar) and Janet Leigh (easily my favorite Hitchcock lead actress) all the way down to that cop who stops for Leigh and then later stares at her so perfectly from across the street while she's with the used car dealer.

There are so many other little moments of tension: Leigh's employer seeing her in her car when he thought she was going home, the car that doesn't sink into the swamp all that easily, and the searches into the ominous old house. There are also those big moments too, a couple of which need to be included in any discussion of the greatest scenes in film history. The other aspects of the film keep up too - the score is brilliant, and Hitchcock gets plenty of great shots, including the one from the underside of Perkins's face while his jaw twitches nervously and many others. It's hard to imagine a better executed film, and this is one that I never get tired of watching.",10
10 December 2007,I promise to use Tilex!!!,"We all know what is synonymous with this movie, the famous shower scene!! In addition to all of the macabre details that this film so brilliantly portrays, ""Psycho"" brought on an introductory revelation to the American movie viewer about schizophrenia!! If you have seen this movie, I am not sure if you remember seeing Alfred Hitchcock in it! One of the office scenes he was standing outside!! It is a fact that in all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies that he made a cameo appearance in each and every one of them!! This gave the movie a little bit of a mystique about the direction it was going in!! A director feels that he must have a gimmick to acquire a popularity with the movie audience!! The film ""Psycho"" evokes an eerie genre to the entire make-up of the movie!! Personal problems become a potpourri of predicaments with all of the major characters in the film, Remaining impervious to the thought patterns of a psychotic serial killer gives way to the potential of artistic creativity!! The complexity of emotions in this movie wound up captivating the American public!! Any enormously classic scene in a film, makes this film a masterpiece of the American cinema!! ""Psycho"" ""North By Northwest"" and ""The Birds"" all had classic scenes which endeared millions to these three Hitchcock films!! 1960 was a year for change in America on so many dimensional playing fields... Start with the fact that that was the year that I was born, I do not think that the world was quite ready for me!! I still have my doubts about that one actually!!! 1960 was the year ""Psycho"" made it's debut, and it is considered by virtually every movie expert to be one of the greatest films ever made!! I concur mostly due to the fact that many new concepts that this movie delved into were executed flawlessly!! A PERFECT TEN!!!!!",10

We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects.

3 August 2011,A Terrific Film!,"'Psycho' is a Terrific Film, in all respects. It's chilling, it's captivating & it's memorable. Directed by Maverick Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock, this 1960 classic, is indeed time-less!

'Psycho' depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, hiding at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner and manager, Norman Bates, played shockingly by Anthony Perkins, and the aftermath of their encounter.

Adapted from the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' begins with a bang, and ends with some haunted images. Norman Bates is a person, who is described as disturbed & neglected. In my opinion, Norman Bates is a person, who became the animal he was, because he lost his innocence too soon. He wanted to live, but when he thought he couldn't survive anymore, he took up violence to breath. It's a twisted personality, that shocks you & leaves you numb!

Joseph Stefano's Adpated Screenplay is nearly flawless. There is hardly a moment when the film loses it's momentum. Alfred Hitchcock's Direction is spell-binding. The master storyteller directs this psychological thriller, most convincingly. John L. Russell's Cinematography is chilling. Each Frame looks haunted. The Lens-Man has done a masterful job. Editing by George Tomasini, is superb! Art-Direction, is scary!

Performance-Wise: Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, shockingly. What Perkins achieves by playing Norman Bates, is nothing short of an embodiment. Perkins performs as if Norman Bates, was actually waiting for him to play him on celluloid. It's a Hall-Mark Performance, that is above any praise! Janet Leigh is fantastic. Vera Miles, John Gavin & Martin Balsam leave a mark, as well.

On the whole, 'Psycho' is much more than it's infamous shower scene. It's a film that leaves you haunted, with it's sheer power!",9
3 December 2013,The movie that defines horror.,"The only thing I remembered about this movie growing up was the famous shower scene, as it was the most disturbing and defining scene of terror I have seen at that time. I kept thinking to myself - that poor woman going through such pain and horror.

I didn't see the entire movie until I was an adult, and it was better than I have expected - superb and believable acting; a plot full of suspense, intrigue and excitement; eerie and very haunting music; a fast-paced story; and unforgettable tastes of drama and pure horror.

This movie is what I think is one of director Alfred Hitchcock's best work, a story about Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a Phoenix secretary who steals $40,000 from her employer's client so she could start a new life with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). While on the way to meet up with him, she checks into a remote motel run by the mysterious Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), whose life is apparently dominated by his mother's presence.

For a movie made in 1960, it has stood well the test of time. ""Psycho"" is a movie that relies on the on-screen drama, suspense and mystery of the characters (and of course the shower scene) for its scare factor - minus the over-the-top gore/violence, silly humor and sex scenes you would normally see in teenage slasher movies or Friday the 13th and Elm Street-type flicks. We are asked to understand the struggles and eerie life Norman Bates go through and the vulnerability of Marion Crane.

This movie appeared to be filmed with such ease and with the right amount of effort that it delivered an excellent motion picture - no overacting, no overdone effects, no over-the-top stuff - just the perfect balance for pure entertainment.

8 December 2021,Ahhh Norman Bates and the Bates Hotel,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
29 December 1999,A Classic in Every Sense of the Word,"To cinema lovers everywhere, Alfred Hitchcock was a god. And while he may not have created the heavens and the earth, he did create something possibly more amazing: Psycho. Hitchcock once said that he did not care about the acting so much as the technical elements of the film, but he pulled uniformly outstanding performances from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles. But, as many other reviewers have noted, it was not the actors that made Psycho one of the pinnacles of cinema; it was Hitch himself. His skillful use of lighting, effects, editing, and camera work have never been evidenced better than here. Hitchcock's magic was that he could take such a horrific story and make it so beautiful that you the viewer are entranced by it, not able to wrest yourself away for any reason. Psycho is the only movie I've ever seen that grows scarier each time I watch. The titles are a work of art in and of themselves, the photography is absolutely amazing, and Anthony Perkins's subtle, nuanced portrayal of Norman will almost have you rooting for him. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is truly a classic in every sense of the word, and in every sense of the film to which it can be applied.",10
22 August 2013,The best of Alfred Hitchcock...,"""Psycho"" considered the best movie which has directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and I think that's true. ""Psycho"" left by history and became very famous and it is famous until today.

Anthony Perkins interpretation is outstanding as Norman Bates a young man who manages a motel. Janet Leigh made an also great interpretation as Marion Crane a woman who stole $40,000 from the company which worked and run out to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin).

Alfred Hitchcock directs again a masterpiece but this time I think that he did his best with this movie. I think that ""Psycho"" is the best horror movie of all time and the best movie of Alfred Hitchcock.

13 December 1998,Truly the original horror movie of all times .,"Psycho , Alfred Hitchcock's classic about a guy and his mother is the movie that is at the origin of all horror movies ever made . It is truly an experience to live !!!!!!!!!!!!

The music has a great part in this movie .

Anthony Perkins is the ultimate psychopath ever !!! He and his ""mother "" are the best killer duo ever produced.

The new version is good but not quite as great as the original.

Still I urge all movie lovers to see it , whether it's the original or the new version , GO SEE THIS ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE!!!

21 February 2000,"Great performances, direction, score, a worthy classic","I watched this one last night for a third time. As always with Hitchcock's movies, this one looks better with every time. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? The direction is amazing (and very much ahead of its time), Bernard Herman's score is possibly the best piece of music written for a motion picture, a true work of art(and it's a pity there is not a soundtrack album out) and of course Perkins' performance is totally out of this world. And forget about the famous (and too much copied) shower scene, or the detective's murder; the most horrifying scene is the one at the end where Norman Bates sits alone, thinking his mother's thoughts, and then gives to the camera THAT look- it has me scared sh**less every time I see it. A true masterpiece.

6 August 2020,Chilling,"This film is a masterpiece in psychological thrillers. The character of Norman Bates is portrayed perfectly and as the audience we always feel the tension of the protagonists. The directing is very careful with every shot having a meaning. This is the film I watched the most for my university studies and it gave me plenty to write about!

4 July 2021,"An important film not just as a watershed moment, but for its brutal and psychological approach to the thriller genre that endures to this day","When Marion Crane (Janey Leigh) sees an opportunity to steal $40,000 so she can free her boyfriend, Sam (John Gavin), of his debts so they can finally be married Marion takes the opportunity and rushes to California to meet him. Thoughts of paranoia, panic, and guilt haunt Marion as she travels the isolated interstate roads in a near constant state of tension and unease. When she's forced by bad weather to stop for the night at the isolated Bates Motel, she meets the manager, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a soft spoken, timid, but seemingly well meaning man who sets her up for the night unaware of the terror that awaits her at the hands of Norman's mother.

Released in 1960 to polarizing reviews but massive audience approval and huge box office, Psycho has become a pop culture touchstone with music, characters, story beats, and iconography routinely referenced, homage, and parodied. Based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch the books premise of creating sympathetic characters only to kill them off in situations that resembled Ed Gein spoke to Hitchcock who fought tooth and nail to get the film made against the wishes of executives who found the premise too lurid and tasteless. Using his TV crew from the TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents and banking more on his prestige than resources to draw names the film was nothing short of a miracle to get off the ground with resistance from both executives and censors who were irked by the film's brazen disregard for production code guidelines. The movie against the expectations of all Hitchcock's naysayers created a haunting psychological thriller with a sense of style and dread that uses limited resources to great effect.

With Psycho there's so many elements that come together it's hard to pick out just one, from Bernard Herrmann's iconic string heavy musical score that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats in states of tension that are the only respite from creeping terror, to the cinematography by John L. Russell that perfectly frames the shots from the most iconic to the seemingly inconsequential this is maximum effect with minimum resources. The flourishes are well done, but they'd be ultimately meaningless without a solid story to back them up. Hitchcock creates intriguing characters and atmosphere from the get go with desperate stakes motivating instigating actions and brining relatability to the characters so we care about what's going on. Anthony Perkins is the central point of Psycho in Norman Bates and his performance is pitch perfect with his mannerisms, delivery, and body language conveying a story in and of itself. From Norman's meek politeness, to his discomfort with his own sexuality, and hair trigger temper Perkins hits all the right notes to make Norman both tragic and threatening.

Psycho is an important film not just for pushing the boundaries of sex and violence but also in unconventional storytelling and audience misdirection. With a storyline that isn't afraid to yank the rug out from the audiences feet to scenes that are designed to make the audience uncomfortable, psycho understands how to get under its audience's skin and take them to the darkest recesses of humanity.",9
22 July 2007,"Good, but overrated and unintentionally funny","""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.

I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending.

The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.

The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.

Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.

And the ""shocking"" cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When ""Mother"" is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the ""Psycho music"" at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.

It's unreal to think ""Psycho"" was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?

And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, ""ok, I think we all get it now!"" You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, ""ok, does everyone understand now?""

Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.

""Psycho"" is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The ""Making of"" documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed. Janet Leigh is still very sharp though, and still looks great.",5

22 September 2021,Horror milestone.,"Psycho is without a doubt the greatest achievment in the horror/thriller genre.

What amazes me most about Psycho is Hitchcock's ability to make this movie so intense and frightening with just the skill of the actors and his amazing cinematography. No special effects, no jump-scares, just an outright brilliant director and cast. Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is one of the greatest performances ever and he makes Bates such a spooky and memorable character.

Many may think the most frightening in Psycho is the famous shower scene, but that ending scene where Norman Bates gives a smile to the camera is truly haunting and unforgettable.

Psycho has some of the best cinematography i've ever seen, the camera angles and cuts makes every scene extremely unique and interesting. The storytelling in Psycho is stunning, captivating and you become more and more curious and interested for each second because of Hitchcocks ability to build up the suspense.

Psycho is a true milestone in filmmaking and also the greatest horror movie ever made.

23 February 2008,Very good...but not Hitchcock's masterpiece,"Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) leaves town with money that isn't hers. She's driving to see her boyfriend (John Gavin) and run away with him. She stops overnight at the Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his cranky unseen mother...

I don't deny that this movie is masterfully done by Alfred Hitchcock--the direction here is incredible. The justly famous shower scene and the murder of Arbogast are still shocking. The music score by Bernard Herrmann fits the film perfectly too. It's all well-done...but I'm not crazy (sorry) about it. Maybe it's because of my first time seeing it. I saw it in third grade on late night TV. The shower scene was completely cut out as was the explanation at the end! I was totally lost. So I thought it was a stupid, pointless movie. It's neither of course but first impressions are hard to ignore.

This is one of Hitchcock's true horror films. It was made in black and white on a low budget with a crew taken from Hitchcock's TV show. Also most of the cast took a cut in pay just to work with him. No one thought this would work but it's now considered a classic. I like it a lot but I find some of the acting stiff (Vera Miles and John Gavin especially) and some boring sequences. Let's face it--we all know Norman is his mother so that sort of lessens the movie. Leigh is good in her role and Perkins is just incredible in his. He rightfully plays Bates as a shy awkward little boy--but you see the madness lurking inside him. A truly great performance that came far too soon for Perkins and (sadly) destroyed his career. It's worth seeing of course but I consider ""Rope"" or ""North by Northwest"" as being much better films. Ignore the stupid R rating this still carries--it would get a PG-13 today. Recommended.

11 August 2020,Hitchcock twists the knife into the audience,"This was one of Hitchcock's experiment films. After the lavish productions of Vertigo and North by Northwest, and while noting the financial success of smaller and cheaper B-movies, he decided that he wanted to make a movie for less than a million dollars. He hired a lot of the crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and largely unknown actors like Vera Miles (who had played Henry Fonda's wife in The Wrong Man) and Anthony Perkins. Another thing he did to minimize the cost of the film was negotiate a contract with Paramount to reduce his own fee for a percentage of the ticket sales. Thinking the movie wouldn't make much money, Paramount was happy to oblige and Hitchcock ended up making the 2016 equivalent of about $150 million.

The thing about this movie as a story is that it's almost an endless supply of red herrings from start until over-explained ending. Janet Leigh's character, the point of view character for the first forty-five minutes of the film, is a red herring. Norman's mother is a red herring. The idea that Norman buried another woman in his mother's grave is a red herring. The money is a red herring. It's not only the audience latching onto things that ultimately don't matter but characters as well as they circle around the problem but only come to the actual source in the movie's final moments. On paper, it feels like a movie that would annoy me rather than entertain me. It's just this side of lying to the audience, but Hitchcock maintains narrative discipline and integrity while playing with us so expertly that he gets away with it. It really is the best single example of what he said, ""Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.""

The thing about slashers is that the genre has completely devolved to the point where the kills are the only important thing and the characters getting killed don't really matter. They're just meat for the grinder. Well, there are only two deaths in Psycho and both are of characters that we actually spend time getting to know. The first is obviously Janet Leigh's Marion Crane. She doesn't even arrive at the Bates Motel for a full half hour. Instead we get her relationship to Sam Loomis, a divorcee who pays alimony and lives in the back of a hardware store, her dreams of running away with him where money isn't an issue, and her job situation where she suddenly gets $40,000 in cash handed to her to place in the company's safety deposit box. Without any dialogue to explain her actions, she simply goes home, packs up her bags (changes from a white bra to a black one) and drives away from Phoenix towards California where her boyfriend lives.

She drives, desperate to avoid detection, sleeping on the side of the road in her car, exchanging her car for another in California, and, in a rainstorm, stops at the hotel where she meets the proprietor, Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins as Bates is one of the key special ingredients to this film. From his innocent introduction to the sinister ending, he's complex and endlessly watchable. His first scene, from his greeting of Marion to wishing her goodnight after their small dinner in his parlor, is such a great moment. Despite his innocence, there's something off about him. He's too innocent for his age. He seems boyish instead of just nice, and then the conversation turns to his mother and a darkness comes out of him. This is the much better version of the first scene in Strangers on a Train. There, Bruno was far too aggressive too early for me to sell the ideas at play, but here, Norman Bates is such a disarming naïf for the first few minutes that his dark turn doesn't feel like it should send Marion screaming.

Marion decides that her actions were not worthwhile and that she should go back, figuring out how much she owes from the money she used on her trip out, and then she dies. What sets Psycho apart from most modern slashers is that incredible cruelty for Marion because we, the audience, end up on her side, happy that she's going to return back, and then she dies. We spent forty-five minutes getting to know her, watching her make a huge mistake, and then begin to turn around on that mistake before she was taken away. It's emotional investment that's required for us to feel the murder. If she had been on screen for five minutes before her death, there would have been no investment on the part of the audience, but we feel her death and when the investigation of her death picks up in the second major portion of the film, heading by Sam Loomis, Marion's sister Lila, and the private investigator Arbogast, we want the investigation to move forward.

And that's really important because of who the actual murderer is. This is where the red herrings play out really well. We're led to believe for most of the movie that Norman's mother is the killer as complex thoughts about Norman's innocence and loyalty to his mother play out. He becomes an accomplice, but his devotion to his mother who's so cruel to him is admirable at the same time. We end up kind of rooting for him, being on his side rather than Sam's when Sam comes to question Norman. It's so effective that as we see Norman in his final shot as his mother's voice speaks in voiceover, we still feel for Norman, lost in the blackhole of his mind to his mother's power over him. So, she ends up truly being the killer, but it's still Norman at the same time.

It's Hitchcock playing with the audience, twisting the knife into them about expectations, emotional investment, and denouements. He's playing the audience like a fiddle, and it works so incredibly well. It's experimental, cruel, and wildly effective. For a movie that seems to rely so much on a twist, it holds up remarkably well because Hitchcock knew that it was more than just a twist. It was a story that needed fully fleshed out characters.",10
28 November 2020,Definitely one of the best.,"Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.

The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.

I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.

It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be.",10

22 April 2023,Twelve rooms. Twelve vacancies. Twelve showers,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
26 November 1998,One of the greats,"This film is without doubt a classic. One of very few films to maintain any sort of mystery and suspense despite its ageing. Some films stand the test of time, and Psycho is brilliant. It freaked me out when I first saw it, despite everything: black and white, actors I'd never heard of, and my first Hitchcock experience. If you haven't seen it, you're either too scared or haven't had the opportunity, but either way, you're doing yourself a great disservice.

Even though horror films these days may have more immediate impact, my students have said that the film lingers long in the memory afterwards. It has made an impression on them and I think that that is the highest compliment that can be paid to this great film.

He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
22 November 2000,Greatest Film of all Time,"Films like Psycho should be remembered throughout history. A work of technical and psychological brilliance, I am stunned that someone could find this film boring and not frightening. This was undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made. Only Hitchcock could make this film a classic. With only two murders, it is infinitely scarier than any of these slasher films with a murder every two seconds. This movie was not about the murders, although that was what you were lead to believe by the first murder. This film was, for lack of a better term, a horrifying character study. This film will go down in history and be remembered forever for it. It should never have been remade, and one can only hope that perhaps someday they will re-release it into theaters.

2 May 2000,A touching tale of a young man & his mother,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

19 March 2022,"Psycho is literally a watershed, because, in fact, the viewer is treated to not one, but two very different films. A classic that consolidated several clichés of the genre","In terms of narrative, Psycho is literally a watershed, because, in fact, the viewer is treated to not one, but two very different films. The first one stars Janet Leigh, playing secretary Marion Crane. We see her, in a bra, in bed with her boyfriend in a risqué scene for the time that was hotly debated by censors still clinging to the Production Code. The two don't have the money to get married and Marion suddenly decides to steal $40,000 from her boss and flees Phoenix, Arizona, driving.

Hitchcock makes us follow Marion's escape in detail, approaching the character with an invasive camera, close to her face, in medium and close-up. We became the girl's accomplices and began to suffer for her, in a way sympathizing with her actions. Her saga continues when she is woken up by a police officer after spending the night sleeping in her car by the side of the road. Then she decides to get rid of the car and a restless buy and sell negotiation ensues, again with the cop lurking. Marion feels the world close in around her and we feel it with her. The journey continues and Marion, in the rain, deviates from the road and stops at a motel - yes, the Bates Motel - to spend the night, because, in addition to being tired and not seeing anything with the storm, she has doubts about the act. Committed and begins to rethink the theft. She is then taken care of by an attentive young man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who owns the motel, and who lives with his mother in a nearby house, who puts her in the first room, near the lobby. Marion then goes to take a shower. She seems to want to clean up the mess she's made. There is a subtext of regret, of the cleansing brought by the water.

And it's at this point that Hitchcock pulls our rug and presents the biggest plot twist of all time, with a lady - presumably Norman's jealous mother - mercilessly stabbing Marion to death in one of those sequences that, once seen, will never be forgotten, with Herrmann's soundtrack, loaded with strings and a lot, but a lot of tension (to the point that Herrmann's credits in the film immediately predate Hitchcock's!), despairing us. The audience at the time must have been bewildered by the surprise and completely confused by a simple fact that can be boiled down to a question: the protagonist died and now?

Aided by Joseph Stefano's great script, Hitchcock brilliantly breaks the narrative axis, shocking the viewer. A confusion settles in our minds at this time. What would the story be like now? The conventional structure of the films is broken, changing the entire focus of the narrative. John L. Russell's brilliant photography helps create an essential trick to the plot's suspense. Notice how, in the famous scene, the play of light and shadows hides the main features of Mrs. Bates' face and the revelation of her face only happens in the last act. In this way, we have the tip, but not the solution for the case. George Tomasini's excellent editing is also essential in building the suspense. The rapid switching of images further enhances the impact of the bathtub scene. His talent can also be seen in the final scene, which perfectly synchronizes the various parallel actions that culminate in the monumental scene in which the identity of the assassin is revealed.

Two other moments are essential for the viewer not to discover the plot solution ahead of time. The first is when Detective Arbogast sees Mrs Bates at the window of the house and is then approached by Norman Bates in front of the Hotel. The second happens when Sheriff Chambers (John McIntire) tells Sam and Lila (Vera Miles) that Mrs. Bates died ten years ago. In the next shot, we can see the door to Mrs. Bates and hear her and Norman talking. Next, we see Norman carrying his mother down to the basement. Despite never showing her face, Hicthcock practically nullifies in our minds the possibility that Norman and his mother are the same person. The director also creates visually interesting sequences, such as the dry cut from the drain plane to the dead Marion's eye plane. Through a tracking shot, he leaves the girl's eye, passes the money on the dresser and ends the scene with a distant shot of the house. This move is not done by accident. The director wants to show the whole crime scene, to set us up and remember everything that is involved in that murder.

Psycho was the film responsible for one of the most famous and well-known murder scenes in movie history, when the character Marion Crane is surprised by the psychopath in the bathroom, while taking a shower. Technically, this sequence generated a huge amount of work (especially considering the time of production), taking a week to make, with 70 camera positions for just 45 seconds of film. The montage of several small scenes together, in charge of the technician Saul Bass (also creator of the initial signs of the film) had a disturbing effect, resulting in the illusion of violent blows from the murderer's knife, and where we can clearly see that it does not penetrate the body. By actress Janet Leigh.

Another classic scene is also the murder of Detective Arbogast on the steps of the mansion where Norman Bates lived. Using a different technique, Hitchcock achieved an interesting effect by filming only the frightened and bloodied face of actor Martin Balsam, who was descending the stairs in a special chair, frantically waving his arms. In fact, the Gothic-looking house used by the production as a model for the construction of Bates' mansion actually exists, located in Kent, Ohio. The soundtrack, by Bernard Herrmann, is one of the best known and most consecrated in the history of horror and suspense cinema, especially in the part of the famous murder scene in the shower, with an impressive sequence of high-pitched and strident violins that they further intensified the atmosphere of tension and agony already existing between the murderer and his victim. The musician Herrmann was one of Hitchcock's great collaborators, forming a partnership with him responsible for nine films.

Hitchcock delivers a great suspenseful plot from the start. Marion's drive between the bank and the motel is a claustrophobic driving lesson (in a good way). The character is consumed with guilt from the moment she steals the money, which doesn't stop her from continuing her journey. However, at every moment she is stunned in her mind with the consequences of her criminal act, wondering what her boss, her sister and even her own boyfriend would say if they found out what she did. Panic increases even more when she is intercepted by a suspicious police officer who interrogates her on the road and afterwards, in a great clash between desire and guilt.

Janet Leigh's characterization should also take a closer look. If at the first moment we see her in intimate clothes, her clothing is white, as if portraying a certain purity of her character, after the robbery, she wears dark tones, which indicates her option for the ""bad path"", so to speak. Her redemption takes place at the motel, when she undresses fully, she rips up a compromising note and throws it in the toilet, as if to rid herself of her guilt. Naked, in the shower (fateful moment), with the shower squirting water on her face, it's the moment of total freedom. A freedom, however, that goes beyond death, explained by the horror of more than 70 frames in the montage of the stab wounds that end Marion's life.

Norman Bates' construction is impeccable. Perkins presents us with a performance full of layers, which deepen and bring us closer to his character in addition to convincing everyone between the lines in his way of acting or even in his expression. At no time do we doubt the overwhelming power that the character has, and we are peeling away his submissive personality to his mother, of someone capable of hiding a crime to protect those he loves. And, as we go along, we are introduced to one of the best plots in history, as we understand the picture as a whole, giving us another unforgettable moment of cinema. It is no wonder that the figure of Perkins was so linked to Norman, shocking us with the mastery of his performance added to a powerful rhythm that marked everyone.

Psycho would be the perfect murder thriller were it not for its ending. And I'm not talking here about solving the Marion murder plot. It does so flawlessly, with a round script, brilliant performances, precise direction and haunting soundtrack. I'm actually talking about the final three minutes in which Hitchcock doesn't shy away from presenting viewers with a detailed, but extremely artificial and ultimately unnecessary explanation of Norman Bates' insanity. He is trapped in a cell, but a forensic psychiatrist enters the sheriff's office and, speaking to Lila and Sam, explains everything the viewer already knows. Nothing is left for doubt or for discussion. Norman Bates is unveiled, laid bare in a version for dummies of all the sensational work that came immediately before.

Perhaps it was an extreme insecurity due to the fact that the director had invested his money in the production that had been left aside by Paramount and that even had its distribution sabotaged. But the fact is that the ending is there, unfortunately, an example of ""amateurism"" in a work that would otherwise be worthy of a standing ovation. I recognize that maybe this statement is an exaggeration, but notice how the whole sequence is completely at odds with what came before. There is relatively little dialogue in the film and all the explanation we need has already been precisely provided by Hitchcock in the sequences that take place inside Bates' ""haunted mansion"". Repetition tires and calls viewer's idiots almost literally.

Psycho is a timeless classic that, for better or worse, inspired (along with Rosemary's Baby) a series of films focused on horror and suspense and consolidated several clichés of the genre.",9
18 August 1999,Alfred Hitchcock's best...,"After all these years Alfred Hitchcock decided to make himself the master of horror. Psycho is the film that terrified the generation of '60.But the weird and spectacular thing about Psycho is that it can terrify as well our generation. When I first saw this film I could not have a shower for at least one week! I had the impression that Norman Bates could kill me at any moment. Sir Alfred Hitchcock is the master of horror!

28 April 2022,"Still One Of The Best Dark Thrillers, Even After 62 Years. Timeless. A Must Watch - 1-2-Own","Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Psycho; before launching into my critique, here's a breakdown of my ratings:

Story - 1.75 Direction - 1.75 Pace - 1.75 Acting - 1.75 Enjoyment - 1.75

TOTAL - 8.75 out of 10

Sixty-Two years old and still kicking arse. The funny thing is, when Gus Van Sant gave us the frame-by-frame remake in 1998, the senior Norman slaughtered the junior Norman. Therefore, Psycho even whips its own ass.

I loved the film so much when I originally watched it, that I hunted down the Robert Bloch novels. They are as worthy of a read as the movies are worth watching. Stefano does an admirable job of bringing the story to the screen. Some brilliant little touches work well to build the tension and show Marion's anxiety. These are exampled best in her car journey sequences. And it shows how good scenes can be when you have a good writer, an imaginative director, and a talented actress - A perfect synergy of skills - which also sums up the picture.

As I mentioned above, Hitchock is visionary and a very clever one, at that. Not only does he add creative scenes, such as the opening sequence as we pan across the city and zoom into one window where we find Marion and Sam in a cheap hotel room. It's a little choppy because of the mechanics of the shot and the equipment available. Today he would have made it look as smooth as the proverbial baby's botbot. And the same can be said for Arboghast's staircase fall. The clever bits come in the form of conventional scenes. Too much of a good thing is still too much. Hitchcock is a maestro; he knows when a segment needs extra pazazz and when to leave it alone. It creates a visual and emotional rollercoaster ride for the audience, which stays stimulating and captivating.

The cast is superb, and everyone gives their all. There are no small parts in Psycho, and I have to admit to liking all the characters, which is usually inconceivable in most films. Everyone is so perfectly fleshed out and realistic. There is only one Norman Bates, and that is Anthony Hopkins. For most of the movie, he comes across flawlessly as the shy and nervous motel manager. But in the last sequence, he sends a cold shiver straight down your spine and into your soul with a smile as insanely deadly and dangerous as The Joker's.

If you have not watched Psycho, I strongly suggest finding a copy and giving it a look-see. This film, along with Rope and The Birds, is the best Hitchcock created. In my book A Must See.

Please feel free to visit my Killer Thriller Chillers and The Game Is Afoot lists to see where I ranked Psycho.

27 April 2000,PSYCHO A true classic,"What a movie.PSYCHO is my all time favourite movie . Great performances from all the cast . I believe Anthony Perkins should have won an Oscar for his chilling performance as Norman Bates . Alfred Hitchcock's best film . I first saw this movie when I was just 10 years old . It was the first adult movie my parents would let me watch and I loved it . If you've not seen this movie you have missed a true classic . I would rate it 10++ .

John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
6 October 2019,Hitchcock delivers another triumph from a simple storyline,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue"").

26 February 2004,Hidden meanings,"I read a college professor's thesis on Psycho years ago. I found it interesting, and I think of several of their ideas every time I see the film. Some of the more interesting ideas follow:

1. It's Christmas time, and you see decorations when Marion is leaving town but the movie seems more like Halloween.

2. When Marion is changing her clothes in her bedroom, you see her shower head peeking out...foretelling things to come.

3. When she buys a newspaper, and folds the paper and puts it in her purse, the word ""OK"" is visible. This is particularly noticable when she is at the motel register.

4. Her license plate is ""NFB"" aka Norman F. Bates.

26 October 2005,"Exasperatingly detailed, steely-cold precursor to the 'slasher'...","Alfred Hitchcock has no sympathy for the victims in ""Psycho"", and he views them dispassionately. This relatively low-budget film is in silvery black-and-white, eerie and beautiful, with gliding camera-work and clever production touches which warrant repeat viewings, however it is much too merciless towards its characters to be a black comedy. It's also not much of a murder-mystery (we have an early idea of what's going on), yet the suspense in the third act is mounted with cunning precision. Mostly, Hitchcock seems curiously fascinated with plot-exposition and details, although the picture is still quite chilling. Anthony Perkins' tightly-controlled performance as Norman Bates is hypnotizing: his boyish good looks can be taken either way--gangly or crazily disconnected--and his eyes, which are frantic, dart around like an impatient child's (it's the role of a lifetime). I didn't much care for Simon Oakland's psychology report at the end, but the final shots and the voice-over are masterfully pulled-off. *** from ****

7 October 2021,Unbelievablely Great!,"I don't know how to explain this but this movie is by far the 'Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen'. I mean a movie that plays with your mind for almost 2 hours. Hitchcock is truly 'The Master of Suspense'. I can't believe this movie haven't won a single oscar that year.

Janet Leigh, John Gavin and Everyone else did great but the casting choice of Anthony Perkins was a genius idea. Anthony Perkins smashed it as Norman Bates and became 'One of the Scariest Villains who Ever graced the Cinema'. Alfred Hitchcock did the best in every aspect to make this movie, one of the Greatest.

A movie that transcends the limits of time and became Immortal for fans, critics and the upcoming film makers. No one can ever make a horror thriller ever close to its caliber.

Don't get fooled by its time of release. It is still the Best movie today.

29 June 2008,"""We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes...""","Psycho takes a lot of credit for starting the modern horror genre. Well, I must say that it deserves it. Before Psycho, censorship was extremely strict. Psycho broke a lot of rules in its day... not only did it go above and beyond with its famous murder sequences, but it also went above and beyond with smaller censorship rules. Psycho was the first American film where the audience could clearly see a flushing toilet in full frame. Psycho was also the first film to show a women walking around in her under-garments for an extended period of time. If Psycho had not come around, it could very well be possible that the idea of Jason stabbing a teenage couple having sex would have been frowned upon by the censorship boards. Psycho changed the way movies where made, which is what opened up the idea of the slasher film, and the horror genre in general.

There had been horror films before Psycho, but none broke all of the rules that Psycho had. All the rules that Psycho broke became rules that everyone broke. For this reason, there have been too many Psycho rip-offs to count. Scream, Friday the 13th, Saw, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, and even Black Christmas are all pure rip-offs of Psycho's success. This could very well be Psycho's only con, and it isn't even the film's fault. Now don't get me wrong, Halloween and Friday the 13th are good films, but if you are at all interested in horror/suspense, you have to view the movie that set new standards for the genre when it was released in 1960.

Today, in 2008, Psycho doesn't seem nearly as well done as it was when it was released. However, it is just as good as it used to be. The only reason it doesn't seem good is because of one thing... publicity. AFI, Youtube, Google... It's all the same. Surly everyone alive today has seen the shower scene somewhere, whether or not they have seen the movie. I had personally seen certain scenes before viewing the film itself, so a large amount of the impact was lost for me. Psycho still left a chill on my back, and worked very well. If you are one of the lucky few who haven't seen clips of Psyhco, I highly encourage that you do not search for any. Search out the movie itself.

As for the film itself, it is purely remarkable. The cast is extremely remarkable. Anthony Perkins is extremely amazing in his role as Norman Bates. Perkin's performance isn't only Oscar-Worthy, it is also one of the greatest performances of all time. It is up there with Anthony Hopkins' role as Hannibal Lector in my book. Janet Leight and Vera Miles are also very good actresses, and fit the role of heroine in Psycho very well. The acting in Psycho doesn't seem dated at all.

The suspense is also spectacular in Psycho. Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant directing and Bennard Herrman's chilling score work together to build up atmosphere and suspense for the film. This is done extremely well. Psycho may very well be one of the most suspenseful movies of all time. Another thing that helps with the amount of atmopshere of the movie is how real it looks and feels. Everything in this movie seems realistic to the viewer. You can relate to the people in the film, especially with the way the characters are developed.

Psycho may very well be the flawless movie. It has everything to not only make it a great horror film, but a great film as well. Any horror fan should check out Psycho, simply because it set so many new levels in the genre. Any film fan in general should check out Psycho is well, simply because it is so well made. Psycho is a must view for everyone.

A lot of the movies from the 50s and 60s seem very cheesy by today's standards of computer animation and slang talk. However, Psycho still fits in with the classics. This is because Alfred Hitchcock directed his movies for the audience, not for the critics. This is obviously why the critics responded terribly to it. There were very few positive reviews for Psycho by all of the huge film critics, yet it still ranks as the 21st greatest film ever made on the IMDb top list. Hitchcock was able to not only make this movie well, but he was also able to make it enjoyable.

Psycho still ranks in with the HORROR classics as well. Perhaps this is due the way it inspired so many films to come after it. This may also be due the fact that Psycho plays with all of the fears that thrilled audiences just as much today as it did in 1960; The thrill of running from the police; The fear of run-down motels; The fear of strangers; The feel of taking showers alone; and of course: The fear of our mother's rage.

22 April 2023,Hitchcock's masterpiece,"This is one of a very rare kind of movies that deserves all the hype surrounding it.

Due to the brilliant direction from Hitchcock this didn't even felt like a 60's movie, this could be brand new!

Anthony Perkins was just phenomenal, I normally dont think about how good an actor is while watching, but in this case I thought about that several times, so cant help but to bow to this performance!

The script is very well written and solid. The thriller is everywhere, from the beggining with scenes that dont really have much impact to the main plot, to the end where my heart was racing, and I was anxious trying to figure out how would this going to end.

There's really nothing more that you can ask for. Its a 10/10 in all points.",10
1 December 2001,Please be careful,"Robert Louis Stevenson's masterful novella ""The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde"" takes the form of a mystery: at the start we're told that Jekyll and Hyde share a secret, but it's a while before we find out what that secret is. These days, almost everyone already knows what the secret is, and NOT because they've read the story - rather, they've listened to some blabbermouth, who, BECAUSE ""everyone already knows"", feels himself licensed to spoil things for the few remaining people who don't. Well, that blabbermouth won't be me. And I'm not going to give away the surprises in ""Psycho"", either.

Nor should you, if you know what they are. This is a plea for people to be more circumspect with such information, even if such circumspection seems futile in the current climate.

P.S. Psycho is a great movie - possibly Hitchock's best, although there are four other contenders for that title. But this much everyone really DOES know already.

P.P.S.: And if you think Hitchcock couldn't possibly have missed with this material, take a look at Gus Van Sant's almost ludicrously incompetent scene-for-scene remake.",10
5 November 2005,Awesome work of art!,"Alfred Hitchcock takes over an hour and a half in his movie masterpiece, Psycho, to set up the audience for the dénouement scene, i.e. the scene in which Norman Bates' mother first reveals herself. The truth about her is so unexpected that it startles the first-time viewer into immediate and involuntary contemplation concerning the nature of the relationship between her and Norman.

The first-time viewer is virtually coerced by Hitchcock to start thinking and theorizing in order to satisfy the viewer's own inherent need to make sense out of what is happening in the movie. It is reminiscent of some of William Faulkner's best work, in that it conjures up all sorts of unshown images in one's mind.

The most amazing aspect of this great movie consists of its utter believability from beginning to end. These bizarre events could all really have happened! Go see this movie on the big screen. Don't talk to anyone who has seen it about its many secrets. You are best advised to discover those secrets for yourself, in due course. You will be artfully manipulated and mesmerized by the unexcelled genius of Alfred Hitchcock, in a way that is only rivaled by the likes of the great Orson Wells.

If you have heart trouble, don't go to this movie. Although the movie really is wonderful, it's not quite worth dying for. Really.",10
19 June 2021,A well-crafted film,"A brilliant movie with an amazing performances. It keeps your attention throughout and is never boring. The plot is structured In a way that not everything that appears is as it seems. Strong character work, intelligent cinematic touches. Ceverly shot. There's lot suspense, thrills and above all mystery.

For sure, edge of your set shocks and more importantly, the birth of modern horror. Based loosely on the gruesome slayings of Ed Gein.

8 September 1998,The greatest film of all time,"This is by far and away the greatest movie I have ever seen. Hitchcock did a great job directing this movie. It grabbed your attention at the very first and then something else happened, and then something else, and things kept piling on until you had no clue how the ending was going to turn out. This is the kind of movie you think about for hours after you see it because there's so much to it! And then of course the marvelous ending. I won't say it here in case if you haven't seen it, luckily when I saw it I didn't even know the ending. You must MUST go see this film if you haven't yet, Hitch's best.

16 September 1998,After 38 years it still delivers the goods.,"Alfred Hitchcock is still my favorite director and with Psycho he proved that a great director can make a great film for less than one million dollars. The shower scene could be the greatest scene ever put down on film. Everyone puts in 100%. From Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's chilling all string score Psycho can never be remade.

1 January 2021,The standard of the thriller,"The standard of the thriller. It is impossible to admit that the film was shot 60 years ago, this is perhaps only a picture. Despite the fact that in those days films on color film were already shot at all, the BW film goes much better. Just structurally, the plot relies on fantastic suspense. So it's only right to show him Hitchcock

20 September 1998,The most brilliant movie I've ever seen!!,"I just saw Psycho for the first time about 3 weeks ago....and I'm still in awe. Alfred Hitchcock is the greatest film-maker of all time. Every shot in that movie, couldn't have been done better. I was amazed that I hadn't heard about the movie...well, what happens in it, in all my 20 years :) And I'm so glad that I never heard anything....cause it was so fun to watch :) Anthony Perkins, IS Norman Bates. No one could have picked a better man for the role. He's just so darn cute :) It is a WONDERFUL movie...and beautifully done. Hitchcock is a master in his trade :)

17 March 2021,So much more than that shower scene!!,"Despite being 60 years old, Psycho holds up remarkably well. This is thanks to a wholly unique soundtrack that, whilst simple in nature, maintains tension throughout the film.

Despite knowing the infamous shower scene and the shocking twist ending which the film is known for, I was pleased to know there was so much more to enjoy with Psycho.

To my surprise, Bates Motel doesn't feature until approximately 30 minutes into the film, yet by then, the viewer has become enthralled in the supposed beginning of a cat and mouse chase with Janet Leigh's Marion stealing $40,000 and about to be hunted by her sister, employer, lover and police (er). As such, it is clear to see why the murder in the shower is as iconic as it is. It shatters any preconceived notion for where a first-time viewer would think the story is going. It shifts the protagonist from the innocent yet determined Marion, to Anthony Perkins' consistently panicked motel manager with extreme parental issues.

On top of the music, Hitchcock's makes the scenery so vivid you nearly forget it's all in black and white. Furthermore, the dialogue is flawless, with a final line that could rival Silence of the Lambs for being spine chilling in its potential repercussions. The definition of classic!",9
27 February 2022,Hitchcock's masterpiece,"I've only seen one other Hitchcock film (The Birds, pretty bad) but Hitchcock made a masterpiece here, Psycho is a film that once you see once, you never forget, I just got done watching it and I can say it's one of the best horror films that has ever been made.

Psycho set the bar for suspense and filmmaking, Hitchcock really lived up to the name of the master of suspense, it's white-knuckled and one of the most suspenseful films I've ever seen.

Psycho reignited and pretty much started the slasher genre and for good reason, it's something audiences in the 60's weren't used to and even in 2022 it absolutely chilled me.

Anthony Perkins's performance is next-level, one of the creepiest performances I've ever seen any actor give, the shower scene is still iconic and there's been much discussion about the film's final twist.

For good reason too, Psycho has one of the best twist endings in any movie ever, it really gets under your skin and the final shot is haunting, it also has some of the most beautiful shots in film history.

The musical score is also iconic and incredible, this film's story is simple but unravels and eats away at you.

Psycho continues to be thrilling to this day, and I'm gonna give it an A+",10
1 July 2015,The most infamous title ever made,"Low key, psychological thriller/ horror, groundbreaking in its time, it still holds up well today. Antiheroine steal thousands and goes on the run, takes refuge in the Bates Motel (briefly)

Rather than just simply rehash the plot, like 12 billion other reviewers, I'll comment on two of my favourite scenes in this movie

As Marion chats with Bates over sandwiches that evening, we never really feel like there is any connection between the two. She is afraid of being found out, but so is Bates, so they do actually have something in common. They are both putting on a show for the other, pretending to have nothing to hide. Antiheroine and villain, conversing over sandwiches, sitting under watchful eyes of taxidermied animals. We don't see them in the same frame either which makes them both seem even more distant, detached.

Another favourite scene is Bates' thin frame standing at the edge of the lake, silently contemplating Arborgast's death, as his car slowly sinks into the muddy Waters. This shot looks like a painting, a beautiful, perfectly done shot; yet it is also creepy, as its beauty conceals Bates horrifying crimes.

(The exteriors of the house were used in the Thriller anthology series, episode 7, season 1, The Purple Room.)",10
23 June 2022,Phenomenal: Groundbreaking Cinema,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
4 August 2023,Great Watch,"Lately I have been watching older movies. I thing I noticed is how much I enjoyed the dialogues. Well written and well spoken. Psycho is nothing different. Enjoyable dialogue and flow throughout the movie.

Amazing amazing amazing amazing performance by Anthony Perkins. Enjoyed every single minute he was on because he really immersed himself in the role and did a marvelous job. Even the character he portrayed really disturbing and suited him.

A little slow paced for my liking but it's a thriller and didn't feel bored at all. A lot of nerve wrecking scenes especially as Alfred Hitchcock used a lot scoring and music in this movie. It felt at one point that every second there was sound effects.

Amazing acting by everyone, Directing/Cinematography by the Legend Hitchcock, and scoring.

Great watch.",8

27 October 2020,Brilliant,"If a movie which is 60 years old effects you, then for sure it is brilliant. Psycho which came in 1960 was ahead of it's time. Each and every scene of this movie is perfect. Not even a single scene was unnecessary.

The acting by all the actors especially the role of Bates was perfectly done. The plot was different and had a lot of surprises at the end. The climax was really unpredictable. Movie had a lot of iconic scenes like shower scene and Bate smiling climax.

The direction could not be better. Full marks for direction. Even after being a black and white movie, it is none less than coloured one.

Overall, I will recommend this to everyone. A must watch.

13 December 2005,A film that will stay in you LONG after you've seen it,"What more can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's most popularly received(perhaps not his best,quality-wise)film?

Perhaps this: some forty-five years after it was released,it's still referenced and easily accessible movie in regards to movies creating visceral dread and natural shock. Even though Hitch wanted to make this as spare and nuanced a movie as he possibly could(note that this was a B&W film in 1960,when most movies had gone to color and various forms of ""Sens-a-round"" type cinema gimmicks of the period to capture.""shock"" and ""thrill"" moviegoers),the amount of care put into matching Bernard Hermann's tense score with the seemingly common-place events leading towards the horrors being hidden in the Bates Motel.

Lastly,the show is a veritable maze of curiosity,where the film begins as a tracking of the moral quandaries of one MArion Crane(Janet Leigh,beautiful and haunting as a VERY weak and corruptible character here),who,working a dead-end job and having an affair with a married man,decides to abscond with $40,000 of an investor's money. Her run from,well,everything,leads her to the seedy BAtes motel and one Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins,whose long career boiled down to this role). The rest is pretty well-known by anyone familiar with this movie.

This is a must-see for ANY film-lover. And in all likelihood,this movie will stay with the viewer,images AND sounds,long after one has viewed it.",9
3 October 2021,The Greatest Horror Film Ever Made?,"October 3 2000

Psycho is considered a cult classic and it is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and this is without a doubt his most renowned film. I saw it for the first time today and I understand all the praise it receives, it's the definition of a perfect horror film.

Psycho tells a simple story of a woman who is going rogue with 40,000 dollars in her pocket. When she's in her car, rain starts pouring so she inevitably decides to stop at a tiny and secluded motel. Little does she know that the owner is a crazed psychopath.

Filming Psycho in black and white only helps the movie become the cult classic it has turned out to be today, imagine watching the shower scene without the B&W filter, it definitely wouldn't have the same effect. And it doesn't just help certain iconic scenes, it makes the whole movie feel ominous and very sinister. The characters are just remarkable and the most memorable of them all is Norman Bates. It's exciting to delve into this character's hidden psychotic personality. Throughout the movie's runtime he is almost winking at us, giving us hints that we shouldn't be fooled by his formal appearance, he is controlling his sociopathic behaviour inside of him. He does not want to unveil his second personality to the audience until the very end. He is a frightening character because he looks completely normal but there is this impending doom and terror that follows him around wherever he goes. You have the feeling he's a disturbed individual but you don't get enough proof to fully be sure of it.

The setting is very chilling and can often be hair-raising. There are multiple frames of the dreary, gloomy, dull and greyish mansion that Norman Bates considers his world. The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful. The camera setups manipulate the audience and ultimately hides them from the truth. Another element of the film that we barely ever see in modern films is when the main character dies in the first act. She was the central figure of the story but her sudden death moves her out of the spotlight and she inevitably becomes a false protagonist.

I highly recommend Psycho, it could almost be perceived as a character study. Every dialogue and frame is iconic, it stands the test of time and has the privilege of calling itself the greatest horror movie ever made.",9
23 February 2022,Hitchcock's Most Impactful Film!,"62 years after release, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho remains the auteur's most impactful film. He made incredible thrillers such as Vertigo, North by Northwest, and The Birds, but can any of these pictures match the cultural and film impact this particular film had? Even though the major surprises have long been spoiled, this still remains a masterpiece in tension and manipulation. Some consider this to be the start of the slasher genre which of course allowed films such as 1978's Halloween to be produced. Hitchcock made some very bold directorial choices that stands the test of time...including murdering the protagonist about a third through the thriller. That shower scene remains one of the most effective murder scenes ever created. There are no knife cuts or wounds displayed. There is a little amount of blood as Hitchcock felt like the audience would not be ready for such gore, but Gus Van Sant later repudiated that fact in his shot-to-shot 1998 remake. Rather, Hitchcock used sharp editing techniques and various camera angles to full effect. Bernard Herrmann's score of screeching violins and cellos is the final straw that made this scene legendary. To this day, it remains one of the best scenes in cinema, in my personal opinion. It received mixed reviews upon release (mainly because critics were forced to see the film with an audience) but a reevaluation was much kinder. Without a doubt, this is Hitchcock's best film (out of many incredible films). There is no denying its impact on cinema as a psychoanalytical thriller. I was surprised to see how much analysis is out there.

Paramount did not want the film to be made at all. They felt like the audience would not care for such a movie. Hitchcock shot the film for only $800,000, a low budget amount for this time frame. Instead of using a large crew, he used his Alfred Hitchcock Presents television crew to save money. He chose to shoot the film in black-and-white...which also helped the movie itself. It allowed the film to show less gore. The Bates Motel and house were built on the Universal backlot. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins were bankable stars, but they had to take a major pay cut like Hitchcock did. Bernard Herrmann actually received a doubled salary because of his influential music. The director originally intended not to have music during the murder scene. We should all be thankful for Herrmann's insistence. Hitchcock got away with his picture being more sexual. In 1960, the Production Code was failing. Right away, in the opening scene, where Leigh and John Gavin are making love, that is proof that no one cared about the code. That also applies to the murder scene. There were only very few edits that the director had to made. So yes, the film is more sexual in nature when compared with Hitchcock's earlier films.

Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a Phoenix-based assistant who laments over the fact that she cannot marry her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin) over his alimony payments. She finds an opportunity to steal $40,000 in cash from her boss's client and escape to California where she can marry Sam. She makes it very close to the border and decides to sleep for the night at Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Bates has had little business since they moved the state highway. He lives with his mother on the big house on the hill overlooking the hotel. Marion learns that his mother is a mad, controlling woman but Norman chalks it up to mental illness. She later decides to return the money to Phoenix...but never makes it. Sam, along with Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and an investigator, Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) arrive at the hotel to make their own inquiries over Marion's disappearance. It is important to note that Norman's mother is very protective of her son.

The performances are great throughout. Janet Leigh has never been better as she had a commanding screen presence. Anthony Perkins is great at garnering sympathy from the audience. Even though he commits the murders, there is much more to the truth. One could say that Norman becomes the protagonist after Marion Crane is out of the picture. That is analysis for another time. The supporting cast is wonderful. Martin Balsam is a great investigator!

Even if you go into the film knowing every surprise, Psycho is a tense, melodramatic thriller with Alfred Hitchcock at his very best. I can only imagine the pure shock of the audience in 1960 seeing such vivid imagery for the first time. Hitchcock actually instituted a rule where no latecomers were allowed. Gee, wish that rule was in place for all movies. He made some very bold choices and he made every dollar in his limited budget count. The shower scene is one of the best scenes ever (Hitchcock purportedly used 60-75 different cameras to get the many shots needed so he could rapidly edit them together. Paramount had no intention of getting the film made yet through Hitchcock's perseverance, this is his best film (and that is saying something).

My Grade: A+",10
31 May 2009,Without serious rivals as the greatest thriller ever.,"One of the most famous of all films, so much so that people who have never seen it know about the shower scene, or can quote, ""A boy's best friend is his mother."" Yet, Psycho is so much more than ""that scary movie with the shower scene."" In fact, it is not even a horror film by any stretch of the imagination; Hitchcock was too sophisticated for that. This is a mystery thriller, the first part being thriller and the second being mystery.

One of the elements that make this a timeless piece of cinema is the way Hitchcock sets up the back story to the character of Marion Crane and the relationship between her and Norman Bates. From the moment these stories begin, we start to get involved without knowing that Hitchcock is toying with us. I cannot ruin any spoilers, since this is a film to enjoy the first time and then maybe a second time. But, it is important to know that even though this has influenced practically every horror movie since, it is nothing like any of them. Hitchcock shot in black and white to not appear gory and used old-school tricks like music and editing to create images in our mind much scarier than on the screen.

Speaking of music, has there ever been a more perfect score written for a film since this masterful work by Bernard Herrmann? In every scene it is used, it underlies the drama and increases the suspense in a way no modern director could ever do with blood and grotesque imagery.

The cast is wonderful, especially Janet Leigh as Marion and Anthony Perkins as Norman. As good as Leigh is in bringing us to her side, Perkins gives arguably one of the greatest performances in all of cinema. The little details, the stuttering, the twitching, the eyes moving all around go unnoticed the first few times. Then, after awhile you notice it and see that he almost completely makes us sympathize with this character. If you've seen this before, you know what an incredible job it is, although it is a shame Perkins never got out from under Bates' shadow. What is even worse is that they made three sequels to this movie, focusing more on Norman and the violence that I am sure ensued. Forget those attempts to capture your attention and be sure to view this masterpiece at least once. That's all it takes before you will look at your mother a little differently.",10
4 July 2009,"when a film can still shock and horrify an audience after nearly fifty years, it deserves to be remembered","The master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, is a director famous for a great many films. His movies and his passion for the crime of murder cemented into our collective consciousness images of terror and panic that even people who have never seen his movies can identify and pick out. Hitchcock made a stream of remarkable films over the course of his legendary career including the thrill ride ""Rear Window"" (1954) and his ultimate psychological masterpiece ""Vertigo"" (1958), but the film everybody remembers and relates to when discussing Hitchcock is his notorious 1960 box office smash ""Psycho"" and the scene everybody remembers is the one that made many people, including one of its performers, Janet Leigh, think twice before taking a shower again.

""Psycho"", adapted from a novel by Robert Bloch, is the classic story of a woman from Phoenix (Janet Leigh) who in order to marry her financially-stressed lover (John Gavin), embezzles $40,000 dollars from her employer's client and finds herself on the run, fearing and panicking every face that looks in her direction. During her flee more or less from her morals, she checks into a desolate motel run by a handsome but strange young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What follows is the film's infamous ""shower scene"" and a long chain of thrills, frights, and terrifying images that people, to this very day, never forget.

A film can be viewed as a true work of art when it has the same effect on an audience as it did nearly half a decade again. It has been forty-nine years since ""Psycho"" was first released and to this day, it still terrifies and appalls people very much like it did in 1960. To some, such as Walt Disney himself, ""Psycho"" is just too much. It's really the ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) of its day. But to those who can appreciate art and storytelling, this is a motion picture that simply cannot be refused repeated viewings.

The pivotal performance of the film is, without a doubt, Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins. The acting by Perkins is so iconic and so creepy and so off-putting that he really set the standards for slasher villains and frightening characters. It is so ironic that an actor so harmless-looking, so timid-sounding as Perkins could, in an instant, turn himself into the image of a sick, bloodthirsty psychopathic monster. He can become creepy without apparently even making an effort, as though he were in real life as deranged as his character. Perkins' Norman Bates is like the Charles Foster Kane of horror movies. He's been mimicked, but never matched or overpowered. The only real contender for a match is Hannibal Lecter by Anthony Hopkins. Whoever is creepier is up to you, but it's nevertheless a very close match.

""Psycho"" is not a film that is about character development, but it doesn't need to be. In fact, extreme character development would get in the way. Norman Bates is strongly developed, but the other characters are established exceedingly well and then play from that point on. Janet Leigh, in particular, who takes up the first third of the movie almost entirely by herself, gives a great performance even though her character is very simple. Hitchcock used Leigh as a personification of the human fears and sins: guilt, panic, fear, envy, and lust. The film also features a well-cast Martin Balsam as a private investigator who tends to, like Hitchcock felt about some of his producers, get in the way too often without understanding fully what or whom he's dealing with.

And of course, we can't leave out the thrills of the movie. Hitchcock used his techniques of shock, horror, and suspense to their fullest in this film. He uses the two main horror procedures: alerting an audience of an impending threat without telling the character or simply having the scare jump out and ""render you speechless"" as some of the ads for ""Psycho"" claimed the movie would do. And there is certainly more than just the infamous shower scene. It's not just the brutal killings. Again, there's Anthony Perkins in the landmark role of his career, and the black-and-white photography is notably far more effective than if Hitchcock had decided to shoot the movie in color (look at the dismal 1998 shot-by-shot remake for proof) and of course there's Bernard Herrmann's iconic all-string music score that rivets and lunges out at you.

Although it is an intensely frightening film and ends with one of the creepiest final lines of all time, ""Psycho"" is so much more than just a horror story. Apart from the dawn of the slasher genre and a montage of spine-tingling images, it is a work of art done by one of the true geniuses of the cinema: Alfred Hitchcock. And while I don't feel this is his all-time best motion picture, it's certainly his most famous and deservedly so. When a film can shock and terrify an audience nearly fifty years since it was first released and tags an excellent story along with it, it deserves to be remembered.",10
4 March 2001,This is one to watch again and again.,"Alfred Hitchcock's crisp efficiency is not unlike that of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the dutiful son who cleans up after his mother in the landmark thriller ""Psycho."" Not only is this a masterfully directed suspense chiller, it actually set standards by which all fright films since have been measured. The cinema has produced some great scores, but Bernard Herrmann's music is incredibly enhancing and simply unforgettable, one of the best ever (and it did not even get an Oscar nomination for Best Score). The more I watch ""Psycho,"" the more I prefer the first half, with its sense of dread and a fascinatingly cool Janet Leigh (Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). Hitchcock, of course, never won the Best Director Oscar, but was nominated for ""Psycho,"" one of 1960's biggest box-office hits. Shockingly, Anthony Perkins, in a career-making role and one of the most famous performances in screen history, failed to win a Best Actor nomination -- probably because the performance was too edgy and disturbing (which is what made it great). Some scenes are dated, of course, but this film almost never falters. It gets a ""9"" (and a very high nine at that) from me.",9
1 April 2005,"Room Service, Please","Alfred Hitchcock guarded the plot of PSYCHO against publicity, and in 1960 audiences came to the film without being able to anticipate the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. More than forty years later, the movie's fame is such that even those who have not seen it are often able to sketch the basic outline of the story in a few words. This demonstrates the film's fame; what demonstrates it quality, however, is the fact that even those who know the plot before seeing it are seldom disappointed.

Very loosely based on Robert Bloch's pulp novel, which was itself very loosely based on killer Ed Gein, PSYCHO presents us with the tale of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)--who, in a moment of madness, steals forty-thousand dollars. Running scared, Marion checks into the out-of-the-way Bates Motel. And there, as production notes for the recent DVD release gracefully state, she becomes the most grossly inconvenienced hotel guest in cinema history.

The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a deluge of low budget and badly made films that commanded box office business via tawdry subject matter, and according to lore director Alfred Hitchcock was curious to see what might happen if he himself made such a film--but made it well. Working with a remarkable script and gifted cast and crew, the result was a masterpiece. Although it is often described as a horror film, PSYCHO is less horror than it is a study in paranoia and suspense, and certainly a lesson in the fact that one need not bother with graphic gore or big budgets to impress audiences.

Much of the film's success is in its detail. Joseph Stephano's script is memorable for its repetition of verbal motifs and its extremely disquieting tone; Bernard Herrman's famous all-strings score builds tremendously upon it. The simple yet meticulous sets communicate building unease, and the strangely flat, semi-documentary black and white cinematography has a voyeuristic edge that is extremely disturbing.

There are elements that can be justly criticized--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about. But in the end, this is the film for which Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin will forever be remembered... and one of the several films that will forever be associated with one of the twentieth century's most masterful directors.

12 January 2007,"So Influential, It Makes My Head Spin","A young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 (roughly a quarter million today) from her employer and runs off to meet her boyfriend. But along the way she stops at the Bates Motel, and meets the charming Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion and her money might not make it back to her boyfriend Sam in perfect condition.

Yes, after 47 years of this film existing and being a horror fan for well over 10 years now, I finally broke down and watched what is widely considered to be Hitchcock's best film (I had previously seen ""Lamb to Slaughter"", ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" -- and have now seen many more since). Boy, was I missing out on something! Now I cannot wait to see ""Psycho 2"" and ""Psycho 3"" (which I own for some reason). I have seen parts of the Gus Van Sant remake but was not impressed.

The acting was very good, especially from Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He did a great job as a friendly boy-next-door caretaker. Vivian Leigh was also good as Marion Crane, and I am sorry she had to have a hermaphroditic child like Jamie Lee Curtis. All other parts were fine. I hear they called the actor who played Sam Loomis ""the stiff"" and boy are they right! Later in the film he loosens up a little bit, but in the opening scene he seems so wooden.

The bird symbolism is nice... especially with Hitchcock's other big horror film being ""The Birds"". And the main character being Marion ""Crane""? Is she going to get stuffed like the other birds in the parlor? I will not say, but you probably already know (since pretty much everyone knows about this film even if they never saw it).

Most startling for me was Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the main theme (not the knife noise). I had long heard rumors that ""Re-Animator"" ripped off the ""Psycho"" theme and I thought they meant it was a variation on the theme. An homage, perhaps (because who would try to steal from such a famous film). Well, the music is exactly the same. I mean, really dead on. So now I do not know how to feel about ""Re-Animator"", which is practically my favorite horror film (with all due respect to ""The Janitor"")... which shakes up my whole foundation and makes me rethink movie history!

My only complaint was the confusion (at least for me) of where the Bates Motel is. Marion drives all Friday night and then arrives Saturday evening, implying it is a great distance from Phoenix. Yet, when the detective investigates the motel, he tells someone on the phone he is less than an hour from them. Where is he based if not Phoenix?

Well, if you have not seen this, you should. It is a classic and with good reason (as I typed this the first time, it was ranked the 22nd greatest film of all time on Internet Movie Database and still lingers around 25th three years later). Not just a great horror classic, but also a great film with great directing and cast. Plus, if you are from Wisconsin like I am, you'll love the Ed Gein storyline. (Incidentally, if you have never visited Ed Gein's hometown or grave, you should. It is a good time.)",9
2 December 1999,From the point of view of a Media Student,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

14 December 2005,The Master shows how to make a film,"According to history, at the end of the 50s Hitchcock saw that many low-budget films were gaining many audience; knowing the flaws in those films, he decided to try to make a low-budget film and see what happened when in his words ""an experienced director"" does a low budget film. The result was ""Psycho"".

Loosely based on Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, ""Psycho"" is a superbly done film in almost every aspect, and shows the perfection of Hitchcock's technique. The Master was at that time at the peak of his art.

Scripwriter Joseph Stefano makes a different take on Bloch's novel and tells the story of Marion Crane, a woman who in an impulsive act steals $40 thousand dollars from her boss; in her escape, she spends the night at the Bates Motel, only to discover the dark secret that hides the owners, Norman Bates and his mother.

Done with a budget of $800,000, ""Psycho"" is perfectly conceived as it never goes too far from what it pretends to do. Hitchcock worked closely to Stefano in order to know exactly what type of take he was going to do.

Filmed in Black and White in a time when color was already the dominant format, the sharp contrast between light and darkness is a beautiful remark of what lies hidden inside Bates Motel.

Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, Marion and Norman respectively, give an outstanding performance in their roles. Perkins clearly dominates the character of Norman and it is obvious why was he type-casted as Bates, his performance and the character is so well developed by the script that is impossible to not feel empathy for him.

Many words could be written about Psycho, but all that must be said is that this film shows what film-making is about. The perfect mixture of art and entertainment. Now, after many parodies, homages and sequels, the movie still retains its power and it is definitely, one of the movies every person in the world should see at least once. 10/10. Masterpiece.",10

5 October 2022,A milestone in cinema! Simply a masterpiece.,"A masterpiece in horror / suspense, very important for current horror, being revered to this day. It abruptly turned all the stigma and style of the films of the time, changing the way of telling a story of this genre.

Directed by the genius Alfred Hitchcock, the film has a sinister aura, it seems that the suspense is palpable as it is in the film. Part of this also comes from the soundtrack, simply impeccable! You may not know it's from here, but you've definitely heard it!

An exceptional script, with several breaks in expectations, we wolf making you fail miserably when we try to guess what's to come. In addition to the excellent performances, which close this absolute classic.

1 June 2022,"Ode to Hitchcock, part one","I never fancied thrillers or detective stories because they are almost identical to the core: a premise, a murder, a search and a capture of a murderer - and once you know who did it there's no pleasure, no suspense in watching it again because you know the ending. But there are exceptions.

""Psycho"" is an all-time classic, thrilling story of Norman Bates and his mother directed by my personal second best director of all times Mr Alfred Hitchcock in his last great body of work (in my opinion). I had an obsession with Hitch's movies back in the days and I watched all of those he had done working in America, coincidentally starting with this one. ""Psycho"" has become the sole reason I dug into his filmography, spent a lot of quality time watching his movies and found myself keeping almost two dozen of them in my collection.

Put aside what I said about losing interest in watching the movie again after you know the ending - it's all about what does the movie bring you in particular and the thoughts that it makes you think over and over in your head. Because by the second time you watch even closer, analyzing every mimic and every gesture of every person, looking for clues for his/her behavior but still maintaining to keep the intrigue and not letting to spoil the upcoming twists for you - so it's all about the story actually: if it's great, suspenseful and meaningful you will watch it countless times and that's exactly what I'm planning to do with ""Psycho"".

I don't know why does Janet Leigh's name appear last in the credits because her screen time is much longer than any other character and she does the best of every second of it. Anthony Perkins still scares the hell out of me with his performance at the end - he has done an incredible job transforming himself from a seamlessly harmless person into the titular psycho. Magnificent and disquieting score by Bernard Herrmann hooks you up from the beginning and doesn't allow you to leave for a minute. And Alfred oh boy, he was and still is a genius, a master and a legend; is there really anything else left to say about him or this masterpiece?!...",10
4 December 2014,Psycho (1960),"This is a classic horror film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. When talking about Hitchcock, people most refer his directing towards this film.

This is a black and white, which stars Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates), Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) and Vera Miles (Lila Crane). The movie itself is an icon for all other horror movies. The house on the hill can be recognized by all, and when questioned, you'll hear a response- the house from ""Psycho"" You basically have a woman who's on the run for stealing money from her boss (Marion Crane). A motel owner, who has psychological issues (Norman Bates)and a woman who is in search of her missing sibling (Lila Crane).

In a nutshell you have a man who commits murders, while dressed up as a woman. However if you never saw the film, you would suspect that it was a woman...and would point fingers at Norman Bates mother.. however that is not the case.

8 December 2014,Psycho,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
29 October 1999,A Master piece,"I have been reading some of the comments about Psycho and was shocked to read that some of the viewers thought that it was rubbish. You have to realise that for its day it was a shocker. It broke all the conventions of the horror films in that day. Every shot was carefully thought out, for example, because of film laws, Hitchcock couldn't show the knife touch the body in Shower scene, but the way that it was shot made you believe that you were seeing it.

Many people prefere the new version because it is in colour. Colour films had been around for quite some time when the film was made. Hitchcock decided to make it in Black and White for a reasion. You have to agree that it makes the film very scary. The shadows are enhanced on the house and Norman's face appears to be horribly hollow, just like the final image of his mother.

In my opinion, the new version is good, but the use of colour changes the initial image that Hitchcock wanted to put across.

21 January 2021,One of my favourite ever films,"Psycho is one of the most stylish and creative films of all time, easily in my top 5 films ever. Anyone who gives this below an 8 needs to revaluate their decision.

Psycho is masterfully directed by Alfred Hitchcock and beautifully acted. Every character is brilliant, Anthony Perkins is sublime as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh is perfect as Marion Crane, it was refreshing to see a woman as the main character. But Norman Bates has to take the spot for best character, perhaps in any horror film ever.

The plot is simple to follow, or it seems like it. Being shot in black and white allows for the picture quality to be very high and whilst you're watching the shower scene notice how much eerier it is to see just this shadow figure of a woman silhouetted and slowly advancing from the background, the appreciated low shot angles also heightens the manipulative techniques Hitchcock uses. Additionally all of the film's action is plot driven, there's not one scene that doesn't contribute in some way to the overall film.

10/10: Probably the greatest thriller ever",10
22 November 2014,The Great Cinematic Poem,"The strings of Bernard Herrmann combined with the screams of Janet Leigh, the knife of Norman Bates and the cuts of Alfred Hitchcock makes the movie moment that penetrated pop culture like no other.

My impression is that Psycho is perceived as purely a great piece of craft and entertainment, but in my mind what makes Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho such a singular work is the deep and personal poetry it contains.

Hitchcock was completely fearless in his ideas at this point. He makes his most radical and innovative film. The movie is heightened from his famous thrillers to a pure and modern horror movie. The visual universe is now dirty and grim as opposed to beautiful and glamorized. The icy and sophisticated blonds are gone and there are no traces of sympathetic heroes.

Everyone who has seen an interview with Alfred Hitchcock knows that he hides behind an inflated and parodic character. In his interviews he is very secretive and doesn't revel anything about himself. The opposite is true in his films. In his movies he is often completely open and naked. He exposes the most shameful truths about himself and his life. In Psycho he does a personal examination on a level beyond anything I've ever seen. He puts himself in the space where he is the most vulnerable. He offers a ""peeping hole"" into the darkest corners of his personality. The movie is extremely revealing, but in very subtle ways. One has to work to find the treasures of Psycho.

Psycho is like a novel in the way images are often suggested and has to be completed in the heads of the audience. The sexual and violent scenes are never explicit. This makes the movie even more disturbing than it ever could be if we had seen the images, and this was also the only way Hitchcock could convey what he wanted to convey and still get past the ridiculously strict American censorship laws of the time.

Sexuality is always a theme in a Hitchcock movie, but he never explored it as profoundly or intimately as he did in Psycho. The shower scene for example feels like a rape as much as it does a murder(the feeling intrusion, the nakedness and so on). Norman desperately desires Marion Crane. He is sexually satisfied by killing her(it might be a stretch, but I see the knife as a symbol of the male sex organ). This scene is all about the childish shame of Normans sexuality. Norman, or the mother side of him, tries to suppress his sexuality completely. This is one of the examples of the openness of Hitchcock in this movie. His catholic upbringing would suggest a lot of shameful sexuality in his life as well. Something he has in common with his biggest contemporary director hero, Luis Bunuel. Bunuel are one of very few directors who explored his own sexuality with anything close to the amount of honesty of Psycho.

Psycho is such a rich movie. It is filled with details. I believe you could watch it fifty times over and still find something new the fifty first time you watch it. Pay for example attention to all the little symbols and metaphors scatterd all over every single frame. Notice all the fascinations or ""fetishes"" of Hitchcocks that he put into it. The stuffed birds and the way they mirror Normans mother. The way food and eating connects with murder and sex. The peeping hole as a symbol for voyeurism and the movie camera. The cellar as a symbol of the suppressed and the shameful truths about Norman Bates. I really want to go into all these details, but like I said, there are too many and too much to discuss. It wont fit into the format of an IMDb review...

If you don't see the same things I do in this movie, please watch it again. Even more than the magnificent ""Vertigo"" Psycho has the ability to grow immensely on a second viewing, and continue to grow on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth... In my heart it has grown to be one of the absolute best films in movie history.",9
21 April 2016,Psycho Superb!,"This is a splendid movie that shows Alfred Hitchcock at the top of his form. This movie came right after North by Northwest, also by Hitchcock, so it has to be one of the best one-two punches by a director in film history. The first half of the movie, dominated by the character of Marion Crane, is to me, the superior part, without any disrespect to the rest of the film. Janet Leigh's controlled performance is so convincing we feel every nerve-wracking moment after that first excruciating misdeed. From the opening scene over the skyline of Phoenix into the hotel room of Marion and Sam, I was drawn into the movie in a way that only a great movie can achieve. Audiences often complain that a movie can seldom measure up to a good book; however, a great movie can do visual tricks and show nuances very effectively in the hands of a great director. This movie is a case in point. The camera zooms into an envelope holding $40,000 or a peephole where Anthony Perkins, as Norman Bates, observes Marion undressing. The music is like chalk on a blackboard as the sharp violin strings heighten the nauseating fear that we feel along with Marion. The closeup of the police officer in sunglasses is almost terrifying. The pounding of the rain on the windshield is something almost everyone can feel and in this case, it seems like the world is crowding in on Marion. Scene by scene we go from one vignette to another. Vera Miles, as Marion's sister, and John Gavin, as Marion's lover, give brilliant performances as they try to get to the truth of Marion's disappearance. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Martin Balsam as Abrogast, the private eye. Anthony Perkins gives his career defining role, although he had many great roles. This was the only Hitchcock role for Leigh and Petkins and they made these characters their own. Highly recommend because it shows the great potential of film/making.",9

25 April 2021,I Wouldn't Recommend Staying at the Bates Motel,"As a self proclaimed cinephile, I'm ashamed that there are some classics I have yet to see. 'Psycho' was one of them, but not anymore!

The lead up to Marion Crane arriving at the Bates Hotel was alright, but once she arrives and Norman comes on screen the movie really takes off. After watching the whole thing it was very clear why it's so iconic as a thriller/horror. The music is piercing and really makes those certain scenes unforgettable.

I'm sure there have been many character analyses that would not actually deem Norman as a psycho. Nevertheless, he's for sure messed up and it made for a great flick.

18 August 1999,One of the best movies ever!,"Stunning performances, especially by Anthony Perkins who was never in the future so good. Great photography in b/w. Hitchcock's best film and a masterpiece of directing. The chilling music from Bernard Herrmann I can't forget. I love the scene in the shower, which was later in dozens horror films and the killing of detective Arbogast. I must see Psycho soon again. The sequel was also good, but the color was for me disturbing. Parts 3 and 4 was bad and the new version was very bad. Why make the same movie with bad actors? Vince Vaughn (as new Norman Bates) is better in the film Clay Pigeons. There he is also villain and I can this movie also recommend.

26 March 2021,MASTERPIECE,"A lengthy career directing movies prepared Hitchcock for this technical triumph of film craftsmanship. The perfect storyboarding and editing make it a model for professionals and students alike. The casting and acting are equally great, as is the Oscar nominated cinematography of John L. Russell, the editing of George Tomasini and the music of Bernard Hermann, with the titles by Saul Bass setting the mood. All four of these men worked frequently with ""Hitch"" in movies or on his TV show. Moviegoers lost sleep, found showers to be a stressful ordeal, and could never quite get this perfectly made film out of their minds, but, at least, we learned one very important fact: ""A boy's best friend is his mother.""

8 May 2020,nice,"This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor. Stop reading thse comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it.

27 April 2002,"At the Bates Motel, you can take a shower...AT YOUR OWN RISK!","One can pinpoint with reasonable certainty where the modern horror movie really began. It began in 1960 with the release of Alfred Hitchcock's all-time masterpiece PSYCHO.

The story of Marion Crane stopping off at the Bates Motel and taking the shower which would live in cinematic history and infamy is so well known that no regurgitation of the plot is necessary. But what is important to know about PSYCHO is the fact that it introduced a number of important elements to the genre that had never been used before. It introduced us to the ""slasher"", in the form of Anthony Perkins' off-balance Norman Bates and his ""Mother."" It bought the horror film firmly into contemporary times by being set in the present. It also took a very unique approach to psychology and murder in a way that no film had done before, and few films have done since.

What is the most significant about PSYCHO's celebrated shower murder, besides the literal knife-edge editing and Bernard Herrmann's classic shrieking strings, is the way Hitchcock depicts this scene. So many slasher films entirely miss the point of that scene, focusing only on the (limited) blood. But Hitchcock manipulates the film in such a way as to make this scene LOOK much more graphic than it really is. It is a brilliant feat of movie-making on the part of the cinema's ultimate Master Of Suspense.

Even the much-criticized final scene involving the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) isn't very bothersome; he brings up the first real honest-to-goodness explanation of a disturbed killer. As he relates Norman's story, he tells the group there in the room, ""He was never all Norman. But he was often ONLY Mother.""

Scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, and loosely based on the case of Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn (which also inspired the 1974 cult masterpiece THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), PSYCHO remains a masterpiece to this very day, even after more than four decades of sequels, imitators, imitators of imitators, and an atrocious remake. No self-respecting fan of horror or suspense movies should be without a copy of this genuine fright classic!",10
24 May 2021,Nah its still the best.,"The birth of all psychological thrillers. Perfect performances from Perkins and Leigh. The musical score is classic and chilling. And Hitchcock has the perfect eye as always. It laid the groundwork for so many of my favorites.

17 February 2002,One of the greatest movies ever made!!,"Alfred Hitchcock is one of THE greatest directors that ever graced us with his cinematic presence. Psycho is a cinematic masterpiece. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and that doesn't happen often. I heard little about this movie except about the dreaded shower scene and that Norman Bates was a bad guy. But when I was watching it I thouht that was just rumor. I thought he was good and the mother was bad. Little did I know. The score by Bernard Hermann is one of the best. I am glad Hitch decided to film it in Black and White. It wouldn't have had the same effect. It is a shame that many people, especially teenagers refuse to watch a black and white movie. ""It is boring."" ""It is old."" It is a CLASSIC!! I am seventeen years old and I have a collection of Hitchcock movies. Give black and white movies a chance. You won't be disappointed.

24 October 2019,PSYCHO's breaking waves still shock the film world,"Although it is virtually impossible to replicate the effect of the original release in 1960, ""Psycho"" remains a disturbing and macabre psychological thriller where we watch a meticulous work with the camera that thickens the suspense coupled with the soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann and Anthony Perkins's performance of Norman Bates, in addition to a most well-structured argument. This is quintessential Hitchcock, inspired by the true case of the murderer Ed Gein. Hitch then frankly defied the limits of the already agonizing, though still active Production Code. ""Psycho"" addressed such themes as adultery, homicide, Oedipus Complex, transvestism, mental disorder, exhumed bodies, everything exposed both subtly and graphically. ""Psycho"" introduced us to an antagonist of enormous psychological density; a psychopath with indelible mental disorders whose causes and motives were only fully discovered in the whodunit's climax.

7 November 2016,Psycho,"Alfred Hitchcock directed probably his best-known work in 1960 with his feature based on the book of the same name by Robert Bloch. Starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and Hitchcock's abandoned would-be star Vera Miles; Psycho explores a desperate woman's attempt to forge a life with her boyfriend, and a man driven by his relationship to his mother. Psycho is a wonderful case study into the psyche of human beings with vastly different outlooks and intentions for their lives. Hitchcock delved into the psychology of humanity in a way to make audiences pay attention all the while creating a complete masterpiece and the film most closely associated with the famed suspense director.

On a December day in Arizona, the audience meets Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who has just spent an extended lunch hour with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is divorced and lives far from Marion so the only time they have together is stolen lunch hours and hotel rooms. Sam is reluctant to further his relationship with Marion, despite the intense love shared between the two, because he pays a monthly alimony to his divorcée wife. Marion has a deep conversation with Sam in regards to the future of their relationship, as she wishes to become a married woman and create a home for Sam. Leaving the hotel room feeling helpless, a little desperate, and enslaved by her love of Sam so much so that she knows herself to be unable to leave him. Upon returning to her office, Marion's boss brings in a client flashing around $40,000 in cash for a transaction. Marion, being the one trusted to take the large sum of cash to the bank, instantly devises a plot in which she and Sam can enjoy a life together, married, together, and happy, if she can get away with the $40,000. Instead of going to the bank, Marion scurries home to pack a bag and embark on a new life. After speeding away on her new mission, Marion's boss passes her on the street initiating a guilt trip that Marion can't escape. After taking a nap on the side of the road, Marion has an interaction with a police officer which puts her even more on edge. Marion, convinced she must trade in her car for a new one after seeing her boss on the street, hastily makes a deal with the dealership o\owner and speeds away hoping to avoid suspicion. After an especially rainy night, Marion has become unsure of her location and pulls into a secluded motel. Emerging from her car for shelter for the night, Marion meets motel owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly nice young man who helps Marion inside with her bags and offers to make her dinner so she doesn't have to go back out into the rain. After hearing a heated exchange between Norman and his mother, Marion offers advice and consolation for Norman, believing his mother to be an overbearing negative presence on his life. Norman is clearly taken aback by what he perceives to be an attack against his mother, Marion is taken aback by his strong reaction and seeks refuge to her room as she has already begun questioning her plan and seems to have decided to go back to Tuscon, return the money, and make amends with her boss. Little does Marion know, Norman and his relationship to his mother would interfere with her plans.

Psycho has reached the point that there is little left to say about this film. It's a near perfect entry on Hitchcock's filmography. Psycho is so closely associated with the famed director that it has been endlessly analyzed and heralded for the masterwork that it is. The standout from the film, other than the brilliant direction of a largely dialogue-driven plot, is the fantastic score. Bernard Herrmann, a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, crafts a perfect horror/suspense score that is as iconically connected to the film as the John Williams score is to Jaws. Granted, I haven't seen much of Anthony Perkins' work, but he was perfectly cast in the role of Norman Bates. Norman had to embody a psychotic crazed maniac inside a quiet, unassuming petulant child all at once, and Perkins was perfect for the extreme marriage of characterization. Martin Balsam is a brilliant character actor and it's always fun to see him pop up in a film. As earlier stated, Psycho is a surprisingly dialogue- driven film, with only a few shots of action sparsed throughout the film. The pivotal scene in which Marion and Norman share dinner together, bringing Marion back to her good- natured self, was filmed in such a perfect way highlighting the taxidermied shells on the wall exposing the possibility that Norman could be a much more sinister character than he initially appears. Hitchcock proves his strength as a suspense director with his seminal classic, Psycho. Near-perfect direction, incredible casting, and a brilliant score, it is clear to see why Psycho has stood the test of time, and remains a favorite and yearly Halloween viewing tradition, for myself anyway.",9
29 October 1998,great,"This is one Hitchcock's best, except for that dumb final speech, which is entirely unnecessary. But it redeems itself with that final shot. Can you believe they've made another ""Psycho?"" This is the worst thing to happen to movies since Ted Turner wanted to colorize ""Citizen Kane,"" but that never happened. This is happening. This just sickens me to think about it. And of course we're going to get those geeky teenagers that will make the film a profit. Gus Van Sant used to be a good director, now he's just another make-movies-for-profit-only director. SELL OUT!

6 March 2005,"If there is one single film that can claim to be THE best of all time, then this is it....","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
10 April 2022,That's what staging is all about,"A first observation, this film is made for television, or at least it shows that Hitchcock was interested in the television format. This is not a defect. And besides we appreciate these close-ups of faces. Alternated with the long shots, to embrace a room, or a setting.

Second, the film distills a permanent tension, without being heavy, but perpetual, through what the characters do. First when we follow Janel Leigh. Then with the detective. Or finally when Vera Miles and John Gavin are present. Diffuse tension that allows the film to hang the viewer until the end. Until the medical explanation at the end.

And the third, the music of Bernard Herrmann, present permanently, is for the blow, important, fully successful (and not only the very known melody of the murder in the bathroom), and by moment very beautiful.

This first of franchise, Psycho, remains effective, because finally little verbose at the level of the dialogues. Alfred Hitchcock tells the story with his direction. A pure film.",9
8 April 1999,The Best Psycho film ever,"This movie is the best Horror film I have seen. To this day this film is still talked about Anthony Perkins best film. Janet Leigh did good also. It had a really creepy ending. But it had mysterious and chilling parts about Norman Bates.

They just did a remake in 1998. But it will never match this one.

This movie also made the way for such films as Halloween and Friday the 13th. But I would say that Alfred Hitchcock will be remembered for this film

28 January 2022,Psycho,"What makes Psycho immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theatre, is that it connects directly with our fears: Our fears that we might impulsively commit a crime, our fears of the police, our fears of becoming the victim of a madman, and of course our fears of disappointing our mothers.

25 November 2020,The greatest of all films,"This film has it all. Not only the greatest horror film of all but also the music is the most perfectly matched to the genre/storyline as is possible to get. From the car windscreen wipers to the shower scene and more there is not a single thing goes against this film Its like a Beatles song. Its done and sets its own mark on the film industry which many come close but can not match or better. No guns, explosions, fires, crashes just a masterpiece of film making.

18 June 2000,"What a nice guy, that Norman!","Quite argueably, ""Psycho"" is the original, and by far the best,

slasher movie. Though pretty much primitive compared to today's

horror movies, this one can still pack a punch, thanks to the

great Alfred Hitchcock's taunt direction and the chilling

Bernard Hermann score. The performances were awesome as well,

especially by Anthony Perkins, the seemingly-friendly momma's

boy Norman Bates, who owns the desolate Bates motel. When a

naughty bank teller named Marion (nicely played by Janet Leigh,

who is Jamie Lee Curtis' mother in real life!) steals 40 grand

from her boss and runs away, decides to stay at the infamous

motel, she seems relieved that the owner of the place is kind

and polite. Little does she know!! Marion receives a nasty

surprise while bathing the motel shower! What follows is a

harrowing trip to find the real killer, who may or may not be

Norman or his mother. An extremely scary flick, ""Psycho"" is the

ultimate chill-fest. Forget anything made by Wes Craven,

""Psycho"" is your ticket for",

22 July 2023,Classic Horror Movie.,"The movie itself is a classic and told really well throughout. I found the story to be really interesting with a runaway enters a motel run by a shy owner with a secret about him. The movie is build up really well throughout and is never boring. I really like how there's a bunch of symbols throughout and is interesting on what is the symbolism means. Also the dialogue is done really well by the performance and is interesting to hear it. The atmosphere is done really well with its awesome music and tone throughout. There's also a couple of scenes that people from the 60's didn't expect to see and those scenes are still effective on how it executed. And I really like the whole mystery over Norman Bates and his backstory.

I found the twist ending to be really great with its revealed and the whole explanation over it.

17 June 2000,Terror,"What more can be said? For sheer terror there is only one Psycho. It's part of our national psyche. Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann; the Master Director with a masterful score by Mr.Herrmann. Hope,Love,Lust,Insanity; it's all here...and much, much more. Is there a more beautiful victim than Janet Leigh? Is there a more kind killer than Anthony Hopkins? Great!!!

8 December 2020,Terrific,"I loved this movie since the first time I saw it. Great script, great acting, great music, and some great plot twists. The acting was outstanding, even by the minor characters.

Hitchcock proved that you can build suspense without resorting to blood and guts.

And the shower scene is actually quite tame compared to what you see today.

25 November 2021,This is a masterpiece of suspense thriller.,"Hitchcock is an undisputed genius.

""Psycho"" was released in 1960. It was made 61 years ago.

However, there were social problems that are still common today.

Children who grow up in complicated families develop multiple personalities.

Parents are overly dependent on their children, and the child retains the personality of the parent.

We can also learn about the psychology of transvestite.

This movie is worth watching again and again.

I like this line: I don't hate her.

I hate what she's become.",8
16 January 2022,8,"Watching this film 66 years after!

I have to say that it was really interesting. I usually do not like old films, but it is Sunday evening...I tried with newer ones and they were bad, so I decided with a classic and I do not regret it!

Eight from me!

Oh and... John Gavin was a hunk ! So handsome. I did give a film a note higher because of him hehehe!

31 May 2023,Cinema's masterpiece,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is widely regarded as a masterpiece of suspense and psychological horror. Released in 1960, the film remains a landmark in cinematic history and has had a significant influence on the thriller genre.

""Psycho"" tells the story of Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh), a secretary who steals money from her employer and goes on the run. She ends up at the secluded Bates Motel, owned by the enigmatic Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). As the film unfolds, it delves into the twisted psychology of Norman and reveals a series of shocking and suspenseful events.

One of the most notable aspects of ""Psycho"" is Hitchcock's masterful direction. He skillfully builds tension throughout the film, using various techniques to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. From the iconic shower scene to the suspenseful moments leading up to it, Hitchcock's precise camera work and editing create an atmosphere of unease and dread.

Anthony Perkins delivers a standout performance as Norman Bates, portraying a complex and disturbed character with subtlety and depth. His portrayal of the character has become iconic, and his transformation throughout the film is both captivating and chilling.

Another notable aspect of ""Psycho"" is its groundbreaking narrative structure. Hitchcock takes unexpected turns and subverts audience expectations, leaving them questioning the nature of the story and its characters. This approach was highly innovative for its time and has had a lasting impact on the thriller genre.

The film's score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, deserves special mention as well. The haunting and memorable music enhances the suspense and contributes to the overall atmosphere of the film.

""Psycho"" is not only a gripping thriller but also a thought-provoking exploration of human psychology and the duality of human nature. It raises questions about identity, repression, and the capacity for violence within seemingly ordinary individuals.

Overall, ""Psycho"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences to this day. Hitchcock's expert direction, Perkins' mesmerizing performance, the innovative narrative structure, and the atmospheric score all contribute to making it a timeless classic in the realm of psychological horror.",10
7 February 2022,One of the best Serial Killer Movies,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9

26 December 1998,Horror classic that lives up to its reputation.,"The best way to approach Psycho would be with no previous knowledge at all. As it is, the shower scene has become one of the most notorious film shots of all-time, and the secret of the Bates family is no longer quite so secretive.

However, even with this in mind, this is an amazing classic : the original horror movie. Hitchcock has always been the master of suspense, and Psycho is just about his most sinister ever. From the Gothic setting - the imposing mansion on the hill - to Norman's boyish manner and tortured intensity, Psycho delivers.

And if it doesn't make you scream (or at least think twice before talking to that self-effacing stranger), nothing will. Psycho truly is an incomparable portrait of a mind twisted into homicidal mania that fully deserves the accolades it has always received.

27 January 2020,Finely crafted and superbly executed - it's still one of the best,"Fed up with life, Phoenix-based secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is entrusted to take an important client's $40,000 to the bank one Friday afternoon. However, Marion sees this as the perfect opportunity to leave her old life behind and start afresh. After driving for a long period of time, Marion decides it's best to get a good night's sleep and checks in to the Bates Motel which is run by mild-mannered Norman and his domineering mother.

I watched this film for the first time a number of years ago and remember being totally blown-away by it. Well it's fair to say that time has mostly being kind to this film as it is still quite an experience.

Hitchcock wasn't called the master of suspense for nothing; of course much of the suspense comes later when we get to the Bates Motel, but there is one scene earlier in the film involving a policeman that achieves this effect with no dialogue (it literally is just a police officer staring at Marion from across the road, but it still managed to be pretty creepy). I also thought the voiceovers of conversations that are taking place in Marion's absence discussing her behaviour, motives etc were an excellent touch. A lot of filmmakers would have cut back to the office or to the car sales yard so we could see these people talking, but seeing it as a voiceover whilst Marion was driving was more suspenseful and tense and was a good move by Hitchcock.

However, it's when the action moves to the Motel when the film really picks up a gear and this is mainly down to the wonderful duo of Hitchcock and Perkins; Hitchcock with his masterful direction in which he leaves a lot to our imagination (I remember the first time I watched this film how much I wanted to see inside the Bates house and how I was on the edge of my seat when Martin Balsam starts to creep up the stairs). However, in front of the camera the film most definitely belongs to Perkins and I think what I liked about his character is that, despite his nature, there is a certain vulnerability about him. Instead of being cool, calm and emotionless when under scrutiny he starts stuttering, mumbling his words, avoiding eye contact etc which are traits your average Joe would exhibit under the same sort of pressure. His nervy performance mean you don't always feel the way you should feel about him. Add to all this the wonderful score by Bernard Herrman and you really do have one hell of a film here.

I originally rated this film with the perfect score when I last watched Psycho (which was before I started writing reviews). However, I had to knock a star off for the psychiatry report at the end - although it helps us gain an understanding of Norman's mind-set it went on for too long and for me tarnished the film slightly.. More so given the memorable ending prior to said psychiatry sequence.",9

16 July 2013,Best Psychological Thriller from the Master of Suspense! Pathbreaking for its Time...,"With an age of 60 years, and a book containing such violence and sexuality, when Hitchcock tried to make 'Psycho' in 1959, the people, the industry and the critics didn't expect anything to come out of it. Who could have guessed it would become one of his best and most ambitious works.

Personally, it's my favourite Hitchcock movie; it's a powerful and complex psychological thriller. The movie was path-breaking in so many ways, and completely transformed the thriller and mystery genres. Its foray into psychoanalysis, the killing of the leading lady halfway through the film, the voyeuristic camera angles/glimpses into the lives of the characters, and the sexuality on film; all these completely changed the face of cinema. And not to forget John L. Russell's cinematography and Bernard Herrmann's legendary background score which give the movie its tone and impact.

Janet Leigh is mesmerizing in her short, but brilliant, portrayal of Marion Crane. Anthony Perkins gives a heartwarming and powerful performance as the innkeeper Norman Bates.

How can I finish my review without mentioning the famous Shower sequence? Legend has it that the scene was filmed over 7 days, and features 77 different camera angles. The nudity and violence are merely suggested, and not actually shown, and there lies the actual beauty of the scene. And the shots shown are through the views of the killer and the victim, and not that of a third person. Other than this scene, there are many other memorable and brilliantly directed scenes in the movie, including the climatic twist and the exceptional ending. There are many such details which add to the magnificence of the film.

The movie still remains as one of the best suspense thrillers of all time. Hitchcock truly was... the Master of Suspense!",8
26 March 2022,Re-watched after about 50 years.,"Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. I say that in the context of it being made in 1960. I can see that lots of reviewers don't rate it well but I'm guessing they are probably younger people with a completely different viewpoint of movies which is to be expected. I saw it decades ago but as it popped up on TV recently I decided to record and watch it again. It was astonishing to see in 1960 and although I saw it some years later on TV it was still memorable. Now after all these years I just want to point out what I still perceive as the good points. Of course it's dated in many ways but my reasons for watching would be as follows. The overall eerie atmosphere that Hitchcock conjured up is soon apparent as we realise that Janet Leigh is not the clean cut personality she first appears. Her sense of guilt manifests in her car ride, exacerbated by being followed by a cop. I found her mesmerising, easily her best performance, her sense of anxiousness conveyed brilliantly. At that time Janet Leigh had to be one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood, at least I think so. When she drives up to the Bates Motel is when the chills start. Anthony Perkins, a brilliant actor of his time is Norman Bates, the owner of the motel, seems pleasant, friendly and very cooperative although we know immediately that something doesn't seem right as there are no other visitors, all twelve cabins are vacant. I hope I've written enough for anyone who hasn't seen this chiller yet, to want to take a peek to see what happens next, but watch in the spirit of when it was made in 1960. Ten stars.",10

After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
31 January 1999,Hitchcock's masterpiece is the greatest thriller of all time.,"Psycho is a movie with an incredible twist-turned plot that throws the audience's perspective of the film way out of proportion. It is Hitchcock's best, without a doubt. His nervous and jittery Norman Bates is outstanding. If you can guess the ending of this timeless classic, you are considered a genius in my opinion. I have watched this movie a number of times and still find it enjoyable to watch again and again, I also learn something new about the film every time I view it. Look for the various mentions of birds in the film (i.e. Marion Crane, stuffed birds). It is not a scary movie, so don't expect to be terrified of showers or of hotels-maybe this wasn't the case in 1960 though when the movie came out. It is more a thriller or a mystery, one that will still seem unsolved after you learn ""who done it"". #4 on my all time favorite list. It is excellence, 4 stars. -Jake Klim (jklim007@yahoo.com)

8 April 2021,An Unmatched Work by the Master of Suspense,"I was very disturbed to watch a recent discussion of this iconic suspense film by three Turner Classic Movie hosts who are recognized and qualified film scholars. While the entire focus of their discussion was gender identification and violence against women, only two of many important aspects of this work of art, they totally ignored the most essential elements of the film which have compelled me to watch it over and over again for the past 60 years. The film is exceptional because of (1) the overall direction of Alfred Hitchcock and his mastery of the suspense genre, as well as his remarkable ability to tell a story with stunning visual beauty, (2) the magnificent musical score of Bernard Hermann which, by itself, creates a level of tension unlike any other film score in my memory, (3) the superb acting of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in the critical lead roles as well as a few supporting cast members who very much impressed me, including Frank Albertson as the man whose stolen $40,000 sets the wheels rolling for all of the following action, and (4) for me, the startling design of the opening credits by Saul Bass, which, accompanied by Mr. Hermann's spine-chilling music, establishes a high level of uncertainty, if not terror, even before the movie actually begins.

Even though I was prohibited from seeing ""Psycho"" at age eleven when it first opened in 1960, I was soon on my way aboard the Number 8 bus to downtown Elizabeth NJ, where I spent many Saturday afternoons watching movies in any one of the city's four theatres. On this occasion, I travelled alone so that there would be no blabbermouth witnesses.

Subsequent viewings will never reach the level of terror as that initial session in 1960 when I was scared out of my wits. I will also state that the level of tension and fear established so well by the director in the first half is not sustained by a much less eventful, far less gripping second half.

After many viewings, I never tire of the superb performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Although Leigh only appears during the first thirty minutes, she plays a seriously conflicted and even tormented Marion Crane to perfection, especially when Marion is painfully obliged to wear a calm and impassive face to the public. Apparently, Perkins' acting career fell victim to his own success here as his depiction of Norman Bates was so legendary that he could no longer be easily identified by audiences as anyone else.

The one major flaw for me is Simon Oakland's awkward and totally unnecessary monologue at the end, which served to spoil an otherwise excellent movie. While I didn't understand a word of it at the age of eleven, it still annoys me more than sixty years later. Norman seated in the padded cell with mother's very creepy voiceover and the superimposition of Mama's hideous image over his face at the last instant doesn't require Oakland's tedious and very confusing explanation at all. A picture says a thousand words if it is presented properly. What makes the ending even worse is the psychiatrist's odd gleefulness as he confirms Marion's tragic fate to Sam and Lila. Although I never allowed this awkward ending to ruin the rest of an extraordinary film, it proves that even Alfred Hitchcock isn't perfect as the pedantic and pompous psychiatrist should have been left on the cutting floor where he belonged.",9
4 August 1999,Hitchcock at his best,"A brilliant film. It still scares people today. This movie has Hitchcock's signature all over it. No one else could have done it. Suspense from start to finish. One of the finest,if not the finest,horror movie ever made.

26 March 2023,Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' continues to shock and amaze audiences over 60 years later,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is a timeless classic that has forever changed the horror genre. Released in 1960, it remains one of the most iconic and influential films in cinema history. The film tells the story of Marion Crane, who steals money from her employer and ends up at the Bates Motel, owned by the reclusive Norman Bates. The film's infamous shower scene has become one of the most iconic moments in film history, and the movie's twist ending continues to shock and amaze audiences.

Hitchcock masterfully builds tension and suspense throughout the film, using a combination of music, camera angles, and editing techniques to keep the audience on edge. The performances by the cast, particularly Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, are outstanding and help to elevate the film to a true masterpiece.

One of the most notable aspects of ""Psycho"" is the way it subverts audience expectations. The film was marketed as a typical horror movie, but Hitchcock defied conventions by killing off the main character halfway through the film and revealing the true villain in a shocking twist. This willingness to take risks and break the rules is what sets ""Psycho"" apart from other horror films of its time and makes it a true classic.

Overall, ""Psycho"" is a must-see film for anyone who loves horror, suspense, or classic cinema. It remains just as thrilling and effective today as it was over 60 years ago. Hitchcock's skillful direction and the standout performances by the cast make this film a true masterpiece.",10
13 June 2021,"If there's a 10 star movie, this would be it.","This has gotta be my favorite Hitchcock movie. Something timeless oozes from this movie - unlike Vertigo, the other movie which Hitchcock made which just about every film afterwards has taken at least -something- from, Psycho does not feel dated, keeps you guessing in all of the important ways.

I wish more films tried to do what this film did, instead of trying to be what it was.

3 April 2014,Souled Out,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects.

12 October 1998,a masterpiece of audience manipulation,"Psycho is one of the great movies because of the way it manipulates the audience. Everybody these days has at least an idea of who Norman Bates really is and what he does, but the movie still has the power to fascinate and to induce terror no less than poor Miss Crane's. The use of amazing photography and lighting schemes, the classic score, the ""McGuffin"" of the stolen money, and captivating performances by all actors (especially Janet Leigh and, famously and typecasting-ly, Anthony Perkins) add to the mix, pushing the audience's emotions one way and then another: tension, humour, humanity, terror, confusion, and a final horror. Ultimately, it is a visceral but above all highly entertaining experience.

8 March 2022,"""Is your time so empty?""","Psycho is a very strong, suspenseful film. Despite it being 60 years old it's still engageable, and fun to watch. And of course, it features the famous shower scene, which holds up pretty well, mainly due to the violin score in the background. Norman Bates as a villain is very disturbing, and the twist is sure to send chills down one's spine.

10 February 1999,The best of the best,"""Psycho"" is one of the few horror movies that have actually scared me. Even against such movies as ""The Exorcist"" and ""Poltergeist"", this one is the best of the best.

Even for a film shot in 1960 and entirely in black and white, the movie's lighting and cinematography are brilliant. This film invented shots that are used today and some that lesser-skilled directors just don't know how to use. (The contrast of Detective Arbogast against the house as he walks up the steps.)

The shower scene was good, but some other scenes were even better. When Detective Arbogast is attacked at the top of the steps, you really don't expect it.

So, just as a word of caution, don't try to take a shower after seeing this film.

8 May 2019,He Wouldn't Even Hurt A Fly,"Hitchcock's best film. A masterpiece of it's genre. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, score and acting. The plot revolves around a secretary who steals are large sum of money and hits the road on the lamb. She avoids police by taking back roads which lands her at the run down Bates Motel. Once there she encounters the curiously weird proprietor Norman. From that point the thrills and chills begin. The plot is chilling, creepy, dark, horrific and has a one of a kind fantastic twist ending. The film has many creepy scenes and the shower scene is still spine tingling and timeless. Anthony Perkin's stare and monologue at the end of the film is ingrained in my memory decades after I first started back into it. Both remain two of the most horrific moments ever captured on film. This is a masterful work of art and still evokes screams and terrible dreams from first time viewers. It remains one of the very best films ever in it's genre.

19 February 2020,A horror gem,"Such a brilliant film with wonderful acting and full of quirkiness. The ending is a complete plot twist that makes this a true horror. I can't praise it enough. The audio is fantastic and proves superiority to newer age films, you can hear everything and it's intensely satisfying. I don't want to spoil this but it's more than worth a watch for fans of psychological thrillers.

Definitely watching the sequel.

17 August 2000,A different kind of fear,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece does not instill fear in you like the modern horror flicks (using shock tactics), but instead subtly introduces it to you throughout the film. This might be because of the industry rules at that time as well, since violence that is too overt wasn't tolerated then. But only Hitchcock can use the rules then to construct a masterpiece, that even now, can cause that lingering fear to creep up on you.

I enjoyed the Norman Bates portrayed by Perkins - he is the original and will always be the best Norman Bates there is. The use of 'scary' imagery - spooky house on top of a hill sihouletted by lightning behind, etc...some call it crude, but in Hitchcock's hands, it is dynamite.

Rent it if you've never watched the original (you haven't?!?!), you won't regret it.

29 January 1999,We all go a little mad sometimes.,"Can anyone not be frightened by this masterpiece? It's being almost 40 years since the release of this Hitchcock classic, and it's still scary. And it's not just scary, it's also revolutionary and intelligent, like no one else can do. Alfred Hitchcock gives us a perfect technical motion picture, in the camera movements, cinematography, editing (how can you not get thrilled in the shower scene) and special effects, with a surprising and inspired screenplay, that keeps the viewer hypnotized the whole length of the film, a music score that matches the film perfectly, a display of the human experience, with greed, betrayal, sexuality, repression, morality, insanity, instinct, desire, violence, motherhood and passion, and outstanding performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, without mentioning the rest of the cast, which is great too. This is just a few comments on one of my top 5 films of all time, but now I gotta go. Need to take a shower.

19 December 1998,One of the scariest ever,"This movie is fabulous. Sadly, I haven't seen much of Hitchcock's other works (aside from the reruns on Nick-At-Nite.) so I cannot really compare.

The directing, acting, and everything else is fabulous. Hitchcock uses some of the best camera angles ever in filming this. The shower scene was filmed perfect and was very scary.

The end of it when ""Mother"" is discovered is so scary. You will never forget the end of it.

Anthony Perkins is truly scary. He has a feel to him that is just frightening.

The re-make is good but this is a classic.

The novel and re-make may be very good, but this classic surpasses them all.

25 September 2020,Horror that passed the test of time,"I don't think there's anything that hasn't been said about this movie yet. We all know the famous shower scene, we know the fact that chocolate syrup was used to imitate blood here and we're all so familiar with the wicked smirk our culprit gives at the end of the movie. I believe that nowadays most people know those things without even experiencing this movie. Yet what still makes it stand out and earns the movie it's place among all-time great movies?

I think the answer to that is the unique way this movie is able to shock you. You kind of expect what will happen because of small hints that are present in the dialogue and the background but even when it happens, you are left in shock, I can't really think of any other movie that has this quality. Usually you're left disappointed if the movie is too predictable. Not here. As I mentioned before, you kind of have the idea what will happen, you kind of are right but the expected actions still have enough shock factor to leave you speechless.",9

4 April 2020,great!!!,"The details are handled quite delicately, especially the contrast between the mother's room and the son's room. This film's use of several personalities and post-crime psychological trauma has a great impact on later generations. One episode of criminal psychology is also a murderous son who keeps his mother's remains until moldy.

10 July 2022,A Classic Thriller,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized.

25 January 2002,A timeless scare!,"I saw ""Psycho"" the first time as a teenager more than twenty years ago and was scared to death. Though this b/w psycho thriller was nearly 20 years old at that time and it was the high time for splatter and zombie movies with much more graphic violence, this movie used to scare me more than any fashionable slasher film. Everything from the heroine's escape, the dark Bates' house, the murder scenes (especially the one in the shower) and the investigations of the Bates' mystery never left my mind again. The sister of a friend of mine even couldn't use the shower anymore for several weeks and used her bathtub instead after having seen this movie...

Now 20 more years have passed, and I just saw this classic again for the tenth (?) time? I don't know... but it's still very scary to me, and even if you know that Anthony Perkins, wearing a wig an old dress, is coming into the bathroom you will still bite your nails during this scene... ""Psycho"" is purest art - it's a timeless scare that will also fright and thrill the next generations of movie watchers. Excellent!",10

28 August 2019,Classic horror movie,"I feel as though horror movies today are more slasher films then actual horror movies like the works of Alfred Hitchcock's psycho. Watched it, enjoyed it and I feel spoiled by today's horror genre... this feels kinda flat. But looking at it for what it is... suspenseful and creepy! It's a masterpiece of that era, not in the modern era sadly! Alfred Hitchcock in my opinion, is like Steven Spielberg of horror films because he started a trend and change in the genre! I would recommend it as a neat looking back at how movies use to be done!

11 January 2021,A Masterpiece In Every Way!,"Overall, Psycho is an absolute masterpiece. It has become an essential watch for anyone as it has become such a huge classic since its release in 1960. Hitchcock's direction is masterful throughout and the film never puts a foot wrong. He really did mean it when he said, ""The audience need to suffer as much as possible"". Performances, writing, editing all culminate to make one of the finest films ever made. A great film, if you haven't seen it, go treat yourself!

27 August 2001,Calling it a masterpiece is an euphemism.,"One of the few gems that would deserve more than the simple 10!It's the finest thriller of all times,but it's not only a thriller:it's everything:a psychological drama,a -monstrous- love film,a road movie-in its first part-,a psychopathology study,an update of those novels of the nineteenth century in which you take your life in your hands when you enter an isolated inn.All this and so much more.

Indeed so horrendous were the chances taken by Hitchcock on this movie that,with any lesser skill,the result could have been disastrous;think of it: the heroine disappears halfway through the movie ,leaving the spectator an orphan,or Tom Thumb in the threatening forest;one third of the movie features no dialogue at all;it was a shoestring budget because nobody but the Master and his close collaborators like Herrmann believed in such a project.

Bernard Herrmann outdoes himself for the absolutely perfect soundtrack.His work is so haunting,so mesmerizing that it was imitated to death,when it was not simply used as it was in countless plagiarisms.(DePalma's ""Dressed to kill"" is a good example)

Pushing his innovations forwards,the Master,after having used in ""the rope"",only 11 shots for the whole movie,reverses his strategy:70 in the 45 seconds shower scene.

Nothing of the plot should be revealed.Everything you would say would be a spoiler.I'm sure that I've already said too much of it.Just enjoy.",10
26 March 2020,It's not just blood that is called violence,"The script and the details are absolutely amazing, and the understanding of gender is especially advanced. The director's thinking and unique camera movement aggravate the portrayal of details. Its metaphors are also worth recalling. The skull at the end is more than chilling.

26 August 2023,Anthony Perkins and His Evil Smile😊,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho from 1960 is one of the most iconic horror movies of all time, so now it was my time to watch it. For a movie from back then, this is perfect. You imagine the things that you can see, you discover the mental illusion of a psychopathic man, and the suspense is so suspenseful! It holds you from the beginning to the end, every piece went one by one, and in the end we got the full picture.

Psycho offers us a psychological mystery mixed with a horror like thriller, some violence scenes, but the whole thing is about the psychopath. The music by Bernard Herrmann was so great, it fitted the movie perfectly, with some other known melodies and symphonies, for example from Beethoven. The pictures and the camera shots where fantastic, in the violence scenes, we couldn't see everything clear, so you had to imagine some of the parts, what made the movie more exciting and interesting.

The actors were great, all of them, and my personal favourite was Anthony Perkins as the main antagonist in Psycho, Norman Bates. His sharm and his terrifying smile, made him the perfect Psycho, he played so realistic and with nature and feeling. The rest of the cast made their job too as the protagonists. The whole confusion about Norman Bates thinking and perspective was something that was so surprising and very original, such a story too make, really, no one make movies like that anymore. Alfred Hitchcock succeeded in the making of Psycho. If you want to see a classic horror movie, this one most be watched. Great opportunity to discover more of Alfred Hitchcock movie world, but for now, I am going to sleep😴

Perhaps I meet Norman on the way😱 Please be careful which Motel you are going to sleep in, and make the right choose, please. Remember too lock your bathroom.",10

18 February 2005,"For what it is, Psycho pretty much is a perfect film.","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
1 July 2001,Remarkable.,"When Saul Bass' opening credits begin to roll (combined with Bernard Herrmann's legendary score), you know you're in for a treat. However, the first half an hour of ""Psycho"" can get slightly tedious as it mostly consists of Janet Leigh driving a car. But as soon as she reaches The Bates Motel, the atmosphere increases to an electrifying level.

""Psycho"" made an enormous impression on me the first time I saw it (I was just 12). Luckily I had no idea about the twist in the end because it would have ruined the whole thing. Although the movie relies much on Hitchcock's innovative use of clever camera angles, its greatest asset is Anthony Perkins' outstanding performance that simply cannot be praised enough.

As some others have pointed out, the casting of John Gavin as Leigh's boyfriend was a terrible choice, but I believe Hitchcock wasn't very pleased with him either. Gavin's practically nonexistent screen appeal reminds me of those anemic actors in ""Strangers on a Train"". Can't believe he was to become the new James Bond until Sean Connery was lured back, thankfully!

Regardless of that minor flaw, ""Psycho"" has earned its status in the history of cinema. It's a remarkable achievement within Hitchcock's career and an impressive work of art whose impact multiple viewings can't wear off.",10
12 August 1999,Why Anthony Perkins wasn't nominated for Oscar,"I watched this movie because someone said it is Hitch's best. I haven't watched all of his movies, so I can't say if it is his best or not. However, it is a really good movie, mostly because of the great performance of 'Norman Bates'. I don't understand why somebody will consider his performance as dry or dull. His performance is fabulous! It was so scary when you saw him having that evil smile on his face, in the dark when he just said goodbye to Marion. You know there's something wrong with him but you don't know what will happen next. You can guess he's probably the murderer but don't know why. The ending is quite surprising. I like the ending. Very special. Not something we'll see these days. Highly recommend.

5 April 2014,Horror Fans Who Consider themselves 'Horror Fans' and haven't seen this movie shouldn't consider themselves horror fans.,"Psycho is a film that marks its place in movie history. From beginning to end, you are focused, listening to every word they say. But when stuff goes down, you are hiding behind your blanket, trying to protect yourself from what you're about to see. Yeah, it's from the 1960's, but this isn't like a 1960's horror movie. The film is thrilling and violent, but most of all, it's entertaining from beginning to end. With a killer soundtrack, it's no wonder you jump out of your seat when something surprising happens. And, yes. The twist ending is the father of twist endings. It's great. Long story short, see this movie. I recommend it to everyone reading this, and everyone not reading this, still see the movie. It's really good.

1 November 2004,Timeless Thriller,"Psycho is an excellent thriller no horror fan should miss. Alfred Hitchcock knows how to create chills without gore. The film being in black and white also adds to the spooky mystique. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are perfectly cast. Leigh's character makes you sympathetic for her despite her criminal intentions and Perkins' portrayal of a serial killer ensnaring his prey is brilliant. I can't imagine why this film was remade in the 1990's --- the 1960 version is just so perfect that I wouldn't change a thing.

Overall I recommend this film. It's so good you'll want to watch it twice in a row.

1 November 2018,Quite the flickaroo.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
3 August 2006,Too unconvincing to be true,"I never was a great Hitchcock fan and this movie did nothing to change my mind. It's indisputable that he makes very good movies from the formal-technical point of view and that he knows how to create a suspense and (or) horror atmosphere with great mastery and skillfulness but the stories he tells us are too fanciful to be real (despite the fact that they are presented as real)and when he dives into the psychological pathology of his characters he becomes much unconvincing. For instance in this movie the psychiatrist's explanation which takes place in the final scene doesn't seem to me to have great scientific rigor, looking more like pure fantasy. Nevertheless it's true indeed that this movie (like others he has made) keeps us stuck to our seats and wrapped up in the story unfolding from the first to the last scene. Only later and after the movie ends do we emerge from that spell to realize that all that has very little juice in terms of psychological reality. This movie has however also a remarkable feature in the performance of the great actor who is Anthony Perkins who makes and excellent character very well adapted to the role that the movie's director gave him and with great and talented sobriety.",6
29 June 2020,Sleight Of Hand...,"With PSYCHO, Director Alfred Hitchcock reaches into his black bag of tricks and creates a masterful show of misdirection. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) appears to be our main character, embezzling big money from her own company, and hitting the road.

We believe we are to follow her, to see if she gets away with her crime, or gets caught. We think that it's the police she has to worry about. Once Marion checks into the Bates Motel, we feel like the cops are out there, and a knock could come any second, ending her impulsive folly.

Of course, we're wrong.

Hitchcock has something far more sinister than a simple crime drama up his sleeve. What we imagined to be true... isn't. By the time the smoke clears, we realize we've been bamboozled, and everything shifts into suspense / thriller territory.

A new character named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) takes the stage, leaving us slack-jawed. His seemingly gentle nature is belied by something just below the surface. His towering house, and his mother are all he has. However, nothing is as it appears to be. By the time Marion's sister, Lila (Vera Miles) gets involved, we fear for her as well, not knowing what to expect. The ensuing mystery leads to further jolts, and the incredible finale.

Audiences who first witnessed this film had no idea what might occur. It helps to put our modern jadedness aside, and watch through less cynical eyes. Context is everything with a classic such as this. Pretend you're in a dark theater in 1960, having never even heard of a movie like this, and let the magic show unfold...",
22 September 2022,No wonder it's a classic,"If you've never seen Psycho, you either don't like movies or Alfred Hitchcock. As you might know from watching the making-of movie Hitchcock, there's a host of trivia behind the scenes of the Psycho set. From Janet Leigh's ample bosom that could barely be contained in the frame (or could it), to Hitchcock's control of his audience (from not letting them into the theater late, to specifically asking them to keep the plot to themselves), it's understandable why it was such a smash hit. Dark, gritty true crime movies weren't made very often - but they had been made. The previous year's Compulsion, starring Dean Stockwell, fit into that genre and was a precursor to the senseless crime spree of Bonnie & Clyde.

While everyone would argue that Psycho ruined Anthony Perkins's career, not everyone feels that way. I actually have a friend who has never seen Psycho, and she doesn't think of Anthony Perkins the way the rest of the world does. She always calls him ""the handsome actor who sings Stephen Sondheim songs"" - I'm not kidding. But the rest of world remembers him transitioning from the sweet, nonviolent Quaker from Friendly Persuasion to Norman Bates four years later and never looking back. If you're looking for it, though, you can find a sprinkling of roles in his post-1960 career that weren't villains: Catch-22, Lovin' Molly, and Goodbye, Again.

What I love most about this classic thriller is Bernard Herrmann's music. Like the greatest of themes, it sounds exactly like what it's describing. You can tell what the movie is about by just listening to the score. You hear the knife, the scream, the heartbeat, and the inner-workings of the psychotic mind. But for non-music fans, there's a lot more to love about it. The iconic Bates Motel setting, Hitchcock's careful directing, Perkins' subtle performance, and the overall creepiness that lingers in the air. It's no wonder this is a classic.",8
10 June 2022,Classic,"Nowadays Psycho might be seen as a not so special movie because most people know the famous plot twist even without watching it. But when it was released it was very inovative,serial killer movies weren't as popular in the 60's as they were in the late 70's and 80's. Psycho gave birth to the slasher genre,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween in the late 70's, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on elm Street in the 80's,all these titles were heavly influenced by Psycho. The movie still holds up very well,mainly because of Anthony Perkins amazing acting as Norman Bates,it's worth watching for it's influence on slasher and thriller/horror in general.

18 May 1999,One of the best horror movies I have seen.,"Let's face it, Alfred Hitchcock was a genius! He managed to capture the true demented character of Norman Bates. In the 90's Psycho does not seem to be one of the scariest movies around. But the way Hitchock managed the lighting and camera angles, made it so obvious why this movie became such a hit. I just saw this movie a few months ago, and even then, everyone I watched it with seemed delighted to scream again at the geinius of Alfred Hitchcock.

24 August 2023,Excellent,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is a landmark in the horror genre, known for its masterful suspense-building techniques and its lasting impact on the way horror films are crafted. The film skillfully merges psychological thriller elements with horror, creating an atmosphere of unease and tension that lingers long after the credits roll.

The story follows Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, who steals money and ends up at the Bates Motel, run by the mysterious Norman Bates, portrayed by Anthony Perkins. What initially appears to be a straightforward plot takes a dark and unsettling turn as secrets about the Bates family and the motel's eerie surroundings are gradually revealed.

Hitchcock's direction is a masterclass in suspense, with each scene meticulously constructed to manipulate the audience's emotions. The famous shower scene is a prime example of his ability to create terror through suggestion and editing, as opposed to explicit gore.

Anthony Perkins delivers a haunting performance as Norman Bates, exuding an eerie combination of charm and instability. The character's psychological complexity is central to the film's power, as audiences are left to grapple with the blurred lines between victim and villain.

The film's iconic score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, contributes significantly to its atmosphere. The shrieking violin strings in the shower scene have become synonymous with horror itself, emphasizing the film's ability to evoke fear through both visuals and sound.

""Psycho"" is celebrated for its groundbreaking narrative twists and psychological exploration. It delves into themes of identity, duality, and the nature of evil, all while keeping audiences on the edge of their seats with its unpredictable storytelling.

The black-and-white cinematography, stark visuals, and stark lighting enhance the film's chilling mood. The Bates Motel and the unsettling Norman Bates house have become enduring symbols of horror cinema.

In conclusion, ""Psycho"" is a hallmark of the horror genre that continues to captivate and disturb audiences. Its innovative storytelling, psychological depth, and Hitchcock's expert direction have cemented its status as a classic. Whether you're a fan of horror or cinema history, ""Psycho"" remains a must-watch film that has left an indelible mark on the world of movies.",9
16 July 2009,"Through ugliness, beauty is achieved","One would expect little from a film like this. In it, a psychopath murders people. It's pretty much as simple as that. There's back-story, of course, and the characters are three-dimensional, but otherwise, this is the typical thriller. However, it sets the standards for all thrillers to come after it. The exaggerated murder scenes and the music are two of the most copied horror techniques I have ever seen, and they originated in this film, and only in this film are they artistic. What sets this film apart from others in its genre is the fact that it is not all massacre. There's more suspense than anything else; impending doom. The murderer is not even the central character. A series of strokes of bad judgment from Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), the character who really stokes the fires, sparks a sinister chain of events. The people this chain of events involves are performed in such a way that they are real people thrust into a frightening situation, all strung together by the dark, confused thoughts of the title character, of the psycho. Interesting and masterful. Ten out of ten.

20 September 2020,First seen on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in February 1972,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" may well be the greatest motion picture ever made, certainly the best film that ever popped up on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater during a time when availability was mostly left to the bottom half of drive-in double bills. Robert Bloch's original 1959 novel was inspired by the real life horrors perpetrated by Wisconsin necrophile Ed Gein, kidnapping his mother's corpse to care for it and despoiling other graves for food or souvenirs (Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" expertly conveyed the sickening atmosphere of such depravity). In refashioning this normal looking, unsuspected farmer into Norman Bates, balding, alcoholic, middle aged proprietor of the Bates Motel built by his mother, the same events play out as in Hitchcock's adaptation, though despite living only 35 miles from Gein's hometown of Plainfield Bloch remained unaware of the actual crimes until it was almost completed (he was amazed at how similar the dynamic turned out to be living out in the country, a puritanical religious fanatic mother whose son acted out in much the same way as his fictional counterpart). Hitchcock purchased the rights for a pittance in an attempt to go against his recent history of big budget efforts with major stars for a small scale black and white production done by his television arm Shamley, apparently inspired by showman filmmaker William Castle. His chosen screenwriter was Joseph Stefano, listening intently to the director's changes with surprise and delight, shifting the initial focus not on Norman but on fugitive Marion Crane, in possession of $40,000 stolen to pay off her fiancee's debts so that they can marry. All Hitchcock had to do was suggest Anthony Perkins for Norman to engage the audience's sympathy, the up and coming 27 year old actor had already been nominated for an Oscar for only his second screen role in ""Friendly Persuasion,"" while casting Janet Leigh as Marion was even better, a lovely and versatile actress whose star qualities could carry the crucial early section and pull the viewers into her 'private trap' (she lost the Academy Award for Best Actress but did win a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress). Another masterstroke was personally appearing on all the posters with strict guidelines on how the film should be exhibited, no one to be admitted after the picture's start: ""I realize this is a revolutionary concept but we have discovered that PSYCHO is unlike most pictures and does not improve when run backwards!"" Topping that had to be the best tagline ever conceived: ""don't give away the ending, it's the only one we have!"" Filmed on the Universal backlot, where the Bates motel would be seen in several episodes of Boris Karloff's THRILLER, it was a reluctant pickup for Paramount to finish off a previous contract (put off by the violence and adult subject matter), not expecting much of a return under Hitchcock's restrictions and no advance screenings yet becoming the biggest blockbuster of his entire career from massive ballyhoo and word of mouth. He wanted to prove that a relatively minor feature from William Castle could have turned out much better with a decent director on a small investment, and in playing the audience like a piano succeeded beyond his wildest dreams...but where do you go from here? Transforming something perfectly ordinary into something terrifying was a challenge he always enjoyed, and would meet with ""The Birds."" And believe it or not, William Castle himself described his latest plot to screenwriter Robb White, who deemed ""Homicidal"" fairly impressive until he went to see ""Psycho"" and realized that this 'original' idea was a complete ripoff! John Gavin had not seen the last of the Bates Motel, both appearing in the very last episode of THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR in 1965, ""Off Season,"" directed by a young William Friedkin and scripted by none other than Robert Bloch.",10
17 December 2021,Oh! What tension is this!,"Maybe the story is a short one but a tight well written one, the end was very reasonable good; I liked it in total, I think no movie make you full focused all the time as that one did.

17 July 1999,Hitchcock. Need I say more?,"Psycho is like a fine wine. It only gets better with age. Hitchcock at his best. The master of suspense brings the master of all films to the big screen. The plot, the script, the actors, and the direction is great. Psycho brings the future of psychological warfare to a boiling point. This movie has been imitated but never duplicated many times over. This movie is one of a kind and should always be cherished.

14 December 2019,One of Hitchcock's Best,"Psycho is a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, the suspense and thrill I felt watching this movie was great. This film has great suspense while not going into the horror genre. The editing and camera cuts to different angles really builds the suspense. This music used in the film really deepens the eerie feeling you get while watching. This movie shows Hitchcock at his finest, the shower scene is now iconic and the twists and turns in the plot make this movie unpredictable in the best way.

20 January 2008,It still has its power as it did in 1960,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially.

We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
28 February 2021,The classic of classics,"This is a gift from the 60s, beautifully put together and to this day a brilliant, surprising film. Of course, it was based on a book, but Hitchcock's brilliance comes from the ability to turn the book into a cinematic masterpiece. This is a must-see for every horror fan because Perkins' performance sets the standard for all the psychopaths portrayed in cinema: Nicholson as Jack Torrance, Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, Bale as Patrick Bateman, it all starts with him. An absolute classic with the best plot twist in history.

14 March 2003,"For better or worse, slasher movies would not exist today without this movie.","(***** out of *****) This is, more or less, the original slasher film, and, in spite of some unfortunate aging, it's one of the scariest and most manipulative thrillers of all time. Janet Leigh plays a secretary on the run after embezzling money from her boss. After a narrow escape from the law, she winds up at the run-down Bates Motel (and she was afraid of prison!) At this point, the movie takes a detour from its rather-tame opening half hour and takes viewers on a frightening ride of murder, madness, nagging mothers, stuffed birds, skeletons in cellars and ill-fated showers. Hitchcock's direction is top-notch, and the editing during the murder scenes is almost as schizophrenic as the title character. The only part that doesn't work quite so well anymore is the needlessly extended epilogue sequence, where a psychiatrist gives us all a lengthy explanation about split personalities and transvestism. But, otherwise, this should be studied as a textbook on how to make a horror film -- make the audience uncomfortable and uncertain, then gradually reduce their expectations and get them relaxed again, and then -- WHAM! -- knock them over the head with the flat side of an ax. Anthony Perkins (unsettlingly brilliant here, but forever-after typecast), as mama's boy Norman Bates, is the original, cinematic psycho killer and Leigh is the original scream queen. Also stars Vera Miles as Leigh's suspicious sister, John Gavin as the concerned lover, and Martin Balsam as the too-snoopy-for-his-own-good detective on the case. Aside from the infamous and oft-duplicated shower scene, there are a number of shocking and suspenseful sequences, and all of it is punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's classic, frightening score. Based on Robert Bloch's novel, who loosely based his character on real-life serial killer Ed Gein.

HIGHLIGHT: The shower scene's too obvious, so I'll throw another one out here: The scene where Norman tries to get rid of a car with one of his victims inside by pushing it into a lake. This is a darkly clever scene, because, when the car initially refuses to sink, we feel an inexplicable pang of concern and sympathy for poor Norm, in spite of the grisly severity of his actions.",
19 December 2010,Hitch's best. One of the best and most memorable suspense thrillers in film history. Well liked for the famous shower scene.,"""Psycho"" is without a doubt a classic film a suspense thriller that ranks well in memory it impacted cinema and pop culture it's a film that ranks as iconic history. When I first saw it I was even afraid to take showers as a kid! As the famous shower scene impacted me that much, and many people even had a phobia of staying in a motel after seeing this film classic. Later thru the years after countless viewings I adjusted and saw every moment of the film as pleasure as after I learned how the shower scene was shot I learned to appreciate cinema history and the techniques of how the shower scene was shot with superior montage editing.

Alfred Hitchcock the master of thriller suspense had it all in ""Psycho"" the many themes present are lust, sex, embezzlement, greed, secrets, taxidermy, voyeurism, and a split personality which caused someone to cross dress as their dead mother! Aside from that the shower shower scene is memorable one of the most famous in film history and combined with the performances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, ""Psycho"" is a memorable classic that a viewer can't get enough of.

Set in Arizona it begins with Marion Crane(played so beautiful and very elegantly sexy by Janet Leigh a 60's screen siren. Plus it was a real treat to see Janet undress and sport that sexy black bra!)a woman who as a lonely secretary only has a hobby of being a sexy and elegant seducer of her boyfriend a man who's divorced. And Marion wants escape so one Friday afternoon after returning from lunch break when she receives a payment for her boss from a rich oil business man an ideal is sprung to mind. Marion will leave town only the money is not put in the bank it will take a journey ride with Marion to California. Interesting and very watchful along the way is the scenes of the deep voiced policeman who follows Marion a little distance, as I think Hitchcock used these scenes to show a viewer that Ms. Crane felt guilt about her exit.

Only one rainy evening in California she drives upon the lonely Bates motel and this place feels different as it's clearly not what it seems. Attending is Norman Bates(wonderfully done and over the top by Anthony Perkins) who's a strange guy a shut in who tends to his old sick mother(supposedly)and Norman has a hobby of collecting dead birds! As he talks and checks Ms. Crane in Norman seems normal, yet he's anything but. Then shocking is when Marion gets settled in she tries to unwind and chill with a hot shower, only this is one shower that will spray out a sliced up death as it will become a blood bath! As Marion will clearly have her secrets washed away in blood.

Many don't know the shower scene was shot from seventy different camera positions. As the montage editing is fantastic as the way the shots were linked together showing a certain form of art. This was adapted from the Soviet Union from the classic director Eisenstein as the clashing of images is graphic as it matches the film's shower scene so well. As each clashing scene the knife is shown going back and fourth from Leigh's body the images clash with blood showing the graphic side of life as this film has a bloody form of art. And most telling and chilling is the final shot when Janet falls as the blood drips down the tub drain showing her dead the drain symbolizes her life has indeed went down the drain! Really this is one scene I can go on and on about as if you know and study film their is always something you can find that the shower scene symbolizes and links to life and a graphic form of death. The scene was just so brilliant.

So did Norman do it or was it mad mother who knows as Hitchcock tries to keep it a little suspenseful. Only you the viewer know the real shock poor Norman is a dressed up guy having a thing for women's wardrobe! Overall great suspense thriller classic from Alfred it proves we all have the right to go a little mad. It proves that you can't run from and hide your secrets. And when you arrive in a strange place you never know what to expect, as hidden secrets are present and they might just be stranger than yours just even mad and crazy! ""Psycho"" is one of the best films ever made.",10
21 August 1999,Wish I could've seen this in '60,"I hate that I knew about the shower scene before I ever saw the movie. I hate that I went in thinking it's a movie about Anthony Perkins/Norman Bates instead of Janet Leigh/Marion Crane. But even knowing what I did when I first saw it didn't take away too much from this masterpiece.

Norman Bates, ever the victim, cleaning up after his mother's misdeeds. What great acting by Perkins. His delivery of such lines as ""We all go a little mad sometimes... Haven't you?"" with the chuckle in the middle. The look on his face when that car wasn't going to sink all the way. The way Arbogast had him flustered and his mother almost came out, ""I'm not a fool and I'm not capable of being fooled... Maybe she fooled me but she didn't fool my mother!"" What a great line that was anyway.

Someone suggested that Vince Vaughan did a better job in the '98 version of Psycho. Oh no. No no no no no. In the original you really believe Norman Bates is an innocent victim. You're really kind of hoping he'll pull it off. No way he could've killed the girl. Vince Vaughan himself looks like a murderer.

This movie gets a big fat 10 from me.",10
6 August 2013,PSYCHO is nearly a perfect movie . . .,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
1 October 2015,"A Terrifying Horror Film, and A Compositional Masterpiece","Psycho is a classic horror film, directed by ""The Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock. Chosen to be shot in black-and-white rather than color, the tone is often terrifying, and the acting is chilling as well. The film is loaded with symbolism, and terrific composition that is just subtle enough to not give away the plot, but tells an educated audience member everything they need to know from a single frame.

Psycho benefits from masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, who embodies what is considered perfect mise en scene, by making almost every object in frame important in some way. The composition of the film is extremely dense, whether it be symbolic, or narratively relevant, almost every frame is crucial for the film. A great example of this is the parlor scene, in which we see Norman Bates invite Marion into his parlor. One could argue the plot of the rest of the film is told through symbolism, and composition. In the scene the composition very heavily foreshadows the coming events of the film, as we see predatory birds and predatory sexualized paintings in the parlor, concurrent with Norman. As the audience sees a large Owl, in attacking position, on eye level with Norman, the meaning is clear. This composition is consistently used throughout the scene. Another example is Marion is usually in camera with ravens, very clearly foreshadowing her fate. It's this dense and brilliant composition that makes Psycho a great example of Alfred Hitchcock's genius. Another thing that is evident throughout the film is Hitchcock's style, whether it be his obsession with birds, his love of particular shots, or his undeniable voyeuristic use of the camera. Composition is the director's most direct route into the mind of the audience, if one knows what to look for they can learn about a director from his composition. What we see is Hitchcock likes shots that feel as if the audience is looking at the characters through something, whether it be a windshield, window, or hole in the wall. Using these shots Hitchcock almost makes the camera feel like another person viewing the film. It's the use of voyeuristic shots, and the attempt to make the camera feel like another character that subtly brings the audience to Norman Bate's level, at one point we even see shots from his perspective. I suspect this was done to muddle the message of who is right, and who is wrong, because the audience is both off put with the creepiness of Norman, but is also lead to be sympathetic. In essence Hitchcock makes a movie where we see no truly good characters, but no truly bad characters either. In the end Hitchcock created a masterful horror film that could still stand as one of the best all time. The black-and-white color, dense composition, and uneasy score make Psycho all the more terrifying. All-the-while setting the standard for how filmmakers would develop characters for years to come.",9
4 August 2015,One of the most thrilling titles ever made.,"I suppose it's quite peculiar that I only saw 'Psycho' after seeing around a dozen other Hitchcock titles, given that it's his best- known film. As I pressed 'play', I made the mistake of assuming that it'd just be a seminal slasher film, lacking the complexity of other Hitchcock titles such as 'Rebecca' and 'Vertigo'. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. The score was perfect, and I'm not just talking about the piercing shrieks of the legendary shower scene. It remains amongst the most iconic in cinema, and is just as foreboding as John Williams' score for 'Jaws'. Another winning feature of Hitchcock's horror is the excellent acting. I hadn't heard much about Anthony Perkins prior to watching 'Psycho', and so I was sceptical as to how he could portray a villain as iconic as Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader. His acting talents shine from the first scene in which he appears, though, and Perkins delivers a truly outstanding performance as the crazed motel manager, Norman Bates. The performances of Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and the other actors in 'Psycho' are just as good as Perkins'.

The twists and plot developments delivered in the film are similarly brilliant. After the shower scene, I wasn't sure that the film could surprise me or really offer me much, but I was – once again – surprised. The level of danger perceived in 'Psycho' is much greater than that in many other Hitchcock titles, and I never thought that a 55-year-old film could grip me like this did. The brilliant director's other titles were certainly thrilling, but the threats facing actors such as James Stewart, Joan Fontaine and Tippi Hedren seemed either relatively minor ('Rear Window'; 'Rebecca'), more intriguing than dangerous ('Vertigo'; 'Suspicion'), or even comical ('The Birds'). 'Psycho' could not be dismissed in this manner, and I found the plight of Vera Miles and Janet Leigh just as intense as Jodie Foster's in 'The Silence of the Lambs', if not more so. At points, Alfred Hitchcock's iconic horror was creepier than 'Rosemary's Baby' and more shocking than 'The Exorcist', and the director accomplishes this without delving into the supernatural or paranormal. I'd go so far as to say that this title is one of the greatest films ever produced, and it certainly ranks as my favourite Hitchcock title at the moment. Upon watching 'Psycho', you'll realise how even acclaimed thrillers such as 'Se7en' and 'Misery' pale into passivity.",10

13 September 2003,The one and only !,"Millions of movie reviews by respect critics as well as by ordinary film fans have confirmed this many times already: Psycho is a true masterpiece and one of the most influential and original horror stories ever shown. I have very few to add to that, except for the fact that I couldn't agree more with this status. I'm not a giant fan of Alfred Hitchcock but I do find that he deserves his title ""master of suspense"". If it were only for this movie alone. Psycho is the most important modern horror movie since it gave a whole new image to the character of the ""serial killer"". Norman Bates is frightening but there's always sympathy for him. He's the most influential horror icon without a doubt. I doubt that there're many people who don't now about the terrific climax by now. I've heard spoilers about this movie before I knew it even existed...But still, there are always surprises to discover and no matter how many times you see it you'll always be impressed.

Other than that, there isn't much to say about this milestone in cinema. Watch this movie if you haven't yet and don't go on calling yourself a cinema fan before you see it !! But, avoid the 1998 remake at all costs! Although there are a few decent actors in that ( William H.Macy, Julliane Moore and Viggo Mortensen ) it's a disgrace to Alfred Hitchcock and to everyone else who was involved with the original version",9

16 June 2009,A Milestone in the Thriller Genre,"Director : Alfred Hitchcock Cast : Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles

Undoubtedly the most popular movie created by the genius Hitchcock, Psycho is a masterpiece from all aspects of film making, be it the plot, screenplay, cinematography, sound and above all direction. It is a very intelligent thriller and keeps the viewer engaged and enthralled until the last frame.

The plot revolves around a highway motel and it's caretaker and owner Norman Bates, his sick and somewhat spooky mother, a woman who steals large amount of money from her employer to improve her love life with her boyfriend and who comes to stay at this Bates motel . The proceedings that follow are extremely interesting and enthralls the viewer. We get to see perhaps one of the best murder scenes ever shot in cinematic history, the famous shower murder of the lady who stays in the motel . The protagonist of the movie Norman Bates character has been very well written and performed by the actor concerned as well. Sometimes we as an audience feel pity and sorry for him and after knowing his mental condition, this feeling increases even more.

In short, Psycho is one of the milestones of this particular thriller genre. Many thriller movies either based on this or influenced by this have come in many large numbers, but the charm and the greatness of this particular movie will remain in the minds of cinema lovers for eternity.

12 September 2006,The greatest film ever made,"Hitchcock's greatest film, an adroit blend of grizzly horror, crazy pop psychology and clipped social satire, is about a girl called Marion Crane, (Janet Leigh in a career-defining performance), who takes the money (her employers) and runs all the way to the Bates motel where ... well, if you haven't seen it and really don't know the plot, I won't spoil it for you, suffice to say at which point it becomes a movie about a boy called Norman, (Anthony Perkins in one of the greatest pieces of screen acting ever; like Anthony Quinn's Zorba, Perkins was doomed to play Norman for ever more).

Dismissed by serious critics at the time, (for it's violence, for it's cheap, tawdry milieu - talk about pulp fiction - and for what they saw as Hitchcock's degeneration into what now would be dubbed the slasher movie genre), it is now widely regarded as a masterpiece, a brilliant fusion of technique and content, drawing us first into Marion's world, then dismissing her as fatuously as Antonioni did with his heroine in ""L'Avventura"", before creating in Norman one of the most multi-layered characters in all cinema and finally 'explaining' the whole plot in a totally audacious coda. Even without the shock element the film repays repeated viewings and was needlessly remade by Gus Van Sant, virtually frame by frame and in colour, and which should be avoided at all costs.",10

The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
12 May 2022,We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes,"Janet Leigh plays a bank teller who goes missing after she steals money. Her sister and boyfriend have to find out what happened to her which leads them to the Bates Motel which is run by a strange mother and son who have a few secrets of their own. A mid-film twist still packs a punch and Bernard Hermann's string heavy score will jangle your nerves.

22 July 2022,One of the Best Psychotic Thrillers,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree.

11 July 2002,GREAT movie,"One of the best marks of a movie is its staying power. And Psycho is most certainly one movie that has stood the test of time. It is still: 1. The most frightening horror movie 2. The best filmed horror movie 3. The best ACTED horror movie 4. The best directed horror movie. VERY FEW movies set the viewer up with one character as a setup for another even better character. But, Psycho did it, and did it well. Of course, everybody has heard about the ""shower"" scene. And, it was certainly something nobody had ever seen before. Today, it is considered very mild. But, that scene is only a small part of the movie. The rest is just good it is almost beyond words.

If you are one of the few people who has never seen this classic horror movie, do yourself a favor, and rent it.

3 May 2002,The great Hitchcock classic,"This movie STILL gives me chills. It is a great classic. Not just because of the horror of Mr. Bates, but because of the way it was made and the acting. Everything about this movie is good. The first time I saw it, I didn't know what to expect. I was just blown away.

18 January 2023,Psycho - THE Alfred Hitchcock Classic,"Alfred Hitchcock made many fine full features and TV shows during his illustrious career, but he is best-remembered for this film as being the pinnacle of his success. With stars Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, and Martin Balsam leading the way, the dialogue and scene by scene shots are legendary.

Hitchcock uses the power of suggestion, not gore, to horrify his viewers. Impending doom and fearful anticipation dominate his shots. He was not called the King of Suspense for no good reason. This tale of a female embezzler from Arizona on the run appears to be rather mundane at first, but we all know that Hitchcock has nothing to do with the mundane. Expect several good surprises.

27 July 2015,An Untouchable Masterpiece!!!,"When you are watching a great movie, it can be ascertained within the first few seconds itself. Psycho, is no exception to that rule, as it has influenced several genres of film and has been widely imitated yet no other movie has managed to replicate the staggering impact that it had.

A secretary steals $40000 and decides to run away. While escaping in her car, she has to stop for the night and retires to a secluded motel that is far away from the highway. Here, she encounters Norman Bates, the owner of the motel, who seems like a perfectly normal, charming person who has a cheerful demeanor.

The acting is phenomenal and the natural performances by everyone involved in this movie make it seem effortless. Alfred Hitchcock, who is regarded as one of the most influential directors ever, has shot this movie brilliantly and every shot, every scene seems like a crucial piece in the puzzle that this movie is.

Psycho would not have been nearly as effective if not for the haunting score composed by Bernard Hermann. The music that is played during the shower scene is one of the most recognizable and compelling pieces ever written. As the tone of the movie is rather mysterious, the score serves as an audio guide due to the ominous sounds that are played.

Psycho is a compelling, ingenious, and singular movie that has managed to push the boundaries of filmmaking and is one of the best movies that has ever been made. No amount of praise will be able to take away the magic of this movie which can only be experienced by viewing it.",10
16 June 2001,Forget about the crappy remakes,"Forget about the crappy remakes, no one does it better than Anthony Perkins. Although this movie is not filled with blood and gore, it does have a very chilling atomsphere, the prefect ingredient for a classic horror movie.

forget about cheesy run-of-the-mill horror movies such as Scream and Halloween this goes down as oneof the best horror movies of all time.

8 May 2014,A Hitchcock Masterpiece,"Psycho is the thriller film to compare all other horror/thrillers. It has literally everything you could possibly look for in a thriller. Suspense, a phenomenal soundtrack, glorious cinematography, shocking twists, it has it all.

Each scene in Psycho was created masterfully, from the into graphic to the ending dramatic monologue. To name a few aspects, the cop scene portrayed Hitchcock's fear of cops excellently, the shower scene terrified, and still terrifies it's viewers, and the iconic violins in the musical scores are simply flawless.

Psycho is a cinema classic. Anyone who (somehow) hasn't seen Psycho should watch it immediately. Even if you don't enjoy horror films, Psycho is still worth seeing simply because it is a flawless film.

28 April 2001,Hitchcock's landmark horror that led to a slew of slayers.,"This is the 1960 culprit that catapulted the horror film to an altogether new and gruesome plateau. It's the ship that launched a thousand blood-spurting imitators, although that was never Alfred Hitchcock's intent. Unfortunately, 90 per cent of those writers and directors inspired by his unprecedented work in ""Psycho"" never got past the initial primitive thrill of seeing on-screen violence for the first time. They didn't ""get"" the homework that went into this brilliantly macabre masterpiece. Just what DID make the infamous shower scene and ""Mother"" Bates' stairwell confrontation so shockingly memorable, other than providing front row forum seats to the carnage?

With ""Psycho,"" the master of suspense would tempt us to enter the intricate, insidious mind of a violent, psychotic killer, something he surely tampered around with in ""Strangers On a Train."" Hitch himself created the essential tool kit for modern day terror  implementing story, set-up, characterization, photography, camera technique, mood and music in order to weave an elaborate spider's web that would playfully entice, then seduce his intended victim, the audience.

Norman Bates will forever be enshrined as THE infamous poster boy of cinematic psychosis. As expounded by Simon Oakland's psychiatrist in the last reel, Norman was an isolated, terrified, severely undernourished man-child consumed by a hideously abnormal fear of change. In the end, the self-suffocating Norman lashed out like a wild, kicking, screaming child at a world he never knew or understood. Smart enough to distance himself and the Bates Motel as far from the highway of humanity as possible, it still wasn't far enough. For somewhere down the line, fate, coincidence, or maybe just a primal need for human contact, would inevitably lead a John Doe (or Marion Crane) to his door.

The most compelling scene for me is when the verrrrrry brave Lila Crane sneaks into the decrepit Bates' house behind the motel to investigate her suspicions as to sister Marion's disappearance. After coyly tormenting us throughout the first three-fourths of the movie, Hitch finally lets us in on the equally decrepit world of Norman Bates and his mother. Norman's bedroom holds the key elements to his enslaved childhood. The pathetic little bed with his careworn stuffed animal nearby, the little phonograph with Beethoven's ""Eroica"" record in place. It's such a private, eerily invasive moment that one feels guilty for possessing this natural Peeping Tom' curiosity.

Seeing Norman huddled up looking maniacally serene, immured within the confines of a ""new"" prison and armed only with a security blanket, you know that the poor innocent fly that lands on his hand, a fly he promises to respect, will never see the light of day again. And neither will Norman...despite the inferior sequels that tried to alter his obvious fate.

We can only thank Anthony Perkins for sacrificing a brilliant, promising, and highly versatile film career after bestowing upon us the most definitive, sympathetic creature of violence ever to assault the eyes. There will never be another one like him. Janet Leigh, one of Hollywood's biggest, fluffiest stars at this juncture, graciously cut short a dramatic ""starring"" role and instead offered us the screen's most tragic golden girl of all time. Both of their sacrifices were rewarded with film immortality.

I was introduced to ""Psycho"" at the age of 9. My older brother and I had the option one night of seeing ""Psycho"" or Jerry Lewis' ""Cinderfella"" at the local Riviera Theater. I wanted Jerry Lewis but my older brother had clout and, of course, won out. Needless to say I lost a good portion of my innocence (and my hair!) that night, succumbing to the frequent nightmares and shower traumas that obviously accompany such a youthful experience. Oh, yes, there is that abnormal fear I developed of screeching violin strings...

On a bright note, my faith in today's horror suspense was restored after experiencing the bravura Shyamalan-directed ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" a raw, but creepy and effective little thriller filmed on a pittance. Both took stock of Hitchcock's tool kit for terror. ""Blair Witch"" proves once again that the real horror of shock films today lie not in its low-grade budgets, but in its third-grade scripts and mentality.

Alfred Hitchcock opened our eyes in awe, wonderment and, yes, horror. But never in disgust. And he never sacrificed his story or characters for the sake of shock. We can only apologize for all the gratuitous ""Friday the Thirteenth"" and ""Halloween"" dreck that rose out of his ashes.",10
29 November 1998,They cannot make it better!,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, and made me afraid of the shower. And the music in this movie was incredibly intense. I don't think they can improve on this movie. We don't need to see more of the gory details to know what is happening.

25 September 2023,"""We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?""","FILM: 10/10.

I had the immense pleasure of rewatching Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, Psycho, for its 63rd anniversary, and it's pure perfection. As the world ventured into the 1960s, Hitchcock gifted us with what would be not only his finest work but also his last great film of his career.

Hitchcock, ever the boundary-pusher, delves into controversial themes with finesse in Psycho. Armed with a captivating story and a fantastic script, he takes us on a thrilling journey filled with murder and intrigue. The film's structure, with its two distinct halves and ever-changing main cast, keeps you engaged from start to finish.

The performances in this film are exceptional. Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh shine in their roles, bringing depth and nuance to their characters. Even the supporting cast, despite their limited screen time, delivers solid performances that add to the overall excellence of the film.

One of the most brilliant decisions Hitchcock made was to film Psycho in black and white. This choice enhances the eerie ambiance of the Bates Motel and its surroundings, turning them into characters of their own.

And who could forget Bernard Herrmann's iconic score? It's a masterpiece in itself, enhancing the tension and adding an extra layer of suspense to every scene.

Of course, Psycho is most famous for its groundbreaking shower scene and the shocking finale, which courted controversy in its time. Hitchcock's willingness to take risks pays off, making the film all the more unforgettable.

More than six decades later, Psycho remains a taut, fascinating watch. Its iconic scenes and characters have left an indelible mark on cinema history. Hitchcock's ability to keep us enthralled from the first frame to the last is a testament to his genius.

In my book, Psycho deserves a perfect score. It's a timeless classic that continues to thrill and captivate audiences, a shining example of Hitchcock at the height of his craft. Pure Hitchcock perfection, indeed.

18 June 1999,The best horror movie ever,"I have watched this film about four times now, and I can safely say that this is the best horror movie ever. The actors are the best thing about it. Anthony Perkins is superb as the shy, gorgeous, boyish Norman Bates. His twitchings and stammerings are scarily flawless, and the scene where the car stops momentarily sinking into the swamp, and he stares with a look of pure terror in his eyes, then ultimate relief when it continues are unforgettable. His ""...I wouldn't even harm a fly"" face at the end is inimitable. As for Janet Leigh, she couldn't have gotten into her part more. She looks genuinely desperate when confronted by the police officer. Hitchcock controls the audience as if he were pressing keys on a piano with this film. Everything is perfect about this film, and has become one of my personal favourites. If you haven't seen it, see it now.

17 October 2005,Still Amazing After All These Years,"Being an avid movie fan, I have seen too many motion pictures to even bother trying to count. I love all types: drama, comedy, action, sci-fi, foreign and horror. But I would have to say that my favorite genre is suspense. Something about thrilling audiences without the use of special effects, and creating realistic settings which cause a sense of dread for the audience. And nobody, in my opinion, accomplished this with a greater sense of style, polish, and dignity than Alfred Hitchcock. His films are full of great dialog, well-rounded characters, and genuine and original shocks.

Of all of his films, my favorite would have to be ""Psycho"". This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.

What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.

One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off. See it for the first time (and even a tenth) and enjoy a master director at the peak of his craft.",10

Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
18 July 2014,Master Moviemaker Makes Murder Masterpiece...,"When one considers the fact that PSYCHO is based on the depredations of Ed Gein (by way of Robert Bloch), it's almost impossible to imagine that even as great a Movie Maestro as Alfred Hitchcock could turn it all into such a stylish and suspenseful masterpiece. But he does. (Let's not forget to give credit where credit is due: Robert Bloch is the man whose imagination transformed the ghoul Gein into Norman Bates; Stephano fashioned his scenario from the novel.) For those who aren't familiar with Gein, he was a cannibal necrophiliac who wanted to be a woman- his mother in the book and in the movie, but female, period, in real life. He would actually dress up in a ""suit"" made of a woman's skin and dance around his deserted farmhouse at night. (I've always loved the song DANCIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT by King Harvest, but whenever I think of Ed Gein these days- which ain't often-, I think of that song...) THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE was also based on Gein's atrocities and comes closer, I think, to the real horror of what he did, but Bloch and Hitchcock first separately and then combined turned it into one of the Truly Great Murder Movies- one for the ages.",10
1 June 2015,"55 Years Later And ""Psycho's"" Horror Continues","Below are 2 quotes from actor Anthony Perkins who had played the pivotal role of Norman Bates in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". I think these quotes are sure to be of some interest to anyone who is at all familiar with this film and its legacy to the genre of horror.

(1) ""Hitchcock thought of Psycho (1960) as a comedy. When it first came out, it was greeted with screams of laughter. People laughed all the way through, so much so that he declared it was the first time he had ever been out-thought by an audience. He knew it was going to be funny, but he didn't realize it was going to be that funny.""

(2) ""Not many people know this, but I was in New York rehearsing for a play when the shower scene was filmed in Hollywood. It is rather strange to go through life being identified with this sequence knowing that it was my double. Actually, the first time I saw Psycho and that shower scene was at the studio.""

.... Well, there you have it.",7
20 December 2002,SHE WOULDN'T HARM A FLY...,"Clearly, the best horror film ever made. I have never seen a movie with so many tricks and surprises pulled off in a successful manner. I was so involved with Janet Leigh's character when I first watched this film. Yet I knew she was doing something wrong. Suddenly when her final destination is at hand, I was purely surprised. Then suddenly, I'm pulled into the world of a hermit-like motel owner who cares for his invalid mother. I see no mistakes or bad moves in this film, and the performances are excellent. 10/10

19 February 1999,You Can't Just Watch It Once !,"Psycho is the kind of movie that entices you to watch it over and over. It demands you study the camera angles, facial expressions, background of the scenes, clothes, paintings on the walls, etc. Simply put: the movie is a masterpiece. I get so wrapped up into the movie that I forget that it's forty years later and the actors/actresses in this flick are now all old, or dead. Anthony Perkins, the man who plays the mysterious Norman Bates who struggles with the love of his mother, died in the 1990s. Anthony Perkins shows the talent of an actor that is second to none. His performance is brilliant.

Vera Miles reminds me of the nosey best-friend that each one of us has. She's not a totally lovable person but her character shows that deep down, she is a caring person. She has more guts than me when she goes to the house to visit Norman's mother.

John Gavin's role would be the role that most of the men watching the movie could relate to the most. He appears as a clean-cut man who just so happens is having an affair. He plays the character of Sam. John Gavin, the actor, is complicated, however. You will understand when you watch the movie. He really doesn't speak a lot but his body language is excellent. I would love to know more about Mr. John Gavin but there's very little information about him on the internet.

Patricia Hitchcock is the director's daughter. She plays the role of an office worker. Her acting is totally believable and I found myself watching the scene in which she appears over and over.

Alfred Hitchcock's famous movie Psycho is my favorite-all-time movie and every time I watch it, I see something else in a scene that I did not see before.

Lastly, Janet Leigh plays the woman who checks into Bates' Motel and it's a visit which the viewer will never forget.

I love this movie so much that I wish it were possible for me to shake the hand of every actor and actress who starred in this classic tale. Once you see the movie I think you will agree.

The camera men deserves a special pat on the back for their fine work.",10
5 July 2013,A Film That Shaped Modern Thrillers,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
13 November 2022,Substance is Quality,"And less is more. Films like this are true gems. It's a cliché but it's true: They don't make them like this anymore. Today's horror movies lack even a hint of subtlety. Subtlety, when properly delivered, can increase a horror film's credibility, it's suspense most of all. Today's horror movies are devoid of subtle suspense, frankly they make me laugh, and that's not horror. They jump the shark invariably. Nothing is left to the imagination. This film is different.

The first time I watched this movie was at the Pittsburgh Playhouse in 1980. I was 11 years old and ready for some horror. The playhouse itself was an older affair (dated to the 1800's) and rumored itself to be haunted. The viewing was old style reel to reel. The die was cast. What a magnificent setting for a young boy to see this particular classic horror film. I swear I can still recall the seating and the popcorn in that old theatre, and being intrigued by this film.

Enough about that, back to the film.

Anthony Perkins (Norman) acting in this movie are astonishingly top shelf. The script and Perkins' delivery portray a creepy shut-in schizophrenic to a tee. His acting is superb and compelling. The character of Norman Bates was realistically creepy, a real strange fellow.

The role of Detective Arbogast is very well portrayed.

I'm deliberately going to leave a lot out of my review here because I don't want to spoil it for others.

If you appreciate the old black and whites, this movie is highly recommended.",10
8 June 2021,Holds up,"An essential film. For a movie whose greatness hinges on its pulsating perfect score, even Hitchcock thought so, it's still a full accomplishment with considerably great performances (specifically Perkins and Leigh), groundbreaking themes and images, iconic editing, and a compelling story. In addition, being a true gateway film for Hollywood to again reinvent itself and allow more risqué films from major studios and major directors. No one worked within but also pushed the bounds of censorship laws and regulations, that plagued many huge productions of the time, like Hitchcock did. Defining violence of the 60's before it would inevitably reinvent itself in movies such as Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween, Psycho truly defined what the story outline of a modern slasher could choose to go with, and most likely make a serviceable picture. Even my mother, who hates horror movies, was bummed she couldn't see it and says she would still like to sometime... that's the power of Hitchcock, effectively making movies serviceable to everyone, but dense enough that those who want a challenge will get one (for his more complex movies), and that's the true definition of a master. Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors and normally I wouldn't speak so highly and definitively about something, I figured it was worth it for a man who made back to back to back critical outlines for their respective genres.

If even possible anymore, go into this not knowing the plot.",9
3 May 2018,Would utterly fail in lesser hands,"One of Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known films. Regarded as one of the very first examples of the slasher genre. Still one of the most beloved thrillers ever made and an all-around classic. The shower scene movie.

And yet, if that's all you know the movie from, you're missing a lot. The shower scene was scandalous back in its day, much like the rest of the film in general, but it doesn't encapsulate the film all that well. It happens near the middle of the film and a lot happens after it. Sure, it is the most striking scene in the film, but I would personally put more weight on the overall performances of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh as Marion Crane.

With these two powerful actors Hitchcock manages to tell a truly haunting and nerve-wracking story. Because, to be honest, nowadays the movie would be a bit boring and a lot predictable. The viewer is never truly confused as to where the film is going. But in a way that even enhances the experience. Because you can so clearly see why these characters would make these decisions given the amount of information they have.

Add in some masterful camerawork, some really insightful use of surroundings and shadows, the two main actors and a one of the creepiest scores ever produced, and you have a masterful film in your hands.

A must see film for all fans of horror and still a really, really good experience all around, despite its age.",7

1 October 2018,First movie of the modern era,"Young audiences today no doubt find it hard to believe that a horror classic such as this could have been made without a thought toward youngsters going to see it. But PSYCHO was made when nearly all top quality directors were making movies routinely for adults. It would be another 8 or 10 years before studios would discover the youth market as perhaps an answer to their financial woes. Flash forward to the present when adults have to hunt for the elusive independent, unpublicized gems that are available today for them. Hence this thriller makes the audience wait 45 minutes for the first scare. That script would never get shot today. But when that scare came, it was a pip- killing the star off half way through! Something new had happened here, and Hitch became the first to insist no one be admitted to the theater after the movie had begun. At that time it was common for patrons to walk into movies at any time and stay to see the start of the next show up to the time they had come in. Hitch changed the way audiences went to the movies. It suddenly became okay for major stars and directors to develop nasty or violent projects that would always be a thorn in the side to conservative producers. Eight years after PSYCHO, Bonnie and Clyde would break new ground too with its technicolor bloodshed in that film. After all these years, it's still painful to decide which of his films is his best. Is it the cold brilliance of this, or the hauntingly beautiful tragedy of Vertigo - or the terrifying, inexplicable The Birds?",10
29 August 2001,The Best horror film of all time!!!,"Psycho is the best horror and slasher film ever made! It stars Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam. plot: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is running away from her town, and everyone she know after stealing 40,000 dollars. She stops to spend the night at a motel- The Bates Motel. She meets the owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), he is a kind man and he suggests that she eats dinner with him, when Norman runs up to his creepy old mansion, Marion hears Norman's mother start to argue with him about him eating with a woman. Norman tells Marion that his mother has became ill. Later that night, when Marion is taking a shower, Norman's mother gets a butcher knife and stabs Marion to death. About a week later Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) is looking for her, and so is Marion's boyfriend Sam (John Gavin, and a Detective (Martin Balsam). The Detective searches every motel for Marion, then finally finds the bates motel, after talking to Norman and finding out everything he can, he goes up to the mansion to talk to the mother, but then he is to murdered. Lila and Sam get worried and talk to the sherriff of the town, he tells them that Norman's mother has been dead for 10 years. Sam and Lila go to the motel to try and find out whats going on, will they to be murdered? Its a great movie and every horror/slasher/thriller fan will enjoy it.",
17 December 2019,Psycho is the perfect thriller,"Aaahhh. Psycho is about as close as you can come to a perfect thriller. Thrillers are all about how the story is told. You show too much, there's not enough suspense. Show to little, and people don't know what's going on. Different angles and lighting can evoke different feelings. Hitchcock is a master of not only coming up with a great story, but telling that story perfectly. Hitchcock finds the perfect balance between terror, suspense, and mystery in all his films, and Psycho is certainly no exception. It is no surprise that one of the most iconic scenes in Hollywood history is in this movie. To top it off the acting is phenomenal as well. Often times with films at the time scenes of strong emotion would be excessively dramatic and over the top. However, in psycho, these scenes are not as often, and when they, the over the top dramatization seems appropriate, considering their lives are usually at stake. If you want to watch a fantastic movie, watch Psycho. If you want to fall asleep tonight, don't watch Psycho

28 May 2020,"A Stylish, Efficient Thriller; One of Hitchcock's Very Best","Bad luck for a bored bombshell, who opportunistically pockets a large sum of money, skips town and unwittingly pauses at a mass-murderer's motel to lay low. To say more would be a disservice to the uninitiated, even if the major points have already been spoiled by way of cultural osmosis. Sixty years is a long time to keep a secret, especially when all the most important scenes have been so frequently mirrored.

Compelled to operate on an extremely low budget (studio brass had major doubts about the premise), in Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock leans heavily on his finely-honed directorial senses - artistry and atmosphere, primarily - in lieu of a dazzling set or gaudy wardrobe. The end result is a very moody, up-close and personal piece, entirely appropriate for such a character-driven tragedy. Subtext is the rule of the day, whether it's foreshadowing the awful events to come or nervously reveling in their aftermath.

Much is said outside of the dialogue, in other words, and in such visually compelling ways! The guiding hand of frequent collaborator (and graphic design legend) Saul Bass is apparent in more than just the dynamic opening credits. Bass may not have actively directed the famous shower episode, as is often rumored, but his tight storyboards and Bernard Herrmann's indispensable musical cues essentially make the scene. Not to downplay Hitchcock's involvement, either; it takes a special brand of mastermind to assemble and curate such talent, to piece it all together in just the right order to achieve maximum dramatic effect.",9
31 May 2019,Hitchcock's masterpiece?,"It's hard to say if this is his masterpiece, and because this movie is fantastic in nearly every way, this should tell you a lot about Hitchcock as a director However this movie is definitely a masterpiece, and completely revolutionised cinema (by showing a flushing toilet funnily enough). I'm trying to avoid the elephant in the room, or the shower scene, because it has been talked about to death. Yes it's a great scene, but Psycho is a lot more than just that The acting is phenomenal, most notably Anthony Perkins who I would believe is actually insane because of his performance. The film is also a technical masterpiece, as is expected from Hitchcock. To cram everything in would ruin you're experience. Even if you know the twist ending, it will still be shock and that is a testament to this films writing

17 October 2021,a supreme classic,"""Psycho"" is the kind of movie that you really have to make sure that you see if you're going to be the kind of people who want to talk about the history of Hollywood movies. Like some others, Mr. Hitchcock produced or directed quite a few famous films. The basic idea in this one is to tell the story of the strange things that happen after a woman checks in at a spooky old motel. In a way, many might claim that this movie by itself could show you that Mr. Hitchcock belongs having a reputation for doing the very highest quality work, but I'd especially recommend ""The Birds"" if you just can't resist a little more scary stuff. And try to get back to the car safely when you're all done!

4 August 2001,The best horror movie of all time,"Nowadays we have been exposed to scarier horror and macabre to find Hitchcock's classic frightening. However, there are certain elements which make this film the best horror movie of all time.

Considering the era (1960) Hitchcock used innovative camera angles to build up the tension and fear in Psycho. For example at the beginning the camera pans down on the motel giving the impression that the house is watching the motel. This personification (that the house is alive) is used again when Marion's sister (Lila) approaches the house near the end. The camera changes from objective to subjective numerous times to give the impression that the house is watching Lila. More camera actions which are innovative is when Bates and Crane are talking over supper. The low camera angle gives the impression that Norman Bates is bigger and therefore more menacing. This is an early indication of the horror which is to come. These are just examples of the clever use of camera.

The music and lightening is a major strength of the film. For example when there is the scene with the corpse the mummified mother is a mixture of dark and light. This represents the good and evil side of Norman. Moreover, there is light shining at the backs of the eye sockets which makes the corpse appear alive. Hitchcock innovated with the signature tune (""screeching violins"") and that builds up the suspense. Such directors as Speilberg have copied this idea (e.g. Jaws)

Symbolism is a good part of this film. For example Bates has an unusual hobby of stuffing birds. By analyzing Anthony Perkins performance he perches on the edge of his chair as if he is a bird seeking his prey (i.e. Crane). He also acts like a bird when he twitches his head from time to time. Another clever use of symbolism is when Lila picks up the book in the Psycho house. She is unsure which side is what as they are equally patterned. This represents Norman's character; you can't determine his side as he has two personalities. More symbolism is Marion's change in underwear when she packs her case; white represents purity and black represents evil/wrong doing. Symbolism like this is also used when the camera shows the stuffed bird towering over Bates when he becomes uneasy with Marion's conversation. This represents his mother watching over him and changing his personality. By watching the film other examples of symbolism can be depicted throughout.

What made Psycho so remarkable at the time was realism. The setting was a realistic place and familiar to American and worldwide audiences (i.e the motel, the city - Phoenix, Arizona) rather than fictional places like Transylvania. Also, Norman had a medical condition (he was a psychopath). This was a breakaway from the previous unrealistic films, such as Dracula. This made the film even more frightening and people were scared that such events could occur with ""real"" people. Also what was realistic about this film was that the characters were neither ""goodies"" or ""baddies"" - they had transformations. Marion was a mixture of good and bad (the color of her underwear she chooses represents this and the color of the car she buys.) This makes the film more realistic as it shows that people all have good and bad in them, which is true.

Moreover what stood out in the film was what happened to Janet Leigh. She was killed of very early into the film and this shocked audiences that the A-list Hollywood actress was so brutally murdered. This is nearly on a par with what Drew Barrymore chose to do for Scream when she chose to be Casey. This fact shows Hitchcock has influenced the thinking for other horror movies.

Therefore, although you will be better of with Scream or Scary Movie to scare you this film is an example of cinematography at its best.",
17 June 2021,"You got to be kidding me, this should be a UNANIMOUS solid 10 from EVERYONE!!","There are movies then there are masterpieces that create a genre within a genre!! This film really started it all and has the most iconic scene in movie history that alone merits a 10 from everyone. I sometimes have given out 10s in the spur of the moment after watching a great film but psycho is the best horror film ever made because it was 1st and it defined the genre!! Hitchcock in my opinion is the best director EVER his films are timeless and have been copied but NEVER duplicated!! Also psycho 2 is a solid 9!!

18 October 2014,B/W is Best,"Do we actually need color pictures? How come that this in that perspective so outdated movie still does its job so much better than colored counterparts?

In fact, I ask myself why other film makers still insist on color instead of B/W knowing the impact of Psycho and Film Noir. There are some clever adaptations, though viz the bleak colors, such as in Seven, Sixth Sense and The Ring. Psychological horror tends to fade to gray.

Well, despite all this, Hitchcock's the Suspense Master and Psycho is his best film. I'd like to compare to Agatha Christie's best story, the 6th most sold novel of all times, Ten Little N*****s aka And Then There Were None: there is something crude about both productions. TLN is not very elaborated in its language, rather straightforward. Yet, the background information about each victim is direct and convincing. The main plot is fantastic and the atmosphere the novel brings at least got me entangled in it.

Now, Psycho on the other hand, has a less fantastic story: it could happen that a girl at large ends in a gloomy motel at the will of a mentally ill murderer. The similarity rather lies in the movie's lack of pretension, in stark contrast to say, Vertigo.

Besides this comparison, it's noteworthy that Psycho",10
5 July 1999,Psycho,"Classic horror story based on the novel by Robert Bloch that is smartly directed by the master of mystery and suspense Hitchcock, who goes right for the juggler and never lets go. The shower scene...Excuse me!...The legendary shower scene still startles and horrifies. Brilliant cinematography by John L. Russell and first class performances from Perkins and Leigh.

30 April 2019,"Saintly is an ambiguous word- ""Psycho"": Why You Should Watch:","""Psycho""- A review of Hitchcock's slick, insight into an alternative psyche. ""Psycho"" is Hitchcock at his finest, the film was realised in 1960 and was met with staggering adversity. However, as the years passed people recognized it as a masterpiece. The plot centres around a women named Marion (Janet Leigh), who embezzles a large sum of cash, in order to run off with her ""star-crossed lover"". However, midway through her excursion she decides to check into a vacancy for the night at the elusive ""Bates' Motel"", run by the reclusive Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). One of this films aspects that deserves an abundance of acclaim is its spine-chilling and accurate portrayal of a psychopath. Hitchcock masterfully manipulates the mind of the audience into perceiving things which are not actually shown on screen. Primarily in the notorious ""shower scene"". Hitch's direction is magnificent and seamless, the characters are well established, the film is littered with cleverly thought out and well placed symbolism and to conclude it all a jaw-dropping/disturbing twist, which will haunt you for the rest of the evening. In conclusion, those looking for a mindless ""slasher"", then ""Psycho"" is not the film for you! ""Psycho"" may be classified as a ""horror"" but in my mind it will always be a ""psychological thriller"". Simply as must see for any film fanatic- It is also my favourite film. It is unsurprisingly a 10/10. Screenplay: 10. Direction: 10. Acting: 10. Cinematography: 10. Characterization: 10. ""It's not like my mother is a maniac or a raving thing. She just goes a little mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?""- Norman Bates.",10
20 April 2019,One of the best horror films ever,"Easily Alfred's finest and most legendary work. From Anthony Perkins amazing performance to the classic horror soundtrack, Hitch didn't overlook a single aspect of this film. An extremely unique and horrifying take on obsession and multi personalities. Manipulated and terrified audiences for years. Must see horror!

Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
31 March 2008,A master-class in screen suspense.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power.

14 December 2018,Mean Strings,"How do you write about, let alone review something that's been picked apart and assembled again, stretched into 24 hour performances by lesser artists, copied, imitated, quoted, spoofed, franchised, and even remade shot for shot? About something that has been appreciated, raved about and even worshipped for nearly 60 long years by audiences, devotees and eventually even critics?

There are reasons for all that. John Gavin may have been wooden but Vera Miles was good enough, Janet Leigh and Robert Balsam were exceptionally good and Perkins was sensational. It was Robert Bloch's best achievement in lurid pulp, Stefano's best screenwriting moment and Hitch was quite literally at the height of his powers. So were his wife Alma and assistant Peggy, who also sensed how times were changing and how the audiences were ready for something never before attempted or seen - a film with moments so pounding and visceral that it would end up changing the entire ballgame.

And then there's the score, equally deeply ingrained on our culture. ""Hitchcock does about two thirds of his films - I finish them for him"" - Herrmann would say, and it's been true from Harry through to Marnie. This one contains the most famous musical cue of all times and a neurotic, hurtling main title to boot, but it is the slow bits, during which Hitch handles the passage of time, trouble, unease, mystery, suspense and degradation that are just superb, allowing for some of the most exciting moments ever commited to film. Elegant and decidedly modern, all the more lethal for its reduction to a chamber string orchestra, the score is well produced too; loads of sticky reverb and compression were slapped on those ferocious shrieks, making them always sound a bit limp on later recordings - and certainly lacking that thoroughly ripping effect. Luckily, Hitch gave in and went along with his composer.

To wrap it up - the less said about Psycho, the better - and it is best enjoyed in silence and darkness. It has a flaw or two but its unique, darkly unsettling magic speaks for itself even today and it still feels like an exceptionally modern, cool, groundbreaking film. Whatever Walt Disney may have thought of it.",10
4 April 2018,Groundbreaking,"Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is a crime thriller which follows a woman who unexpectedly steals money from her boss with the intentions of running away with her boyfriend, so they can start a new life together. Although her plan takes drastic turns as she is faced with many unforeseen complications and danger. This film is a clear example as to why Hitchcock is praised as being the master of suspense. Psycho keeps you captivated for the entire runtime. The script manipulates the audience with sharp obscure dialogue. The incredible screenplay is accompanied by oscar worthy performances, particularly by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. His character of Norman Bates is easily one of the most compelling aspects of the film. His peculiar nature makes him such a complex and well established character. The music, cinematography and editing work together beautifully, creating such an uneasy and eerie tone. For its time, Psycho was groundbreaking. It subverted the formulaic structures of the crime genre, as well as pushed boundaries surrounding what was tolerated during its social context. Psycho is still insanely nail biting and truly horrifying. It holds up incredibly well, in terms of entertainment value. But beneath all that it is one of the most well made movies of all time. Psycho is outstanding and that is why I give it a 10.",10
1 May 2002,Classic Hitchcock,"Pros: Janet leigh, Cinematography, Directing, Score.

Cons: Janet leigh is in only half the movie.

Psycho isn't Hitchcock's best movie (the honor belongs to rear window) but probably the master of suspense most suspenseful and ultimately scary. Janet leigh plays a secretary who steals for the sake of her boyfriend and is on the run from the law. She happens upon the bates motel and is promptly murdered before the night is done. Bernard herrmann provides a masterful score matched by hitchcock's camera work. Hitchcock's movies tends to have a twist and psycho is probably the best out of all his movies. Only vertigo comes close. Anthony Perkins should have won an oscar for his portrayal of Norman Bates as he is the real star of the film. It gets a bit corny at the end.

Premise: The death of a young woman leads to an investigation into the bates motel.

Psycho was nominated for four Academy awards and is a winner of the AFI top 100 movies.

Grade: 9.7/10 (One of the best thrillers of all time)",9

24 June 2001,Hitchcock's best film !,"It's sad but true, Hitchcock is known today by many for one movie and that movie is Psycho. With over 80 films to his list of films, only one stands out as his. Many people don't know this but Hitchcock's Psycho reflects a lot of his own life in 1960. His wife had recently had a stroke during the production of Psycho. A lot of his fears of death and horror came out in the filming. Plus, for 1960 a black and white film was considered wrong? Why film in black and white when you can do it in color. Still, the Best Picture that year was THE APARTMENT and guess what that was filmed in?

13 November 2014,My favourite film of all time!,"By far the greatest work of The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. When I watched this film for the first time aged 16, I was sucked in by the plot, the characters, Bernard Herrmann's score and the terrific acting. I went in knowing one thing about the movie, and that was that there is a shower scene. It was the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen and it was the first mystery/thriller I'd ever seen. Now I am a big fan of both Hitch and the genre.

The best aspect of this movie is the fantastic acting. What can you say that hasn't already been said about the performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates except that it's a tragedy he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His delivering of the script, his shyness and sudden twists is one of the best acting performances I've witnessed. But that doesn't take away from the rest of the cast. Janet Leigh is wonderful as Marion Crane, and supporting talent from John Gavin, Martin Balsam and especially Vera Miles, make for a film you can watch over and over.

This is the first film I ever saw where afterwards, I wanted to know everything there was to know about it. I watched all the making of documentaries I could find, I wanted to watch all the sequels (Psycho II is also very good by the way) and I even chose the film as my specialist subject in a quiz we did in my college.

I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing right until the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen. You're engrossed by these characters and the plot that you don't want to miss a second.

Suspenseful, sophisticated, chilling, thrilling and an absolute masterpiece of film making.",10

26 November 1998,The Greatest Movie of All Time!,"I viewed this movie at the age of 9 years old. It has been my favorite movie ever since. Almost 20 years. The two movies that affected me most as a child were: ""The Amityville Horror"" (I've had more dreams about that house than any other thing..ever!) and ""Psycho"". After watching ""Psycho"", I never viewed ANYTHING as being 100% safe. No castles, no zombies, no monsters. Normal people in risky situations exposed before all. Everyone has skeletons in their closets. Even those who seem to be as harmless as a fly. (Such as Norman Bates). This movie not only changed the course of movie history, by killing off the apparent heroine 1/3 of the way through the film (making history) but, proved that their was absolutely NOWHERE to be totally safe. It revealed inner demons of the two main characters which reflect on the entire world and maybe the truest description of how the world really is. Deep down we all have these bad thoughts, but unlike Norman Bates, most of us can bottle them up inside and carry them to the grave.After all, ""we all go a little mad...sometimes"".

27 December 2010,"""Our private traps""","The horror genre has often thrived on tales of the unknown, the inexplicable and the supernatural, and this can be very effective in its own way. However there has long been another tradition of scaring people with more worldly horrors, with the genuinely unnerving touch of wholly possible events, familiar settings and the thought that this could happen to you too. And who else would be behind one of the most seminal and iconic entries in this subgenre but Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock, the director who specialised in bringing real-world terrors home to his audience.

Perhaps the main secret to Psycho's success is the unusual structuring of its screenplay. The adaptation by Joseph Stefano contains more or less all the actual events of the original Robert Bloch novel, except that the emphasis has changed. The novel was told largely from Norman Bates's perspective, with Marion Crane turning up on his doorstep a few chapters in. However the adaptation brings us in to the story with Marion, telling the first half of the narrative through her eyes. This not only provides one of the biggest red herrings in the history of the thriller, it is a really effective way of keying us into the story on the level of an ordinary ""everywoman"", albeit one who has stolen a large sum of money, but even this the script goes to lengths to rationalise, embroiling us in her growing paranoia.

But the screenplay would be worth little if it wasn't for the fact Hitchcock knows exactly how to present this material. He uses a lot of long takes in the scenes with Janet Leigh, using his roving camera to keep us with her, or at least with her thoughts, as for example when the camera pans down to the pile of money on the bed then over to the suitcase. Such manoeuvres can be very gimmicky and intrusive, so a director can only really get away with them if the picture is otherwise utterly compelling, which of course Psycho is. Hitch contrasts the long takes with a choppy editing pattern when Anthony Perkins is around, as suited to the awkward oddity of his presence. One of the director's finest constructions is the scene where Leigh and Perkins talk together in the parlour, surrounded by all those stuffed birds, a rather long scene, heavy on dialogue, and thus one that could easily become boring. However Hitch creates several modulations in tone simply by varying his angle. For example, when Bates is angered by Marion's suggestion that his mother be put someplace, Perkins is shown in profile, with that predatory owl prominent at the top of the screen, while the contrasting shots of Leigh become close-ups, looking vulnerable with her back to the wall.

And one of the biggest keys to the realism (and therefore the ability to disturb) of Psycho is the quality of the acting performances. Janet Leigh plays a very credible game of trying to balance outward calmness and inner turmoil, which is really crucial to make the picture work. If the average audience member is to empathise with her character, we have to believe that she is not some hardened criminal, and that she is racked with guilt and fear of getting caught. Martin Balsam is great too as the easygoing private investigator, making his character likable by the naturalism of his performance. Finest of all however is of course Anthony Perkins, the genius of whose performance is the simplicity and fragility with which he plays Norman Bates, and that edge of menace he suddenly brings out of nowhere. His turn here is ideally suited to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense, as it treads that line of allowing the audience to be taken in by one red herring, but is also believable in retrospect once the truth is finally revealed.

I'll finish with a quick word on the musical score for Psycho. While Bernard Hermann's ""stabbing strings"" have been cited and praised as much as virtually every other aspect of the picture, I'm also struck by the similarity between the main theme (the sharp, tense piece that plays over the opening credits and several other scenes) and the penultimate movement of the Russian composer Modeste Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. This latter piece refers to a macabre Slavic folk tale about a witch who kidnaps and murders children. Whether or not the link is deliberate, both pieces of music strike the same tone to suit their grisly and terrifying subject matter.",9
8 August 2005,Phenomenal directing and a chilling Perkins make this a true classic.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
26 January 1999,THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE,"Anything i would say has already been said but still it's worth crediting this masterpiece again. What else would you want with a movie great direction, superb acting,great set,great story With one of the best acting performances of our time Anthony Perkins created something that other actors have never been able to accomplish that is successfully he made someone you'd never suspect. Sure you might have thought him to be the one when you first saw it but he crafted a man whose emotions you would think would definitely help his mother but wouldn't join with her Hitchcock who is also the best director of all time sends a never again greatly crafted 100 K Diamond to the screen with a magnificiant SHING!!! of the blade

15 July 2001,One of the greatest thrillers of all time,"Psycho is truly one of the greatest thrillers of all times. Directed by the master of suspense himself. If Hitchcock didn't direct this movie then it would probably not be great. Come on look at the remake. That was some crap right there. Anthoney Perkins does an amazing performance as Norman Bates. But in the remake you got crumby actor Vince Vaughn. So next time if you want to rent a true thriller, rent a classic like Psycho, or Rear Window. (another great hitchcock flick)

3 February 2008,Director's Cuts,"When this was shown on UK TV as a classic for the first time in the mid '70's I considered myself a horror film fan and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Since then of course the Hollywood horror film has ""progressed"" to the stage where only perversion and gore are considered fit entertainment meaning most people today would sadly now probably equate Psycho to their ideas of Mickey Mouse. However it remains to me the best of its kind, and as violent and sleazy as I'd want anything to get. Will tomorrow's film buffs think the Saw movies of today laughably non-violent too?

Woman steals money from employer and scrams but unfortunately runs into homicidal maniac who polishes her off as she's getting second thoughts  about coming clean! Leigh's shower scene is justly famous – I guess Hitch the voyeur would have been tickled by the microscopic attention it still gets. There was even a stultifying gigantic slow motion frame by frame movie exhibition in London in 2006 by some idle Arthead extending the 40 seconds into 6 or 7 hours. Really worthwhile to have a stab at! When I was a kid Arbogast getting it at the top of the stairs startled me the most, although if you see it again you wonder how he could defy gravity while dying. That moment with Perkins biting his fingernails as the car stops sinking into the mud! It has a fantastic plot (in the best sense), with Hitch pulling out all of the cinematic stops he could think of, that keeps you hooked to the pervy climax and thoughtful ending. As with a few other films, such as Once Upon A Time In America, the music score is integral and vital as Hitch recognised – without Herrmann's zigzag music you might as well have been watching a (better) Corman.

If something is labelled ""classic"" it doesn't have to be good or feelgood as well, but Psycho certainly was the first two.",8
18 June 2000,"I didn't see all of it, but of what i did.","I didn't see all of Psycho, but what I did see of it I liked. The way Hitchcock killed of the ""main"" character in the first half hour was utterly amazing. The suspense was some of the best I've ever seen, and he did it without nudity. Now thats a sign of a great film-maker.

10 November 2018,A classic in every sense of the word,"After picking the perfect moment and taking her boss' money, a woman on the run stays at a remote motel to let the heat die down, but when she disappears and the private detective hired to find her does as well the woman's sister and boyfriend decide to check out the Bates Motel for themselves.

This is one of the best horror films ever made. The biggest impact featured here is the film's technical prowess since the Black & White cinematography is so gorgeous and so sparse in that we see so little that the suspense is just dripping off the screen. One of the best examples of this is the death of the investigating officer where he's just calmly walking up the stairs when we see a door open ever so slightly on the balcony unseen, and then the killer walks out and stabs him which causes him to fall down the stairs. The way that he falls is so creepy because he falls in such a supernatural way that it just sticks out in contrast to the rest of the material around it. It reaches the level of technical highlight just as much as the infamous shower scene that includes probably the most famous death scene in film history without violence or obvious nudity. The rest of the technical qualities here are just as impressive which really shows the genius was known for the time it was made where it is a sign of good filmmaking of giving the viewer just enough to give them a little jolt whenever it comes into question with the rest of the scene. Many people know of the relationship between Norman and his mother, and the very first time we know of her when he's talking about her in the parlor room is a perfect example of that which is one of the creepiest scenes by the way he's saying things and how he's saying them that something's off and yet he keeps an air of respectability that lends itself perfectly to his character and the relationship between them which is rather creepy. Even the motel where they're staying is like that. The dark interiors, the weird stuffed animals along the walls, and the secrecy that surrounds it is remarkable that most of the time we are wondering the secrets behind it. That allows the film to really get a lot of suspense out of so many scenes that it has the effect of being able to draw in a viewer and really highlights the fantastic work in the later half as the ruse is unveiled with the sequence down in the cellar. Armed with one of the finest and first twist endings in the genre, there's a lot to really love with this one that holds it up over the one main minor flaw. The biggest letdown from this one is the fact that the film does stumble a bit in the middle half where it slows down to a rather bland and sluggish pace as it focuses on her sister trying to find someone to go with her to look into the disappearance. These scenes don't really maintain the kind of impressive atmosphere or pacing that the rest of the film completely excels at. This one does slip down to a rather minor degree as the various starting points to the later half and it's not that enjoyable to sit through. As well as some obvious issues that are raised specifically about the time-period that don't apply to modern-day issues, there's not much wrong with this one at all.

Today's Rating/PG-13: Implied Violence and off-screen Brief Nudity.",10
17 November 2012,The master of suspense is in full force here,"Welcome to the Bates Motel. 12 cabins, 12 vacancies. What are you doing here? Running from the police? Alright, well enjoy your stay and see you in the morning. Or maybe not. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most influential and fiendishly wonderful movie makers of the twentieth century. Before ""Psycho"", I had seen exactly 22 of Hitchcock's pictures. Most of them I enjoyed but none of them were as memorable as this piece of work. It is not just a cinematic accomplishment but also of successfully portraying someone who is indeed psycho. This movie was a shock when released in 1960 because of the way the movie was laid out. For example, it was unthinkable for a main character to be killed so early in the film. The goal was to put the audience on edge to the point where they had no idea what would happen next. And Hitchcock indeed pulled it off. In fact, he was sure to make clear that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie had begun. You must watch it from beginning to end. I am not going to tell you the plot because the less you know, the better. They don't call Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing.",10
2 August 2021,"We all go a little mad sometimes,,,","A girl embezzles 40,000 dollars and runs out of town. She stumbles onto a small hotel, run by an awkward young man named Norman, who lives in the house behind the hotel with his ill mother. As the young girl speaks with Norman, he seems very odd, but harmless. His mother, however, can be heard berating him in the house all the way down at the hotel. The girl wonders why he let's his mother speak to him like that. What kind of grown man lives with his mother?

What else can I say about Psycho that hasn't been said before. Horror classic.

8 October 2019,Still a Masterpiece,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" isn't just one of his best thrillers, or simply one of the best horror films, it's also one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a film with an amazing, haunting power that probes the darkest depths of the human psyche at an exhilarating speed. Fifty-nine years later ""Psycho"" still grips you with the same energy that made it a hit in 1960.

The story is so well known at this point that I don't think I need to summarize it here. What I will say to those who haven't yet seen ""Psycho"" is forget everything you think you know about Hitchcock, horror films, or classic movies. ""Pyscho"" defies all expectations with its beautiful black and white cinematography, Bernard Herrmann's now infamous score, and of course Anthony Perkins' iconic performance as Norman Bates - one of the greatest villains of all time. These elements, along with the efforts of the rest of the cast and the excellent screenplay, combine to make a thrilling cinematic experience like no other. 10/10.",10
29 March 2020,"I'm usually not a huge fan of classic horror films such as this, but this one is obviously pretty good.","It's interesting to see this movie classic who, by many opinions, have helped form the horror genre. It was better than some of today's movies, because it doesn't have all those modern horror cliches, like ""the evil"" and girls with long dark hair in white dresses.

26 December 2022,Endlessly fascinating classic,"Psycho is yet another Hitchcock masterpiece. This one is one his few true horror films, but it continues his trademark use of suspense and dread. Janet Leigh (unforgettable here) is the heroine (or maybe not). Anthony Perkins is unnervingly creepy as the Ultimate Mama's Boy. Bermard Herrmann's truly classic score was not even nominated for an Oscar, which basically makes Oscars useless. This is one of HItchcock's most adroitly cast movies; he even makes good use of the vapid hunkiness of John Gavin, and Vera Miles is terrific as Leigh's sister. Also wonderful are Lurene Tuttle, John McGavin and Pat Hitchcock (""she's always a bit late on Mondays""). And Virginia Gregg as Mrs. Bates' voice. Mercedes McCambride who? This movie is built for repeat viewings; if you are one of the few who hasn't seen it, do NOT let anyone tell you the plot. Then watch it. It's a great picture.

28 April 2006,Saw it in 1960,"I saw this movie in a packed house in 1960 without any knowledge of the plot--and judging by the reaction of the audience when the shower scene occurred, no one else had knowledge either.

When the scene began developing, there were gasps. When the curtain few open there were screams, and they continued during the stabbing. A state of fright literally hung over the theater. When Ms. Leigh slid down slowly, dying, people were still gasping and crying out. They were there! They had witnessed a real murder! Nothing in any previous movie had prepared the audience for this kind of shock.

It was years before I could take a shower and not re-experience that state of fright again.

Maybe you had to be there to understand this.",10
10 July 2001,"If anyone has ever made a perfect movie, this is it.","Made with the crew from his popular TV show, Alfred Hitchcock filmed PSYCHO in B/W in the midst of the height of his color classics -- REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, DIAL M FOR MURDER, TO CATCH A THIEF and THE BIRDS. But it is PSYCHO that has become synonymous with Hitchcock. It is PSYCHO that has become synonymous with screaming and blood and knives and schizophrenia and horror.

If ever anybody has made a perfect movie, PSYCHO is it. It is the penultimate in shocking horror, a directorial masterpiece supported by acting that will never be surpassed. The stars aligned for this movie, and it is doubtful if a movie can ever surpass the greatness of this film.

The points have been hashed and rehashed over and over again: Perkins' incredible acting, the plot twists, the sheer twistedness of the movie, the place it holds as the father of the modern horror movie. All of it amazing.

No scene has been more popular in the annals of film than the shower scene (Oh sure, GONE WITH THE WIND and CASABLANCA and CITIZEN KANE have memorable lines, but what movie has a minutes-long scene that is internationally famous?). Unfortunately, its notoriety makes it somewhat of a disappointment to watch now, but repeat viewings reinforce the technical beauty of the scene where the original horror was lost.

But enough, as anything said will only add more hype to a movie that does not need it. PSYCHO is quite simply the perfect movie, a film that could possibly stand forever as the best ever made.",10
11 November 2019,Psycho,"Psycho is the iconic horror movie that created the slasher genre. This seminal film has influenced everything from Halloween to Scream. It has a great script, great direction by Hitchcock, an iconic score by Bernard Herrmann, and a chilling turn by Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. The only weak link is the exposition dump delivered by the psychiatrist in the last ten minutes of the film I found it totally superfluous. Now I know the monologue was meant to explain Norman Bates's pathology but it comes across as way too expository. I guess audiences back in 1960, needed to have that monologue to understand Norman Bates' psychosis. In today's climate movie goers are far more sophisticated, so I guess that speech was acceptable back in 1960. Anyway I digress, Psycho is a great horror movie that every film fan should check out.

26 June 2014,A Masterpiece,"Is Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho a masterpiece? In short yes, and is one movie to define a genre for decades.

Psycho is the story of a young woman running from a bad decision. The film begins with Marion Crane stealing forty thousand dollars from her employer. On the run from a team of private investigators she comes across the Bates Motel, a hotel in the middle of nowhere ran by Norman Bates. Norman lives alone with only his mother, a mentally disturbed woman. This simple story will progress into one of the most thrilling films of the twentieth century.

Alfred Hitchcock directs this terrifying tale with expertise; no detail is left to wonder with all credit due to this monumental director. The script is also top notch with every scene feeling unique and engrossing. I have to say there is one scene in particular that will forever haunt my imagination. To compliment the excellent direction is solid performances by all of the actors, the standout being Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates.

This masterpiece of the cinema is in every way phenomenal, it will leave you terrified to take a shower and in awe of the plots complexity.",10

30 December 2018,The Best Film,"I read the book, well, short story, by Robert Bloch. Many changes made in the film, including the appearance of Norman Bates. The film makes him quite a looker, whereas the book he is obese and ugly. Hitchcock took a story and made it his masterpiece. Scary from start to finish, keeping you on the edge of your seat and asking yourself questions like, Are there people like Norman Bates in my world? Masterly filmed in Black and White with a cracking music score that makes it even more impairing. Hitchcock funded the film himself by mortgaging his house, as none of the film companies believed in Psycho. Nearly sixty years later and it is one of Hitchcock's best films. Watch out next time you are in the shower in a hotel room .......

10 August 2003,The Original Slasher Pic,"This has got to be one of the scariest films in the history of cinema. Anthony Perkins was perfectly cast as the demented mama's boy Norman. He was chilling as he looked like just your average person, until the mother side of his personality took over and he became, probably, the most famous serial killer in film history (at least until Hannibal Lecter came along thirty years later). Also, this film proved that you could have a great slasher film without being overly gory. This is definitely Hitchcock's masterpiece.

10 April 2010,A classic in every sense of the word.,"It's hard to imagine a black and white movie from 1960 with no cursing, no blatant violence, and very little action, being epic, but Psycho definitely deserves that description.

Even with a basic prior knowledge of what was going to happen, I was still completely enthralled by the whole thing. It takes several different turns in tone and content throughout, but it's all consistently well done. There are very few better examples of the words thriller and mystery than this one. I used to absolutely hate older movies, but Psycho is proof that all the things that I love about movies now, were alive and well many years ago. I was absolutely startled and freaked put a few times during the film, and that's one of the finest compliments that I can give.

8 May 2019,Still the greatest horror movie today!,"Psycho was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and was released on June 16th 1960. It was such an iconic scene which made Hitchcock known as a master of making such a horror masterpiece. It wasn't just a horror movie, it was also a thriller and a mystery which made us really curious about the crimes. We always wanted to know who commited it, who was the victim and what clues were left behind. It was about a Phoenix secretary embezzles forty thousand dollars from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. Hitchcock's Studio, Paramount Pictures, wasn't sure enough and disliked the film so they denied him a proper budget and the it was $800,000. The movie was in black and white. They even built a Bates Motel mansion at Universal. Psycho was Hitchcock's best work while he had done some thrillers and horrors like Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963). All of those were one of Hitchcock's greatest works. Hitchcock also made rules for audiences for watching this film. ""You must see PSYCHO from the very beginning. Therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. We say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager's brother, the President of the United States, or the Queen of England (God bless her)!"" -Alfred Hitchcock- They were really strict and lucky for me, I'm not a person from the 60s so I can watch whenever I want. The performances were excellent and I mostly like Anthony Perkin's role of Norman Bates. Perkins was good-looking and that's exactly how Hitchcock wanted it to be just like that so Bates would look like a very likeable person with a charming character and made audiences believe him. They would think about him. Bates even disguised before he kill so that the victims would think it wasn't Bates maybe? He could have not dress because the victims would be dead and they wouldn't know. The way the iconic scene: the shower scene was pretty scary with its noise and when Marion Crane opened her eyes dying made the scene more terrifying and the way she was buried in the swamp was mostly frightening. She was naked and her things were in there. I knew it would be a good idea to bury your victim like that. What a genius! The story was told in a unique way. Even though the movie didn't have much violence, but the mystery were also dreadful and made us worry about what really had happened. It's also a great idea to shoot this movie not in technicolor but still remained black and white. That way would make Psycho a horror masterpiece no one could make like that. Psycho was really influential, the greatest work of Alfred Hitchcock and also the greatest horror movie and it still deserved that title until today, it's still terrifying and scared a lot of audiences. It's also a combination of horror, terror, violence, mystery and thriller. I would recommend this a must-see for horror fans.

My ratings: 9.7/10",9
26 December 2020,Still one of the scariest films to date; Hitchcock's best film,"Psycho is an extremely suspenseful, scary and wonderful film. For being filmed in Black and White, it also has an artistic feel to it like all Hitchcock films. The acting, dialogue and filming in this film are fantastic, something that feels it shouldn't be out of 1960 but is. At the end, (which I won't spoil) I was absolutely shocked, to say the least I didn't see it coming.

Psycho is easily Hitchcock's best film and if you haven't watched it I would highly recommend.

8 July 2001,Quite possibly the greatest film of all time!,"""Psycho"" stands alone in the realm of horror and thriller movies. It is one of the few that delivers to fear and feeling into the misbegotten souls of it's characters. Director Alfred Hitchcock delivers superb direction and forces you to put your trust in ""Psycho""'s many seedy characters. Anthony Perkins delivers the performance of a lifetime as Norman Bates, the poor pawn of his 'mother'. The film, brilliantly shot in B&W, has become a staple in any movie lover's eye. The entire story revolves around the theft of 400,000 by one Marion Crane(Janet Leigh). This theft entangles her sister(Vera Miles), her lover(John Gavin), a private eye(Martin Balsam), a sheriff(John McIntire), and a lonely hotel manager(Perkins). ""Psycho"" is capable of being rewatched over and over again with little secrets hidden through out. Each character holds some secret: Marion stole some money, Gavin is seeing her on the side, Marion's coworker took tranquilers on her wedding night, her boss has alcohol in the office, client holds undeclared money from the IRS, and Norman has the biggest sequel of all. ""Psycho"" also contains the greatest score of all time which contains only strings which was wonderfully composed by the late Bernard Hermann as well as the best directed scene of all time, the infamous shower scene. I believe ""Psycho"" is the greatest film of all time. I give it a 10/10.",10
4 October 2021,Creepy Psychological Thriller!,"""Psycho"" is a 1960 thriller film, directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock, and is an extremely weird and creepy movie but is excellently done. It's about a secretary who steals 40,000 pounds from her boss and while on the run stops at the only motel she can she through the pouring windshield Bates Motel, and the owner of the hotel has a unusual relationship with his mother. The movie is extremely famous and is probably Hitchcock's most notable film of his career.

The acting, Plot, and movie in general is amazing, it was based of a book in 1959 and nowadays Psycho is still watched to this day and is enjoyed by many people who view it.

10/10!

19 March 2022,A Vintage Masterpiece. A real must see.,"If you have not seen movie, do yourself a favor watch it. I have seen this movie three times and plan to see it three more. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new such as a detail or some clue in dialogue. One of the best 'horror' movies, proving that this genre doesn't have to be graphic.

12 June 2002,Alfred Hitchcock's Best,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
20 March 2021,This film earns every word of its praise!,"Some all-time famous cult classics don't live up to expectations. You watch them and think, ""...just a tiny bit overrated"", shrugging off the disappointment. Psycho is not one of those films. This film has rightly earned every single positive review, critical acclaim, new generation of fans, all of it - not to mention having aged like fine wine. As this site's other reviews so aptly point out, if you haven't seen it yet, for heaven's sake stop reading the reviews and get on it!

Anthony Perkins is outstanding. The plot is outstanding. The atmosphere and cinematography are outstanding. The music is a particularly outstanding standout. Hitchcock tends to pull off winners anyway (please see Rope, Dial M For Murder, and The Birds) but this is a particularly marvellous one. It's worth watching just for that final scene alone! Good luck trying to forget that.

22 November 2018,Very boring.,"This movie is so bad that I almost would've thought that I watched the wrong movie if it hadn't been for the opening credits. Are all these positive reviews fake? Has no one that has seen this movie also seen a good horror movie? Are people really that easily manipulated? I don't know. I'm going to try to avoid any spoilers in my review of this mess, as people seem to care about it, but honestly there is so little to this movie that there isn't really anything to spoil.

The first hour of this movie is extremely boring. Everything is dragged out to pad the runtime. The entire opening scene doesn't even have anything to do with anything that happens after. Towards the middle of the movie, there is a scene in a shower that is so poorly edited and acted that it left me laughing hysterically. I'm pretty sure the scene was supposed to be scary, but honestly I can't see anyone being on the edge of their seat from a performance like that. After that scene, a detective character shows up, and he is kind of interesting, but he dies after less than 10 minutes, so it's kind of pointless. The movie remains mildly entertaining after that, but it's not amazing or anything.

The main thing that makes me hate this movie is the closing scene. The truth about the villain is revealed in an exposition dump that lasts like 5-10 minutes. The reason why I don't like it is because this could've been a very interesting plot point that could've been developed over the course of the movie, but is instead just relegated to a plot twist. If we had spent the movie following a villain like that, it would've been really interesting, or maybe even scary. You could say that they didn't do this because they were focusing on the victims, but this movie has no character development. No one grows over the course of the movie, and you don't learn about the personalities or backstories of pretty much anyone.

The filmmaking is ok. It's competant. Nothing special. The only interesting shot that stands out is one around a staircase. That's it.

Overall, this is a really boring, pointless, and meandering movie with a wasted concept. The only reason why anyone is praising this is because people like Alfred Hitchcock. Or they're just easily scared? I don't know. I really don't recommend watching this one.",4
1 August 2007,Strictly for all the psychos based all over the world,"After having heard all the noise surrounding this film,I decided to watch this film as I had to give a presentation of a Stephen Rebello's book based on this film for my teacher Monsieur François Thomas at Cinema studies section of the University of Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle. I was utterly disappointed as this film was not so chilling as I had expected it to be.Psycho is more of a character study of some oddball persons.In the beginning Hitchcock takes us on a guilt trip of a woman who is in love with a married man.Funny thing is that both of them know that they cannot find any happiness in their so called secret love.Later on we are taken for a ride as this bizarre woman steals a lot of money and without any rhyme nor reason decided to leave her hometown.Now everybody knows what happens after that.Psycho is a film about matter of taste. It might have appealed to the people of the sixties with their fascination for things black and white.But Psycho does not make any sense in the colored era of 2007.

When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
16 January 2009,"Great movie, greater soundtrack","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

4 November 1998,"Creepy, Excellent, and Amazing Horror Flick! Best Thriller Ever!!","The first time I saw this movie it scared me incredibly. I have been an avid fan of the ""Scream"" movies since they first came out, and I must say, this movie surpasses them to be #1 on my favorite horror movies.

I wasn't expecting many scares from a movie made in 1960, but once again, Alfred Hitchcock proves why he is the Master of Suspense.

I don't know how the upcoming remake can accurately mimic the original's creepy and frightening feeling, but I'll still be there on opening weekend. BTW, make sure you watch the original BEFORE watching the remake.

I know you've heard it a thousand times, but if you haven't seen this movie, MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY! It's simply incredible.

1 October 2014,Rightfully considered one of the all time horror masterpieces.,"(Halloween Horror Reviews #1)

To Begin my rush of October horror reviews, I will now cover one of the most iconic and acclaimed horror films ever. Alfred Hitchcock's often imitated, but never matched, Psycho.

To start, the film has possibly one of the tightest screenplays ever written. Innumerable twists, plays on the audiences expectations and elegant little subversions upon itself make the plot come alive and dazzle like a firecracker. I mean it when I say that 54 years after its release the rest of the genre is still trying to catch-up Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch's masterpiece of a screenplay. However, the way Hitchcock delivers this script is also incredible. Small visual hints and tricks make the film a joy to re-watch. For example, we see a woman in white underwear, later in the film she wears black underwear to show that she has committed an impure act. Such tiny details, but the impact is massive on the whole.

Next the acting. Anthony Perkins delivers one of the most effective 'creepy' performances of all time. Like the screenplay it too has not been matched in 54 years and remains the yardstick for all psychopathic portrayals in film. Aside from Perkins however, the rest of the cast give strong performances, particularly Janet Leigh in the 'starring' role.

The set design is legendary. Such mundane and simple locations are brought to life by the films exquisite lighting and use of shadows. The house in the background to the main set looms like a falcon, and casts a shadow over all the preceding events. You feel like someone is watching you at all times, and are constantly on edge. Such simple images as a stuffed bird, or a tall staircase are used so effectively here. This film remains an icon on minimalist set design, and how to creep your audience out with the simplest of imagery.

Overall I cannot praise this film enough. One of the most iconic and brilliant films, from one of the most iconic and brilliant directors of all time.

Happy Halloween.",10
6 August 2005,"Hitchcock's best film, by far","Hitchcock was a masterful director... no one can deny his talent for creating and sustaining suspense. He had a gift for making memorable and impressive films, and Psycho is without a doubt one of the most well-known and popular. One of the reasons is of course the famous shower scene, but that's only one of many memorable and well-done sequences. The reason we remember that particular scene is not only how nicely filmed, tightly edited and effective it is... but also how credible it is. We believe in it, despite how little it shows of what it depicts, we believe that it happens, despite all we see is innuendo and hinting. The plot is great. Entirely credible and realistic. The whole film is psychologically accurate. The acting is superb, particularly Anthony Perkins. The pacing is great; you're hardly ever bored. The writing is excellent, both as far as story and dialog go. There are plenty of quotable lines. What makes this film work so well is how realistic and believable it is. What makes it shocking is how surprising it is. What makes this film have such an impact is that it's perfectly credible. I won't reveal any more, in case anyone reading this review don't know the twist of the film. If you are one of those people, watch this before you're told of it. It's incredible. I recommend this to any fan of horror, thriller and/or Hitchcock. 10/10",10
22 December 2004,The mother of all horror movies,"Anthony Perkins plays a motel keeper Norman Bates, whose mother has a huge control in his life.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) ends up to his hotel not knowing what's going to face her... Psycho (1960) is directed by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980).That man really knew what people liked.The acting work is superb.Perkins (1932-1992) is perfect in the lead.Janet Leigh is brilliant as the troubled woman.Sadly this wonderful actress passed away October 3rd at the age of 77.She is greatly missed by many.Vera Miles (1929-) plays Marion's sister Lila and does a great job.She was also in the second part 23 years later (there were four in total).John Gavin (1928-) is Marion's boyfriend Sam Loomis.Hitch thought Gavin's acting was wooden and referred to him as ""The Stiff"".I have to give him more credit than that.The director himself pops in as Man in cowboy hat.His daughter Patricia (1928-) is seen as Caroline. There are many scenes to remember.Who could ever forget the shower scene after seeing it once? This is a movie that won't age.It's been nearly 45 years since it was made but still it works as good as it did back then. They can't make movies like this anymore.People can try but they won't succeed.Psycho is an ultimate classic that every movie lover just must watch.But first, ask your mother...",10
11 April 2002,What else can be said?,"This film is classic,inside and out.The top thriller of all cinematic time.I don't think any arguments can be made against that.This is indeed Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.I'm struggling for words here because I'm not sure I can say anything that anyone hasn't read a thousand times over.If you have not seen it,don't put it off any longer.You'll never close your eyes in the shower again.That is,if you don't decide to just take baths from now on.I mean,if a scene is done so effectively,that Janet Leigh herself refuses to go anywhere near a shower to this day,it just doesn't get any better than that,folks.Rent it! See it! This classic film should never be overlooked.

31 May 2000,"In my opinion, Psycho is definitely one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, if not THE greatest.","Psycho is one of the few films that have created countless numbers of spinoffs and attempted duplications. Anthony Perkins was perfect as the timid and charming but psychotic Norman Bates, and Hitchcock's direction molds Robert Bloch's novel into a timeless thriller that is as satisfying to someone seeing it for the first time as to someone who has seen in 50 times.

Even though I am a pretty serious film fanatic, I did not see Psycho for the first time until late 1998 - I actually saw the re-make first. I enjoyed that film, and decided to finally see the original to see what was so great about it. Psycho made a tremendous impact on me, and it was the only movie I have ever seen that I wanted to rewind and watch again as soon as it ended.

Excellent acting, amazing psychological direction by Alfred Hitchcock, the most famous murder scene in film history, and Bernard Herrman's hypnotic score all come together in Psycho to produce a truly wonderful and intense cinematic experience.",10
4 March 2001,The best film of all time!,"When Alfred Hitchcock started to direct this film in 1959, he could have had no idea that a film starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh could bypass the brilliance of his films starring James Stewart (Vertigo, The Man Who Knew too Much and Rear Window). But how wrong he was...

""Psycho"" went on to become the highest grossing black and white film of all time, (In a time when colour films were already popular) the highest grossing horror film of all time and the highest grossing Alfred Hitchcock film of all time. The film made Anthony Perkins a superstar, but sadly, this was more harming to his career than uplifting, as the movie-going public always have (and always will) only seen him as Norman Bates, and nobody else. This was concurred as Perkins never again made a film of real value, but in 1983 ""Psycho 2"" was a huge hit for Universal Pictures. Janet Leigh on the other hand, went on to make a few well done done films in her respect.

About the film: Anthony Perkins' performance as the stuttering Norman Bates is in my opinion the greatest film performance of all time. His nervous, boyish acting style brings a simple charm to the character, and he even succeeds in creating a sympathetic approach from the public. He even succeeds in hiding his character's madness, and couldn't do it better. Janet Leigh is perfect as the thief, and you even have more sympathy for Norman as for Marion. The rest of the cast, (John Gavin - Sam Loomis; Vera Miles - Lila Crane; Martin Balsam - Milton Arbogast and John McIntire's Sheriff Chambers) are all as good as it gets, but no one matches Anthony Perkins performance. Sorry to say, but John Gavin is miscast. He looks too gentle, too moral to ever cheat on his wife. This is the only bad thing about this cinema classic.

The classic shower scene not only created a single shock, but a film memory to haunt for generations to come. Alfred Hitchcock filmed this scene with great care and delicacy. You can sense this with the fact that not a finger is out of place, and even Janet Leigh still showers in fear.

I was disgusted when I learned that Perkins wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award, because he should have won it! He wasn't nominated for ANY prize of ANY kind, and to crown it all, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. Well deserved, I should think, but Perkins was the real reason that the film reached such success, not Leigh, nor Hitchcock.

I salute both Anthony Perkins and sir Alfred Hitchcock for what they've done for film history, and for the fact that there will be only one Tony Perkins, and one Alfred Hitchcock.",10
27 December 2006,It's the best horror of all time,"Psycho is as about as thrilling as a film can be.

We start off by seeing a normal woman, Marion crane, who decides to steal $40,000 dollars from her boss. She fleas from her normal lifestyle and stops in a quite and tranquill motel. The bates motel. She is murdered in the shower by a shadowy figure in a now famous scene.

Her sister and boyfriend are troubled by her disappearance and question the Bates owner, Norman. He denies killing her and the mystery leads of into a startling climax.

The acting is fantastic and the thrills are non-stop. The only other horror that has come close is Halloween(and maybe alien).

Psycho is the best horror of all time. period.",10
29 October 2019,A masterwork in suspense and still one of the scariest films ever made.,"Psycho manages to do what few horror movies, even modern ones fail to and genuenly shocks. With so many twists and turns Psycho keeps you on the edge of your seat. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is one of the most iconic characters not only in Horror, but movies in general.

24 June 2002,The Most Beautiful Piece of Art In Horror Making.,"This is truly the best horror film ever made. Any horror fan who dislikes this classic has to be paranoid. This is Alfred Hitchcock's most beautiful peice of work that I have seen. Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and Janet Leigh were all brilliant. I know most old black and white films don't get much of a look, and that's why I think Gus Van Sant had the idea of remaking Psycho, with the same lines and the same way the scenes were shot in 1960, so people could enjoy a movie that is more from their time. This is the best horror film ever made in Hollywood. I give Psycho a 1,000,000 out of 10!!!!!! :)

22 April 2020,That Shower Scene,"For those of us born in the 90's or later I can guarantee you know what I'm about to describe. The dramatic orchestral music, a woman stabbed in the shower, and a zoom in shot of the blood running down the shower drain. It's been imitated and referenced for decades and for good reason. While compared to the gore and ""realistic"" murder and horror scenes in films today its far from...well it's a little cheesy. But the film captures and puts you on edge somehow. The dramatic and dark scenery combined with the intense musical score is perfection. Theres not much else I can say that won't sound like repetition so I'll just give it my stamp of approval and a 10/10 would recommend.

His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
4 April 2010,Not to be confused with the 1998 film of the same name (as if).,"Psycho is undoubtedly Alfred Hitchcock's most famous film, and not for no reason: it's a masterclass in suspense, tension and terror that, even half a century after it first stunned audiences with its raw, psychological horror, has lost none of its ability to shock.

For those who don't already know, Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, creepy proprietor of the Bates Motel, situated off the old highway 15 miles from the town of Fairvale. Janet Leigh is bank employee Marion Crane, who has let temptation get the better of her and absconded with $40,000. Feeling tired after a long trip on the road to visit her lover Sam Loomis (John Gavin), Marion decides to check into the Bates establishment, where she meets a sticky end whilst taking a shower (c'mon, don't tell me you didn't know...).

When Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) travels to Fairvale to see if Sam knows anything of her sister's whereabouts, she is tailed by private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), whose expertise eventually leads him to the Bates motel where Norman and 'mother' wait with butcher's knife in hand.

Working from a script by Joseph Stefano (based on the novel by Robert Bloch), Hitchcock delivers a flawless exercise in horror that sees the director develop techniques so effective that they are still imitated to this day, but which are rarely as well executed as they are here. Hitchcock's finest achievement with Psycho is undoubtedly fooling his audience into assuming that Leigh is the central character and then suddenly bumping her off, metaphorically pulling the rug from under the viewers feet; but he also manages many other brilliant touches, including Marion Crane's tense flight from Phoenix, where she imagines how events are unfolding at the bank, Norman's disposal of Ms Crane's car in a swamp (with her body in the boot), a moment of wonderful dark humour as the vehicle momentarily refuses to sink, and of course, the macabre ending in which Lila discovers Norman's mother hiding in the fruit cellar.

Add a cool title sequence by Saul Bass and a fantastic score by Bernard Hermann, itself often imitated, and what you have is a bona fide classic of the horror genre (yes, horror) that any self respecting fan should ensure that they see at least several times. It's that good.",10
17 January 2008,A major classic!,"Definitely a major classic! This film by Hitchcock is for sure one of the major classics of all times in movies' history. The argument is very good, the plot is well constructed and if we forget about the dated production we really have a great film.

It's a mystery-horror story that grabs you until the end. Of course that I already knew the final twist even before watch it (because of this film being so fairly known), so it wasn't really a surprise; but I guess that if I was seeing it for the very first time without knowing anything about the movie it would be different I bet I would be surprised!

Anyway, the story is good, the characters are quite known (who didn't heard about ""Norman Bates""?!), the acting is fine and the soundtrack is a classic! Fantastic! Those string sounds are effective to create suspense!

There's no doubt that this movie is ""the father"" of the modern horror! It clearly inspired many horror movies from the 70's and 80's and is still being a reference!",8

14 May 2006,Janet Leigh - Hiding In Plain Sight,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion.

19 April 2003,One of the best thrillers,"Hitchcock was a master of his art, and this thriller is an evidence of it. Again a good black and white film with an extraordinary plot starred by Anthony Perkins, who was perhaps the best actor in roles of mad or abnormal people in the world cinema. To this we should add the supporting roles played by then still beautiful Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, Vera Miles and John Gavin. But again Perkins was simply excellent. We all were afraid without seeing the killer and until the end we supposed as real the existence of Norman Bates mother. A thriller is good when the end is unknown and even unsuspected by the public, and these requirements are well accomplished by Hichtcock.

28 September 2003,Simply brilliant,"Psycho is perfect in all aspects despite, or perhaps, because it was very unconventional (I cannot discuss this in detail without giving away a lot of the plot). The pure craftsmanship of the film is a joy to behold. The casting was perfect, there were plenty of surprises and needless to say scares, the music was very evocative, and in certain contexts there was even a great deal of humor. I think Hitchcock said somewhere that it was a comedy! Maybe he meant it in jest. Unlike a lot of films which fade from memory as soon as you leave the theater or take out the DVD, Psycho stays in your mind. Highest recommendation 9/10.

26 February 2005,Excellent,"This had to be Alfred Hitchcock's best movie. In fact, it was my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie. This movie was perfectly executed by Hitchcock. The acting was unbelievably tremendous. Each actor did an excellent job(especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh). The screenplay was great and the writing was tremendous. It's a movie about a woman(Leigh) who is out driving on a rainy night(after stealing a lot of money) and she stops at a motel where the owner has a mother, but is very lonely and befriends her. When she takes a shower, the figure of an old lady walks in and stabs her to death in the shower(this is remembered as the famous ""shower scene""). This was excellent and I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.

29 April 2005,Classic,"I was first introduced to Alfred Hitchcock when I was very young, however, it was not until now that I knew what a monumental influence he had on film. In my college film class we had the chance to view Psycho and i have to admit at first, i was not extremely excited about it. However, I was hooked in the first five minutes of the film and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I love psychological thrillers that make you wonder and think ""outside the box"" and i think this was one of the best i have ever seen. I think that Alfred's choices for the movie, (director, characters, etc.) were great. I thought all the characters did a fabulous job. The story line and plot were very creative too. I felt like i was being surprised every five minutes. I also like that this is an old black and white film. I don't think that it would have had the same impact on me if it was a modern story in color. It is definitely a classic!

7 June 2022,My second favourite film,"What can I praise about this phenomenal film that hasn't been said before over the last 62 years? It is so beautifully crafted. Everything about this film, all elements are a 10/10 in my opinion. I'm gonna start with the acting; Anthony Perkins does such an amazing job at portraying Norman bates. All the small nonverbal nuances of his performance such as the clenching of his jaw or his aversion of his eyes all come together to bring out this very socially inept and nervous character who you can't help sympathise with but at the same time get a sense of despair and darkness. Not to mention his delivery of his lines during tense scenes which make you question his character and keeps adding to the suspense Hitchcock so brilliantly creates.

Perkins' actual appearance is also works incredibly well for the character as he looks to be a harmless and slender motel owner but that couldn't be further from the truth. Janet Leigh plays the role of Marion Crane who ends up in trouble with the law and is on the run to escape the 'private trap' she's put herself in. Her performance is equally as good as Perkins and they both contrast greatly to eachother which once again ads to the suspense that underpins the the film. She has such a soft and articulate way of speaking, making her appear to be very intellectual which makes her slow downfall that much more devastating and shocking. The score for this film from the opening credits which runs all throughout the run time every now and then at key scenes is just so perfectly used and I genuinely feel tense hearing it on its own so when it is combined with a thrilling scene it just exponentially increases the feelings going through my head. Now don't get me started on the cinematography for this film as I could go on for ages about how visually stunning and actually groundbreaking some of the shots are. One interesting fact I like is that Psycho was the first film to show a toilet flushing and it was regarded as being vulgar at the time. Obviously there's the iconic shower scene which is famous for a reason. I believe the budgetry constraints Hitchcock had actually improved the scene for me. The blood as chocolate sauce and the sound effects of a knive stabbing a melon which works very well and definitely holds up even today as the cutaways from the action make it that more intense and disturbing as you are forced to imagine more of what is happening. The overall plot is thought provoking and keeps you hooked into the story right from the first shot in Phoenix to the very end. Hitchcock's use of cause and effect logic is the main reason this film's events connect and play out so well together. The fact that Sam mentions to Marion about needing money means that we know as an audience they have money troubles and only a few minutes later a rich man buying a house places 40k dollars right in front of Marion almost taunting her financial situation.

To conclude you are certainly going to do yourself a disservice not watching this film.",10
16 February 2023,My favorite horror movie,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is spectacular without any visual effects or screams, it is capable of making me tense, and also the soundtrack is exceptional.

A very good story, beginning, middle, and end. And the twist at the end is incredible and well-built. Besides, the name ""Psycho"" is perfect and very well-founded. I really liked the actors, especially and obviously Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).

This film has also given us one of the most iconic scenes in cinema in general, the bathroom scene. And apart from small details, such as Marion's underwear changes from white to black after committing the robbery.

1 August 1998,Alfred Hitchcock's Best Thriller ever made,"I've heard so much about this film before I watch it. Luckily i didn't know the ending of this film, if not, things would be so different. I think this is one of Hitchcock's best movies. If you've seen the film, you'll know that this kind of plot could easily turn out to be banal. This revealed the splendid skills of Hitchcock in handling such kind of movies. Apart from this, i must say that Anthony Perkins did very well. He was made for the role of Norman Bates. This is my favourite film of all times. Everyone who hasn't seen it yet, better watch it NOW.

Todays horror flicks don't even compare to the timing, and the cleverness of Psycho. My best friend doesn't even like Hitchcock, but he liked this movie. I wish the Oscars could've said the same. This movie is one of a kind.

31 October 2002,Everyone has seen it,"A movie that everyone has seen at one time or another. Great movie but (I might get burned for this) but a bit overrated. Don't get me wrong- I love this movie but there are others equally deserving of attention. Anthony Perkins is outstanding as good old Norman Bates- the stuttering (also used in 1948's Rope) is an outstanding touch. The shower scene is not extremely violent but none-the-less very effective especially for that time period. In fact, one of the things I love about all Hitchcock movies is he knew what to show and what not to show (not like in today's show everything society). If you haven't seen this, go out and rent it- great film!

30 July 2015,Hmm;,"A lot of people have different opinions on this, mines rather mixed. There is only one bit of this movie i didn't fully understand (and I may sound completely dumb for mentioning it, it's probably something rather easy to understand!) but in the film, the male hotel keeper carry's his mother down the stairs after asking her to hide and you can see him carry his mother down stairs but later on in the movie the policeman says he dressed up as his mother and acted like her etc? If that's so, who was the women that he carried down the stairs? All in all, it's an alright movie, most of the women really reminded me of Marilyn Monroe It's a good old horror though! :)

29 May 2023,The ultimate classic film,"This is definitely one of my all time favorites among the classics. It still holds up even in 2023. The acting and cinematography in an all black and white film is mesmerizing. It's satisfying and well done. It's not scary for a typical ""horror"" film yet it has a nice plot twist that some may see coming but it is so well down that even if you do see it coming then you can still appreciate it. I love how the ending is full circle. It explains everything and leaves you not wondering what if or how. Everything is spelled out for you. It makes it so satisfying. The music is also classic and beautiful and memorable. I love this movie and it is rewatch-able over an over again. A semi slow burn but yet captivating and well done!

2 September 2005,Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of horror,"Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of horror, this is the landmark film that stretched the boundaries of what could be shown in a suspense film. It's the story of Norman Bates, a momma's boy who runs a decrepit motel with his invalid mother. When Janet Leigh steals a bundle of cash that she is supposed to deposit in the bank she has no choice but to split town. Unable to continue to drive in a blinding thunderstorm, she loses her way off the main road and ends up having to spend the night at the Bates Motel.

The infamous shower scene has been talked about ever since it scared the heck out of everyone who saw it and some women were so frightened they couldn't take a shower for days afterward. Even after all these years there are still some people who haven't seen this film and refuse to see it.

The house behind the motel where Norman lives with his mother is a masterpiece of set design built at 3/4 scale to make it look more ominous, and it sure does look ominous.

Anthony Perkins is totally convincing as the loner mama's boy.

The movie was filmed by a TV crew in black and white which was a total departure from Hitchcock's widescreen VistaVision color films such as Vertigo.

This is a movie that you can see many times and always take away something new. Once again Hitchcock creates a film that can be read on different levels.

If you like Hitchcock's films and think Psycho is just another horror film, read the excellent analysis of the movie in Daniel Spoto's ""The Art of Alfred Hitchcock."" It'll open your eyes to what Hitchcock was doing and immensely increase your appreciation of his films.",10
8 October 2020,Brillant horror masterpiece,"There always will be a before and a after Psycho in the cinema history. And besides of being one of the best, if not the best, Hitchcock productions, Psycho is an absolute, timeless, masterpiece for sure. Btw I think the film offers us one of the most iconic scene of all time. (the bathroom scene) And I REALLY wanna talk a little bit about Anthony Perkins's mind-blowing performance as the psychotic character Norman Bates. I mean this guy didn't even win an Oscar for that role. Wtf ? Nothing more to say more. Just The Master of Suspense himself at its best.

12 January 2001,Hitch's best,"What else can I add about this film? One of the more famous settings ever (the motel), one of the most famous movie names (Norman Bates), and of course, probably the most memorable killing on film (shower, anyone?). There's no real point in summing up again, but, what the hay. Leigh embezzels money and skips town. She ends up at a remote motel and has dinner with the owner (Perkins). Though long winded, the scene in the parlor stays captivating with the dialogue and the subtle music softly in the background. They both discuss the things wrong in their lives, his biggest problem, his domineering ""mother"" (and I always wondered if people who haven't seen the film thought of when every critic always put quotations around mother). She retires for the night, and while unwinding with a shower, is brutally knifed by some woman. The mother? You'll find out if you haven't seen it. The rest of the film deals with Perkins trying to cover up the crime, as others come looking for Leigh. I say it's Hitchcocks best, but that's mostly based on the fact that I didn't like his other movies (""Frenzy"" was ok). Performance wise, you couldn't ask for much more, as Perkins is terrifically understated as Norman, the role that pidgeon-holed the rest of his career. He pretty much carries the film as the others, good actors no doubt, have little screen time. A sequel followed 23 years later(!), one I went for more being a kid of the 80s. Part III was good as well (Perkins directed nicely), but IV was a lame made for cable film. There was also an awful remake in 98, check it out at your own risk. As far as the beginning of it all, it can be slow in spots, but is a well told story and one of only a few films before the 80s that I liked.",7
28 March 1999,You can check in...but you can't check out!,"I think this is a classic, and I am really ashamed that people think that the 1998 remake of this movie is better. Anthony Perkins has that great evil look about him for such a twisted character as Norman Bates. I even suggested to my psychology professor that we watch this movie in a our abnormal psychology class being that we are currently learning about abnormal behaviors. But anyways, I would pick the original Psycho over the remake anyday of the week!

6 December 1998,It is still scary...,"I still cannot watch the shower screen without cringing. The soundtrack is one of---if not the greatest of all time. Without it, the movie would not be half of what it is. If you've never seen this movie, then see it. But I want to warn you that every now and then you will want to peek around the curtain when you take showers.

9 December 2014,"""We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you ?""","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9

19 July 2005,This is one of Hitchcock's very best films!,"Who would dare to put Janet Leigh in the shower and let ""Mother"" stab her many times? HITCHCOCK! Who would show Janet Leigh in bra and half-slip? HITCHCOCK! Who is the master of mystery and mayhem? HITCHCOCK! Yes, it's macabre master himself, Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, British film maker who makes a film for the American audience. This man is not afraid, he is bold, brainy, and very well rounded in his work. And this movie is in my opinion, one of the best he's ever made. Janet Leigh(1927-2004) did an outstanding job playing the thieving Marion Crane. The question does puzzles me in the beginning of the film is why was she wearing white bra and half-slip?

Very kinky to start, but very interesting as well. Women like that don't wear white, supposed a downpour would occur and she wore black underneath, it would be quite embarrassing. Or is it? Other than that, she does drive over to the Bates Motel where it's run by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins,1932-92), may look sensitive, but BEWARE! He always have to listen to Mother. I say Norman needs to avoid Mother, she's a real bad influence! Bates is also a voyeur, he happens to watch Marion undress. Naughty, naughty! For a man who kills women. After he kills Marion which is most likely the most infamous scene, he would try his best for her sister, which is stopped by Sam Loomis(John Gavin). I wonder if Perkins was in to transvestitism to get the role at that time? Hmmmm! Well anyway, this is one of the few hits in the 60's that can be enjoyed for horror fans of every generation. Still for person 17 and over! All I have to say is, WATCH OUT! YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET STABBED! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rating 5 stars!",10

9 March 2008,Original Horror Classic,"This movie is what I consider to be one of the biggest movie milestones ever.

Alfred Hitchcock is truly a genius and this film alone is proof. Who knew this film would still be such a success almost 50 years later? This was a low-budget film, filmed in black and white when there was clearly color available. But the black and white makes it extra eerie. Also, the music and dark tone of the movie makes you on the edge of your seat. There are lots of small things that make the mood. Like Marion's lingerie is white in one scene but black during a much more eerie scene. The storyline is fairly simple but in 1960 was very original. Nowadays, every wannabe movie has the same idea but this is the movie it all originated from. The kills are very VERY memorable. Particularly the first one. Even 50 years later they are remembered.

I must say, this movie shocked me more than many other much more recent horror films, not to say none others scared me but I will go so far as to say Psycho is scarier than much of the crap we see nowadays, like The Ring or The Grudge.

I recommend this film to...everyone. You cannot call yourself a movie lover if you do not see Psycho! Watch the original, not the crappy 90's version! This movie deserves a 10/10.",10
13 May 2015,Hitchcock at his best,"This is a brilliant film. It takes a little bit of getting used to, it can come off as a little corny at first, but once you get sucked into it, the movie is amazing. I believe that is pretty much paved the way for every single horror movie after it. It is a testament to the genius of Alfred Hitchcock. He really understood suspense and how it effects the audience. The Shots in the is film are brilliantly planned out. They make you think exactly what you are supposed to think, until you learn what is really happening. I already knew what was going to happen when I saw this movie, yet it was still shocking. that is what makes it so great.

11 May 2015,Classic Thriller!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

7 October 2005,The master director's most important film?,"There's no denying that Alfred Hitchcock is one of the true geniuses of cinema, and Psycho is his most popular film. Whether or not it's his 'best' is up for debate; but no matter what; it's definitely up there. Psycho is the film that inspired the entire 'slasher' sub-genre, and is also a textbook example of how to make a thriller. Every shot in the film is perfectly orchestrated, and by keeping the immediate action simple; the master director is able to fully focus on the proceedings, making the resulting film more thrilling. The influence that Psycho has had on cinema overall is astounding, and it's hard to imagine cinema now without this film. The fact that over forty years on, Psycho is still better than every film it influenced is no coincidence. The plot follows Marion Crane; an office worker who is entrusted with $40,000. Seeing her chance to escape her mundane life, she takes the money and runs. Unluckily for her, she stops at a small roadside motel; The Bates Motel. Managed by a quiet young man named Norman, the remote motel has more secrets than it's appearance suggests.

Alfred Hitchcock creates a superb macabre atmosphere around the central location. Just the motel itself is frightening, without the rain effects and the psychopath that inhabits it. The master director has proved time and time again that he knows how to handle a movie; and the way that he orchestrates the surrounding here shows that implicitly. Everything about the plot is well worked, and the twist right at the centre of the film shows that. It's hard to carry off a twist like the one here and make it work, as the audience have put so much time and effort into the central character; but Hitchcock is more than equal to the challenge, and the way that he shifts the focus and still manages to retain all the intrigue is awesome to watch. The pivotal scene of the movie is, of course, the shower scene. The technicalities of this scene warrant the seven days that it took to film it, and the resulting montage represents some of the best footage ever to come out of Hollywood. I don't subscribe to the idea of 'less is more' usually, but the shower scene is so skilfully done that it's hard to not respect it.

The central character of Norman Bates is, without doubt, one of the most frightening characters in cinema history. Unlike many of the resulting slashers' killers, Norman isn't overblown or even unrealistic; you can really imagine this character being real. Of course, the excellent performance by Anthony Perkins really adds to the character. There are some actors that were made by one role, and Perkins is one of them. The rest of the ensemble work brilliantly together, with Janet Leigh providing the central character until mid-way through, when Vera Miles steps in. It's a shame, really, that Psycho is so well known because now everyone knows it's twist, so it's hard to really enjoy the movie the way that it's intended. I knew the twist already before I saw the film for the first time - so it's lucky that the movie is so good, because otherwise, already knowing what happens could have spoilt it. Overall, there's a very good reason why Psycho is one of the most respected movies of all time. There are some films that you cant be a cinema fan without seeing - and this is one of them.",10
22 January 2023,Timeless classic,"I loved the iconic Bates Motel and the house in the background shot. Such an eerie and mysterious visual pleasure. I loved the dialogues in this movie, every line is meticulously well written. Anthony Perkins' performance was outstanding in every sense, his charisma, mannerisms and the dialogue delivery were fantastic and pure talent.

20 June 2018,"Yes, a classic, but...","Although I found the film compelling enough, it is obviously a bit dated. It must have been very suspenseful at the time of release, but not by today's standards. It was a bit more of a talkie - like most films of the time. I thought Anthony Perkins was exceptionally good as Norman Bates. I found the ending not very convincing as they tried to explain the Norman Bates/Mrs Bates setup. Maybe at the time it was acceptable, but I was kind of expecting more. Nevertheless, this is indeed a classic.

25 August 2002,Wonderful! Brilliant! Genius! Fantastic! PERFECT!,"I just finished watching ""Psycho"" on TV about an hour ago, and I am still in awe. This is easily Hitch's best film ever...maybe THE best film ever. I can say this, and A) I am under 17, and B) I didn't see the whole thing. I started watching it when Janet Leigh was getting ready to leave about fifteen minutes in.

Terrific, flawless acting and directing jobs are done here. WHY DIDN'T IT WIN ANY OSCARS? I have repeatedly been asking myself this question. The adapted screenplay was awesome as well, and the ending was ABSOLUTE GENIUS (but I'm not gonna tell you what it is). My ten-year-old brother had to leave in the middle of the movie, so we taped about the last half hour (yea, I get to watch it again!), and he liked what he's seen. Now I just have to not tell him the ending...

One minor note, though: Viewers everywhere think it's a mistake that there was blood all over the wall after the shower scene, and when Norman Bates comes in there isn't. Hello, wasn't the shower still on? It could have washed off the blood.

Overall, brilliant, and yes, perfect. I have to write a novelette for literature class, and I will no doubt use ""Psycho"" as a guide to write a murder mystery. *************and more out of 10",10
16 June 2001,After 41-years it´s still very scary!!!,"a normal woman steals 40 000 dollars.She takes off on a solo car journey to nowhere.She makes a very BIG mistake and stops over the night on bates motel............................

Watch it it´s really great!!!!! rating: 5/5

9 March 2015,My Psychotic Love for this Movie,"Psycho... What can I say of the greatest thriller ever made? Only repeating what others before me have said time and time again. This is absolutely brilliant no other movie can depict such horror and schizophrenic thriller that could not possibly be remade successfully as the genius Mr Alfred Hitchcock could.

Horror today is all over the place with poor production, poor storytelling, poor filmmaking and everything else that is wrong with them. What they don't understand is that the best horror movies need the process that Psycho takes, not just gore and bloodshed but story, emotion and Psycho is how it is done right.

The perfect character development, perfect pace, excellent characters and casting and the most shady villain of all cinema history.

If you haven't seen it. Watch it. Anyone that wants to study film needs to watch this and learn what true horror is and if only producers would look at this and make horror today like it was in the old days because it truly is horror and thriller at its best.

Grade: A+ Comment: Horror made right.",10
17 April 2006,Disembodied,"Hitchcock declares up front that we're going to be on the edge of our seats while he has us captive. The music is shrill, obsessive.

We float in through the window on two lovers breaking up. A tailing police cruiser drifts out of the rear glass while we watch the girl watching her mirror. The camera floats out of the girl's dead eye, pulls back on her face frozen in fear, it swings around, pulls in on the newspaper, then swings away to the haunted madhouse on the hill. It levitates up the staircase, focuses on the 'conversation' in the next room, backs away and upwards and views the hallway straight down, all in one movement...a more impressive minute than the entire contents of many other movies.

Required film school viewing, absolutely. But also for us more casual viewers, this is a key movie we all need for understanding where visual vocabularies come from.

The later borrowings from this are uncountable. The most literal borrowing from the shower scene is in the ""Raging Bull"" Lamotta/Robinson bout, matching the cuts from angle to angle and in the same rhythm.

Brilliant vision and music, medium story and acting, though Perkins made every tic and stutter count.",7
29 October 2018,Perkins performance belongs with the All-Time great performances,"I'm sure all of you have (at least) heard of the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film, PSYCHO. And I'm sure most of you have seen (at least in part) the famous ""shower scene"". But when was the last time you really sat down and watched this film? It had been awhile for me and I walked away with the following impression:

PSYCHO is not all that scary, but it is suspenseful as heck with strong Direction by the ""Master of Suspense"" and very strong performances anchoring the front and back end of the film.

PSYCHO was billed when it came out as a ""Janet Leigh Film"". So, to give this review context, let's look at who Janet Leigh was at the time. Before shooting PSYCHO, Leigh was generally cast as the ingenue and/or love interest in mainstream fair such as LITTLE WOMEN, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD and HOUDINI (a modern ""comp"" to her might be someone like Anne Hathaway before she started doing ""edgier"" work). Leigh did show that there was more to her than just being an ingenue when she played the morally ambiguous wife of Charlton Heston's character in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL. This film (probably) gave Hitchcock the idea to cast Leigh in PSYCHO.

When 1960's audiences first saw Leigh on screen in PSYCHO, I'm sure that most of them were shocked for, instead of being the pure and wholesome ingenue and wife, she plays the entire first scene in a bra and slip. Her character, Marion Crane, is not morally ambiguous, she is morally corrupt - and when Leigh's character has a chance to act on her moral corruptness, she jumps at the chance. The rest of the first half of this film is Leigh trying to get away with her ""crime"". She is quite good in this part of the film and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (deservedly so).

And then...Anthony Perkins shows up.

We are about 45 minutes into the 1 hour and 49 minute film when Perkins' Norman Bates first appears on screen and an interesting thing happened - I couldn't take my eyes off of him. I was enjoying Leigh's performance but instantly pushed her aside (and to the background) when Perkins shows up. Without giving plot away, let me say that there is much, much going behind Norman's eyes and the performance by Perkins strongly suggests this, without going over-the-top or being melodramatic. It is a perfect blend of actor, character and performance and I was shocked that he was not even NOMINATED for an Oscar (Peter Ustinov would win for SPARTACUS). Perkins performance is one of the all-time greats with one of the most interesting and unusual characters - and portrayals - of all time.

Much of the credit for Perkins' and Leigh's strong performances have to go to Director Hitchcock who was at the height of his Directing powers (and power). From the ""get go"", you can feel the Director's hand in this film, building suspense from scene to scene and shot to shot, first with Leigh's character and, later, with Perkins. Both characters are trying to get away with something and Hitchcock pulls his camera in close to make a point - from a distance all seems good, but when you get up close, you can tell that things are very bad, indeed.

The filming of the famous ""shower scene"" is well documented and is a Master Class in film and editing. It is worth the price of admission on it's own - as is a scene on a staircase with Private Detective Arbogast, played by Martin Balsam. Hitchcock chooses to heighten the realism in this scene on the staircase by going a more esoteric route (rather than traditional filming of the events) and, one can argue, it doesn't belong in this film. Until, that is, you think about it and then it makes great sense and absolutely, positively has to be in this film in that way.

Another aspect of this film that begs to be mentioned is the Film Score by the great Bernard Herrmann - Hitchcock's regular collaborator. The music in this film punctuates the action on the screen - from the persistent beat and pacing of the opening credits music - driving the audience forward into the action - that does not let go, reaching it's peak and crescendo in the shower scene and then floating down gently like an animal catching it's breath after great activity.

Does the entire film hold up almost 60 years later? Almost...but not quite. Most annoying to me was the ""wrap-up"" scene at the end where a character spells out everything for the audience. As if we are not smart enough to ""get it"" - and perhaps the audiences in 1960 weren't.

But that is a quibble for a film that is a classic and is one that, if you have not seen (or seen for awhile), begs to be seen. Check out this film, not for the scares, but rather, the suspense that is generated by Hitchcock and his performers throughout. A GREAT entree into the world of Alfred Hitchcock films.

Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance.

We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
20 May 2023,The Ending Nobody Expected,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

18 December 2015,hitchcock,"An Alfred Hitchcock classic. My mom first showed me this when I was 13, then from then one we would re watch it whenever we got the chance. It's one of those movies were the more you watch it the more you understand about the film and why the director did this or that. And how that has affected you view of the film as a viewer. The acting of Bates was successful, because I never suspected him. I just thought he was an odd ball. And the shower scene, were he stabs the girl a hundred bazillion times is totally overdone and . . . and just perfect. Hitchcock wants us to know it's a movie, don't take it too seriously. Her screaming forever, remaining standing after each blow. He wants to scare us, but not too badly. Best Montage I have seen in a while as well.

27 December 1999,The grand daddy of them all,"I love horror films. I have reviewed all the Fridays, all the Jaws', most of the Halloweens and a few of the Nightmares. Halloween and Jaws are, to me, the two best horror films ever made. And even though I don't think Psycho is on par with some of the best horror films ever to grace our screens, you have to give credit where credit is due. Psycho is a pioneer for horror films and it is because of Psycho that we have films like Halloween and Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and directors like Hooper and Carpenter and Craven. I was born 12 years after Psycho was made and I really didn't get into film until at least another 10 years after that, but I can tell you that Psycho must have shocked and revolutionized film. Could you imagine a film maker so bold as to tell theater owners that they are not to permit anyone into the theater after it starts? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill the main character half way through the film? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill someone so graphically in the shower? Sure you can imagine all that. It's 1999. This film is almost 40 years old. But imagine what it did to audiences in 1960. It must have shocked the hell out of everyone back then. Psycho is a film like no other.

There have been films that have done it better than Psycho but none of them can say they were the first. Psycho is a great film and it is enjoyable, unlike other older films like Citizen Kane that are only listed as great because they were the first to do something but has nothing redeemable about it. Psycho is a creepy film and it gave birth to a genre and I am thankful for it because my favourite horror film has Psycho to thank for it's inspiration. Halloween uses the camera the same way Psycho did and Carpenter is a carbon copy of Hitchcock for this one film. The two films even share a common name and character, Sam Loomis.

There really isn't anything else that I want to say about the film, there are more than 100 reviews in here and many of them are by people that know a hell a lot more about the film than I do, but I just wanted to say how thankful I am that a movie like Psycho came along and paved the way for future films like The Evil Dead and Last House On The Left and such. This may be the first twisted horror film of it's kind and that is worth mentioning.

If you want to know how horror has revolutionized and evolved to the way it is today, you can look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant masterpiece, PSYCHO.",9
4 April 2016,Fantastic,"Alfred Hitchcock was the master of making films full of suspense and horror. Hitchcock is able to get into the mind of his viewers and leave them shocked and horrified that anyone could do what Norman Bates did. The title describes exactly what Norman Bates is. A psycho. Even though this movie is old school and filming has changed and improved a lot since this movie came out, I still believe today's generation can still sit and enjoy this movie. In this psychological thriller, viewers are left screaming at their T.V. screen trying to tell the characters to get out while they can. This popular 1960 horror film was so successful, there was a current television series created that is just as successful as the movie.

30 June 2000,"Hitch's 2nd Best, But That Is Saying A Whole Lot","Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is probably the best horror movie ever made, and though slightly inferior to his Vertigo, it remains a true showcase of the master's talent. Though I was not around the 1st time the movie came out, I was lucky enough to recently catch a screening of it, with a guest appearance by Janet Leigh. I had already seen the movie twice, and anticipated everything that was about to happen, but it didn't really matter. It still scared me so much, I was petrified to think how terrified I would be if I saw it in the theaters in 1960, not knowing what was about to happen. We all know the plot--Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles 40,000 dollars from her company and is on the run. She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a friendly young man who is restrained from being close to anyone but his possessive mother. They talk, and she gets in the shower. Before she is done her shower, she is stabbed to death by Norman's mother. But who really stabbed her? And is she really dead? Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Marion's boyfriend (Jon Gavin) hire detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to investigate. Then he is similarly stabbed to death before he can question Norman's mother.... Psycho is simply amazing, one of the true artistic pieces of the cinema. Joseph Stefano's disturbing, sick screenplay will not soon be forgotten, though the plot is not the main part of the movie. The cinematography is some of the best ever put on the screen, from the several pans from the Bates Motel to Norman's house to the opening shot across the city. It is dark--undeniably bleak and dark, as is the mood of the movie. The art direction is necessarily scary--Norman's house is perfectly secluded from the rest of the world, and looks very spooky, as does the motel. As Balsam notes, the hotel seems to be ""hiding from the world."" The acting varies--Balsam is quite good as the always suspicious detective, Leigh is ideally cast as the every day woman who sees a chance to get away from life and takes it, and Perkins is nothing less than fantastic as Norman Bates, a roll that would define his career, and one he will always be associated with. However, Miles and Gavin are wooden anti-characters with no personality whatsoever showing. But that really doesn't matter. Hitchcock liked the idea from the start--getting a big star and killing her off in the first reel. It certainly shocked audiences, who before came into movies whenever they wanted, sometimes even 30 minutes to an hour into the movie. They were not allowed to do that with Psycho. ""The film you should see from the beginning--or not at all"" the taglines stated. Psycho is a perfect example of audience manipulation--everyone assumes that the story is about Leigh, and when she gets bumped off, Hitchcock takes the audience down a completely different road. The shower scene is one of the most memorable and suprprising scenes in film history. The scenes in which Leigh is driving are suspenseful, even though there's nothing really happening. And when Perkins is trying to dispose of Leigh's car by pushing it into the swamp, the way the car stops sinking for a second--everyone suddenly wonders what he will do now--but then it sinks away again. Surprisingly enough, the audience wants the car to go down--we want Perkins to get rid of the evidence. And untrue to Horror formula, the climax of Psycho takes place not in a rainy dark night--but in the bright, sunny daylight. These are all examples of audience manipulation--which no one does better than Alfred Hitchcock. But yet--Hitchcock's direction, I think, is not the best part of the movie--or at least it is tied for first. The best? BERNARD HERRMANN. If you do not know that name yet, write it down. BERNARD HERRMANN. He has done the score to the Hitchcock movies Marnie, The Birds, The Wrong Man, North By Northwest, Vertigo (ohh, the Vertigo score), and Psycho. He also did the score to Scorcese's Taxi Driver, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. He won an oscar for his score for The Devil And Daniel Webster. His score for Psycho is certainly his most well known--especially the shower scene part. Though not his best (Vertigo is his best) the score is the part of Psycho that stays with you after the film is done, days after. That keeps haunting you, that keeps scaring you. Psycho would be three or four times less scary without the shrieking violins of Herrmann's score. Herrmann also pulled an exercise in audience manipulation--for the score, frightening as it is, consisted of only 4 violins. The music truly sets the mood for the movie. Creating the madness and worry in Marion's mind while she is driving, creating the true horror of the murders, and creating the calm but suspenseful serenity of some of the dialogues, where there is no music at all, and the film is eerily silent. You know the shrieking violins are soon. Bernard Herrmann's scores are not often enough credited as a huge, HUGE part Hitchcock's success with his pictures. So write that name down if you don't know it already: BERNARD HERRMANN. And see Psycho. If you've already seen it, see it again to catch the little things you missed before. I guarantee you there are some.",10
30 August 2020,Psycho,"The ""Bleak House"" under the shadow of night becomes the center of the mystery, creating a dual personality (the use of mirror image) with shadows and clever frames, and framing a split soul with segmented composition; Several close-up eyes gaze, pupil reflection, as well as the perspective of peeping, are just like the death coveting; Suspense high hanging, layer upon layer of advance, can not breathe.

The ""murder in the bathroom"" scene has become a classic in film history. It lasts 48 seconds and consists of 78 fast-changing shots. Although there is no bloody scene, its horrible effect is increased day by day.

14 September 2019,A Real Horror,"A Masterpiece By A Genius is all I have to say, this is something that everyone must see atleast once. The suspense is superb and it shows that you don't need SFX to have a good horror just a good idea. I'm only 13 and I appreciate this so much, just to think that it were made in the 1950-60s. A much watch for absolutely everyone!

6 January 2020,Nothing better than Hitchcock,"I grew up on this movie, and others like it for the lat almost 50 years. They try to remake this movie, but the only movie to watch is this one. Skip the others, THIS is the one. It's creepy and leaves you on the edge of you seat. All you young people out there should watch this one. Skip over what they call scary and watch this. It's a classic!

20 September 2018,One of the masterpieces of Cinema.,"I have reviewed the 1998 remake, so I am going to review the original. I really like it but I watched it literally right after The Birds and I felt that The Birds was more superior.

But this is still great. The remake, interestingly enough, made me like it a little more.

Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is an impressive role. His creepy smile at the end is chilling, and I will admit that Vince Vaughn could not recapture it, even though the 1998 version is one of my favorite films.

I will not discuss plot points or summarize the movie. You will know that from other reviews. And if you don't know about the infamous shower scene, then you are cinematic-ally illiterate.

But I will tell you that Psycho is worthy of the name of a classic, and if you have not seen Hitchcock's most famous work, then you should as soon as possible.

And if you take a shower and hear creepy music, then get out.",10
18 December 2015,Psycho Review,"Psycho is probably Alfred Hitchcock's most popular film, and after watching it you know why. This is a terrific film, it keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. The cinematography and camera work is legendary, the classic shower scenes come to mind. For being a product of what still known as old Hollywood, Hitchcock still manages to make it feel as if this could be a modern story. Alfred Hitchcock is described to be one of the great American film directors, and you can see why after watching this film. Psycho is truly a masterpiece through and through, from the gut wrenching sound effects,dramatic music, and epic camera angles, I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of horror thrillers.

3 April 2016,HVCC Student Yuchen Bai Review,"Overall I really enjoyed this movie, I was in face surprised by the twist ending and I really enjoyed how well done that was. For a movie of the 1960's it holds its own when compared to mystery movies of today. I think Anthony Perkin's performance was the highlight of a movie full of highlights. It's a movie that has a simple story but adds complexity through the technical knowledge of Alfred Hitchcock. Incredible music, absolute tension, amazing plot, astonishing performances, extraordinary picture etc. And also this film had the best acting during the mid 1900's and is a favorite today. I really love musical movie nowadays since i watched those fantastic works.

9 November 2020,Artistic film with an unexpected ending,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
18 August 2013,The CLASSIC Horror Film,"Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to ""torture porn"".

Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre.

Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking.

Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.

3 July 2000,"A real Hitchcock masterpiece...""She wouldn't even harm a fly.""","I was only 14 in 1960 when this movie came out, and after 40 years I finally saw it! A true Hitchcock masterpiece. You may not like the story - a pretty young woman steals $40,000 from a client and is murdered just as she decides to return the money - but you gotta like the ensuing drama and detective work. I like the way the detective ties up all the loose ends with a narrative, so you don't have to guess what actually went on in Norman Bates' deranged mind. Black-and-white photography never worked so well.

Update August 2021: I watched it again on a more recent BluRay edition with DTS sound and remastered picture, it was quite a treat. The disc also has interesting bonus features. From my public library.

29 June 2020,Hitchcock's masterpiece,"Strictly in terms of horror, there is only one movie I would rate higher than this one. That would be the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Both films were inspired by real life whacko Ed Gein. Psycho is brilliant due to Hitchcock's subtle direction. Janet Leigh sporting only a bra and slip was very much ""pushing the envelope"" in 1960. Then, on to the notorious shower scene, which creates an illusion of nudity, combined with the sheer terror of the scene. Personally, I would have liked Vera Miles better in the Janet Leigh role. Vera was much prettier and infinitely more sexy! Not only do we not see Vera in her underwear, but she never even takes her coat off! Am I going on about Vera Miles? So, I am! Beautiful lady and great actress. As for Anthony Perkins, his great performance speaks for itself. Not much else you can say without giving too much away. The movie also benefits very much from Simon Oakland's appearance as a psychiatrist.

12 May 2015,Psycho Review,"Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing thriller movie. Hitchcock kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. This movie is flawless and the cinematography is perfect. Using the shadows and covering up the killer in the shower scene was perfect. It couldn't get any better. The shower scene is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in any movie. The camera zooms in as she showering to the shadowy figure in the background. Then he opens the curtain and the score music comes on which was perfect and fit so well. While he is stabbing her his whole figure is still hidden and you can't see his face. Then he leaves the bathroom as she's dying and the camera is just focused on her hand as she is slowly dying. It was perfect and just gave me that weird feeling. I loved it. That scene describes a horror movie perfectly. The acting job too during that scene was great. She made it look so realistic and it was spectacular.

17 December 2015,Thrilling and chilling,"Psycho is one of the best thriller movies. It deserves its iconic place in movies history. Everything in this movies feels creepy. The lighting is foreboding. The strange camera angles give a sense of foreboding. The performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is what ties this film together. Bates' strange naivety yet obsessive personality is shown through his facial expressions alone. The way the tone of his voice changes when sensitive topics come up has a subtle brilliance. The film does have a few immersion breaking moments. The long overly long fall down the stairs, meant to increase suspense, instead reminds the viewer they are in fact just watching a movie. The quick explanation scene at the end breaks the mood as well. However, the film still thrills perfectly except for a very few short instances.

2 November 2017,Hitchcock's Most Famous & Profitable...Groundbreaker Prefigured the 1960's,"This Film, Alfred Hitchcock's Highest Grossing and most Famous, has been Deconstructed to Death. It is virtually Impossible for Newbies to View it Without Familiarity and it is a Film that Screams for Unfamiliarity.

Gus Van Zandt did the Art of Film No Favors and should be Ashamed of His Shot for Shot Color Remake.

But even without that ""Blasphemy"", the Movie is so Ingrained in Pop Culture that its Twists and Denouements are as Comfortable as a Warm Bed after a Shower when Viewed Today. Not So in 1960.

Conventions, Expectations, and the Experience of Movie-going were Flipped with this Low-Budget, Low-Brow Movie from a High-Budget, High Brow Filmmaker. To List the Things that were Groundbreaking would Spoil the Effect for the Folks in America that are Unaware or have Not Seen it. All 3 of Them.

Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh Star. Bernard Hermann's Score also Stars and it is Unanimous among Critics, Fans, and Hitchcock Himself that it is an Integral Part of this Masterpiece from the ""Master of Suspense"".

It sent Sparks Flying to B-Movie makers and once the Code Broke Down all Hell Broke Lose with Mario Bava's ""A Bay of Blood"" (1971) Inventing the ""Slasher"" Sub-Genre.

Hitchcock Himself was Inspired to make the Movie because William Castle's ""The House on Haunted Hill"" (1959) made so much Money and He wanted to see what He could do in the Horror Genre with a Low-Budget. Nuff Said.",10
7 February 2019,A Psychological Masterpiece,"Alfred Hitchcock is a master of suspense and wonderful storytelling, and even though Psycho is based on a book, Hitchcock makes it his own with a chilling atmosphere and memorable characters with a gorgeous soundtrack. Only from Sir Alfred Hitchcock, of course. And this one is one of the best.

11 December 2004,First rate thriller!!,"long one of my favorite thriller-dramas...made with that elusive quality rarely seen in today's films...effective subtleties...remember that Hitchcock cut costs where he could with this film....score(eliminating all instruments except strings),meager sets, but of course these all had the unforeseen benefit for the film....acting is exceptional with good close-ups of actors expressions(thinking and feeling aloud)...look for the last fade-out of Perkin's face as he sits in the police holding cell, thinking in his mother's voice and smiling wickedly into the camera...there is a brief but umistaken skull overlay on his face, a nice chilling touch at the end of the movie just before the car of Marion Crane is seen being pulled out of the bog at the movie's end. Pure genius!

20 June 2000,I'll never look at a shower the same way!,"""Psycho"" is amazing suspense and terror at it's best. It is quite possibly considered to be the grandfather of the slasher films and Alfred Hitchcock does his absolute best to keep people on the edge of their seats for the whole film. Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a secretary who embezzles $40,000 and runs off to be with her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). During a rain storm, she stops at the Bates Motel, run by a quiet young man named Norman (Anthony Perkins) and his ""mother"". She has dinner with him but ""mother"" doesn't seem to be too pleased and while Miss Marion is taking a shower, she gets stabbed numerous times in an absolutely horrific scene which doesn't lose it's effect even after 40 years. It IS scary! We then meet Lila (Vera Miles), Marion's sister who teams up with Sam and a private investigator Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam -- who also meets the wrong end of the knife), to figure out what happened to Marion. The ending is great and explains the reason why Norman acted the way he did throughout the film. This is definitely Alfred's best film. He seems to balance suspense and terror and even a little black humor here and there. Amazingly, this film spawned 3 sequels and is the best of the bunch. One of my top 5 favorites!

25 February 2005,WOW I'm impressed,"Only a week ago I sat through this movie in my English class and lets say that I was anticipating a whole lot of scares that worried me.

The way the movie switches from calm to kill works well and I like the use your imagination rather than the gore.

But the shower scene though great would have been pointless without the eeh eeh eeh music.

The other psycho score was to up, down, fast, slow and was unmemorable and unhummable.

The fact was that even though I saw the finale (lacks luster) I missed the revelations at the end (because the teacher left and people then started talking and throwing things) I want to see this movie again now! Its the only horror I've sat through other than the mummy/returns not that I'm a wuss I love scary games Half life 2 anyone?",8
20 February 2004,Genius,"This psychotic thiller is a work of genius by the director Alfred Hitchcock. Made in 1960 this film was well ahead of its time. The movie stars Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, a curious motel manager, Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, John Gavin as Sam Loomis, and John McIntire as Sheriff Al Chambers.



Psycho forever changed the way films were made in Hollywood. Alfred Hitchcock's genius shaped this masterpiece in such a way to draw the viewer in and keeping them on the edge of their own seat. With his experience in movie making, Hitchcock knows just how to influence and play with the mind.



Alfred Hitchcock is considered `The Master of Suspense,' and has earned that name rightfully. He created movies that one would have to watch over and over again in order to get all the little details of a film. Psycho is a perfect example of that, using lighting and camera angles to give the watcher a feeling of being anxious, scared, or weary of what is about to happen. One might notice that when any certain scene is shown, the camera gets closer and closer to the actor or actress's face, making it very uncomfortable to watch. Every aspect of this film is amazing for it's time, with a score that has been nominated to be one of the top 100 most influential pieces of music in American history.

Overall, I give Psycho a 9 out of 10 stars, for being a good movie in general. It's a powerful film that goes deeper than just scaring people. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves old horror classics.",9
8 January 2008,Madly the best thriller of all Time!,"A young lady, Marion,who decides to take $40,000 just received from a rich client goes on the run ending up taking refuge at a remote lonely motel and its creepy owner Norman Bates. Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, wonderfully played and delivers a fine performing main iconic role. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is very seemingly charismatic on first impressions. Yet is very troubled and eccentric. Sneaky and sideways glancing. With his strange hobby of stuffing birds. All the characters are extremely detailed. The film has so many clever aspects. Atmospheric, orchestral, suspense, the music alone provides all of these essential key areas as well as the visual side. Then there's the mysterious, nagging, possessive mother of Bates who you don't see who dominates him. Strange how bird references come up in this, Hitchcock's fascination. Loved his cameo near the start. The shower scene comprises of utter genius in how it is shot. A stabbing, thrusting, shadowy figure relentlessly going crazy with a deadly blade. Marion's outstretched hand leaving a shocking farewell to her life cruelly ripped away. A close up of her eye, the final montage. Again it's extremely clever how the whole shower scene leaves a bitter taste yet never shows us anything in the regions of graphic violence. Leaves the audience, the viewer's mind to fill in the blanks. A shocker twist regarding the killer and a final revelation at it's peak. An intelligent film from the old master Alfred Hitchcock. Best thriller ever done.",10
4 November 2020,Movie Review: HIST of American Cinema 272,"""Psycho"" is an outstanding film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and John Gavin. This Hitchcock classic doesn't disappoint, from the artistic camera angles to the great use of lighting, it gave the movie a unique texture that made it just more unsettling. Hitchcock did a terrific job directing the suspense throughout the movie which was aided by the strategic placement of the soundtrack. Another great aspect of this film was how good of a job each of the actors did. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, was painfully awkward and it made certain scenes so much more uncomfortable to watch. All in all, Psycho is a psychological thrill ride with a great plot twist.

8 April 2023,Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Why He's Awesome,"This is very much a movie of its time, released in1960: shot in black & white with stilted dialogue, wooden performances and horrendous special effects. And yet within those constraints Hitchcock was nevertheless a master. He's somehow able to elicit vicarious sympathy and suspense in viewers 60 years later, even though the big twist is already ubiquitous in pop culture. There have been several subsequent movies based on the real-life crimes of Ed Gein (most notably Silence of the Lambs), but none have come as close as Psycho to explicating the pathology of evil in simple terms without condoning it.

14 December 2013,Awesome,"An attractive woman by the name of ""Marion Crane"" (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her office then heads for California in a hurry. After being followed by a cop she pulls over at a used car dealership and trades her car for another before setting out again. That night it begins to rain hard, and she decides to stay the night at a motel along an old highway--the Bates Motel. From that point on things begin to happen in a most dramatic fashion. Now, rather than reveal the details, I will just say that this is one of the best horror movies ever filmed. It has good acting, good directing, excellent cinematography, plenty of mystery and awesome suspense. Along with that, one particular scene involving Janet Leigh in the shower is possibly one of the most memorable horror scenes ever filmed. Having said that, I believe it should be pointed out that this movie is 53 years old (at the time of this review) and as a result it doesn't have the graphic imagery or gore that some people are accustomed to today. As a result, there could be some viewers who might miss the subtle touches a real master like Alfred Hitchcock was able to implement to such a fine degree. Equally impressive was the acting of both Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (as ""Norman Bates""). As a matter of fact, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for ""Best Actress"" for her performance. In short, while this movie is definitely a bit old, it is still worth watching for all fans of horror or suspense.",9
14 November 2020,Different than the new horror movies!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

14 March 2010,A boy's best friend is his mother.,"Picking the best Hitchcock film to watch is an exercise that will totally frustrate you. There are so many great ones. When it comes to terror, no film can beat this one. Rear Window may edge it out (only by a hair) for excellence, but not for sheer terror.

I really didn't recall the humorous set up in the beginning with Frank Albertson, but it did provide a way for Oscar nominee Janet Leigh and John Gavin to finally find happiness. Hard to believe a boss (Vaughn Taylor) would allow an employee to take the equivalent of $277,000 to the bank alone.

I cannot understand why Oscar nominee Anthony Perkins wasn't at least nominated for his role here. I guess I couldn't think of one nominee that I could replace that year. Burt Lancaster won the Oscar for Elmer Gantry. Perkins did win at Cannes the same year for Goodbye Again.

There were some other great actors in the film: Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Anderson, and John McIntire (""Wagon Train"").

Great direction, great cinematography and a great story.",9
13 November 2020,Psycho,"This film is considered a masterpiece. I cannot disagree with that. The monster is usually more frightening but in this case, it's less frightening. I highly recommend watching this classic.

1 June 2005,The Best Directed Film Ever,"I love Psycho so much I can't begin to describe what it means to me. The trouble is it has been over-sold in the last twenty years or so that it is known as the film with THAT scene in the shower. There's so much more to it than that. It is arguably the most influential film ever made, and the best directed one at that. Without it, there would be no Jaws, no Godfather, no Star Wars. Psycho may not be the greatest film ever made, nor the scariest film ever made, but is probably the best crafted thriller and a fine example of cinematic manipulation. Psycho continues to influence filmmakers. Look at the Psycho references in 2005's Houseof Wax (preservered mother, twin sons/ split personality, scary house on the hill.) Psycho is simply Great.

We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
28 December 2015,A true masterpiece !,"An absolute masterpiece, directed by Alfred Hitchcok, this is the best thriller-horror movie i've ever seen, you can watch it all over several times without become boring, even then you know secret of the film, it's always fascinating, Perkins fits in the character like 10/10, i don't even know why he didn't been nominated for an Oscar, somehow this film reminded me of ""The Silence of The Lambs"", in which Anthony Hopkins played this big role of ""Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter"", Norman Bates is a psychologically damaged guy, which supposedly lives ""alone"" in a old hotel, and lives in his mom's house, i loved that plot twist at the end, a true masterpiece.

20 August 2018,"""We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?""","A Phoenix secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), embezzles $40,000 and rashly flees town, ending up at a remote motel in Fairvale, California, where she encounters the eccentric Mama's boy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Mixed into this web is a private investigator (Martin Balsam), Marion's sister (Vera Miles) and Marion's secret beau (John Gavin).

Directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on Robert Bloch's book, ""Psycho"" made a huge impact when it was released in 1960. It contains a plot development that was groundbreaking at the time shared by England's ""City of the Dead"" (aka ""Horror Hotel""), which went into production six weeks earlier than ""Psycho"" and was released in the UK at the same time, but not in America until 2 years later. While they're both good, ""Psycho"" is way superior. It was followed by three sequels (1983, 1986 and 1990), the last being a semi-prequel, all starring Anthony Perkins as Norman with Vera Miles returning for the first one.

One thing I don't like is that it was shot in B&W. Check out the sequels and the 1998 remake to observe the same settings in living color.

The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes and was shot primarily at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California, with other parts in Los Angeles & Gorman, California, and Phoenix, Arizona.

6 May 2014,Culturally Significant and Excellent.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially.

13 October 2013,Norman Bates.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this smash hit, a terrifying film that begins with dissatisfied Phoenix office worker Marion Crane(played by Janet Leigh) who impulsively steals $40,000 from her employer, and drives to California to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis(played by John Gavin). On the way, she trades in her car, and stops at a remote motel on a rainy night run by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins) who is a friendly but strange young man dominated by his mother. Marion decides to return to Phoenix with the money, but a fateful shower will end her chance of redemption...Her sister Lila(played by Vera Miles) enlists the help of Sam and a detective named Arbogast(played by Martin Balsam) to investigate Marion's disappearance, but are in for a shock regarding Norman...

Brilliant horror film expertly manipulates audience expectations, and remains highly unpredictable and shocking. That iconic house is photographed quite menacingly at night(especially after the first murder) and the big reveal and final sequence is mesmerizing. Bernard Hermann's piercing and chilling score is unforgettable. My vote for Hitchcock's best film.",10
19 January 1999,How can anybody make such a good movie?,"How can a person think about such a wonderful movie, I can only say that you have to be a genius, which Hitchcock is... Psycho is his best movie but he has many others, The Birds, The Rope... He's just the best...

6 March 2017,Thieves check in but they don't check out,"Watching ""Psycho"" reminded me a lot of Spielberg's ""Duel"", and it's obvious where the homages lie. And even though we all probably know the spoilers before walking into this, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment. It's the buildup that matters, whether Janet Leigh's negotiating the open road with a guilty conscience or just stepping into the shower. I knew exactly what would happen, but I still couldn't look away. Hitchcock knows how to ratchet suspense; it's like seeing the master at work. Which is usually the case with his movies, it's just that this time, it's steeped in sin and voyeurism. We're all complicit, and that level of audience manipulation isn't sold in stores.

Great movie.

4 November 2007,"""We all go a little mad sometimes.""","""Psycho"" is undoubtedly among the tensest films ever created, if not the tensest. The film's story first introduces Marion Crane, but eventually leads to the Bates Motel, which acts as a vortex that sucks a host of characters in.

Anthony Perkins gives an unforgettable nuanced performance as Norman Bates, and develops the character expertly with stutters and expressions as well as dialogue. Janet Leigh is equal to giving a critical performance as the anxious Marion Crane, who carries the first part of the film. The performances of Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and the supporting cast are also solid.

Other than some brief pauses, this film consistently has heart-throbbing tension. Bernard Herrmann's famous score is an important contributing factor in the near constant tension. However, importantly this film also has an underlying mystery which ensures that the film is fascinating as well as tense.",10
9 April 2021,I can see why it was so groundbreaking!,"All I can say is that I could not keep my eyes off of this movie! Hitchcock pulled out all stops for his masterpiece. There was theft, lying, provocativeness with a female character, murder, and psychological trauma for everyone involved, both characters and viewers alike. What was most captivating about the whole film, however, would have to be Alfred Hitchcock's use of close up shots which showed the true fear and anxiousness within each character of the film.

11 May 2018,The master of suspense turns in one of his greatest efforts.,"Though a shift in focus at the half-way point slows the up-until-then taut pacing, this expertly directed feature is suspenseful and mysterious throughout. 'Psycho (1960)' is extremely unconventional, too. Its writing is simply fantastic. It feels as though the film it wanted to be is callously cut down at its mid-point, forcing it to follow a new and altogether darker path. An epilogue exposition sequence feels somewhat tacked-on, but it provides insight into a key character's psyche and arguably enhances what comes before it. There picture is full of great performances, including a masterful turn by Anthony Perkins, and Bernard Herrmann's score really is phenomenal. Hitchcock truly is the master of suspense and this is one of his greatest efforts. 9/10

7 April 2021,Week 11 IMDb Psycho,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with.

Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

3 May 2011,Psycho,"An untainted masterpiece, Hitchcock proves superbly that he had no impediments to conjure a classic B-movie like other lionized names like Roger Corman, George A. Romero and Russ Meyer etc., and all the more, he could outshine them by a notch.

The film is an authentic template of a first-rate thriller/horror opus, which I will not bother to outline the details (for instance the over-examined bathroom slaughter scene) inasmuch as there are a wealth of professional dissertations everywhere in the digital era. I simply admire the dexterity of the film in exuding its horror-arousing atmosphere. Hitchcock manufactures one of the most disturbingly creepy-cum-maniac killer in the history of cinema. The Oedipus complex patient Norman Bates is a lively product of the hermetic seclusion amid people and a emblem of the loss of morality, also the kill-after-the-epiphany scenario has never blemished its charisma even after 50 years.

The performance is uneven, in spite of the fact that the film earned the one-and-only BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS Oscar nomination for Janet Leigh (which sounds not equivalent to her monumental fame though), a leading-actress-goes-supporting set-up was an unanticipated stunt for its audience at that time, which is rarely seen presently. Anthony Perkins has such a multi-faced once-in-a-lifetime role and it would be an unforgivable sin if he had ruined it (two sequels PSYCHO II and III are perfectly justifiable spin-offs). Vera Miles, John Gavin plus other supporting roles, on the other hand, are the victims of Hitchcock's ""actor equals animal"" methodology, they are more like props than real flesh.

Arguably this is my favorite Hitchcock's film right now, I think only VERTIGO (1958) and NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) might have the chance to overthrow it from the throne. I know it is definitely my fault and I still don't figure out how could I miss this two.

P.S.: The top-notch status of the film intrigued a faithfully-copied remake by Gus Van Sant in 1998, whose ill-fated destination was preordained, which I am quite interested in as well after watching this original work.",9
4 December 2013,milestone,"a film who remind each fear, each frame of cold emotion. pure Hitchcock, like a precise puzzle or a chess game.a movie of details who put basis of a new perspective about genre, a work who is itself, profound different by novel or original story. impressive it is its force of fascination. and the thorough sides of each scene. it is not exactly a horror or the top of its director art. it is , maybe, cloth for the public dark universe. because, more important than music, acting, camera angle or the role of revolution in sensitivity rules, it is a milestone. for each viewer, the moment before and after Psycho is clear and unique. and a new meeting is not very different by the first. a classic ? maybe, only a legend.

14 December 2009,Psycho,"The 1960 suspense/horror film, ""Psycho"", is yet another Alfred Hitchcock classic. To say i wasn't completely caught up in it would be a lie. The storyline of this film can simply be described as incredible. With all the twists and turns throughout the whole movie, and as the suspense intensely grew, i just sat there in awe. Hitchcock is a master at what he does, and uses lighting and sounds to his advantage. Even though certain elements of his creations aren't very realistic, they seem to become more scary and memorable. The angles he uses are amazing and he has become one of my favorite directors. I give, ""Psycho"" 6 out of 6 chicken nuggets.

2 November 2009,"The Original and Best ""Wrong Turn"" Movie","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
25 June 2007,Surprise Movie From The Master,"Sir Alfred Hitchcock plays his audience like a fine instrument in this movie. He surprises at every turn. He layers some of the greatest suspense he ever put on film. This film will always have a place amongst the classic films.

Despite it's greatness, this is the most humble of films. When Hitchcock made this film, he actually did it on the cheap. He used the summer vacation from his TV series & used his regular TV crew to film this. The cast agreed to work for little money.

The genius in this movie is all Alfred Hitchcock. All he did was take an ordinary summer vacation, applied his genius to it, and produced an all time classic film. Hitch looked at this as a challenge. He wanted to prove it didn't take a bunch of money & a lot of studio smoke & mirrors to produce a great film. He succeeded beyond anyones wildest dreams.

Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins will never be forgotten for their parts in this masterpiece. Nor should they be, for their performances sparkle. Janet only had to work a portion of that summer. Perkins summer performance would last the rest of his life.

This is one of the first films to actually use a throne (toilet) in the film. Until Psycho, movies had never shown a toilet on screen & it is eerie how this throne comes on screen relating to the famous shower sequence. The 5 minute movie trailer with Alfred Hitchcock showing you around the Bates Motel set is a classic trailer for any film.

Regardless, it is Sir Alfred who really brought all this into a great film. No one else could have done it better. This film proves it doesn't take money to make a classic, just genius. We just don't find much of that around these days.",10

28 December 1998,"Cool movie, but old","Although the old movie may turn some people off due to the fact that it's in black and white, this actually an easy movie to follow.

Considered a classic by many, people who haven't seen it yet may be surprised when they see how the shower scene was shot (they may have pictured it differently in their mind).

Oh, by the way, if you haven't seen it yet, it's better to see the remake first THEN the orginal, instead of the original first, then the remake. That way, you will appreciate both films more.

P.S.- I have no idea why they had Anne Heche play Marion Crane on the remake instead of Pamela Anderson.

13 May 2015,Oh my grandmother,"The master of suspense delivers once more in this truly captivating film. Janet Leigh plays a woman who has left her job with a large sum of money belonging to the company. During her journey out of town she runs into a heavy down pour and decides that call it a night, taking refuge at the Bates motel. Things seem that only spire down hill from here as Lila begins to leave the picture we home in on Norman and slowly begin to realize he is far from a simple man taking care of a road side motel.

All of the acting, directing, and screen play in general are top notch, Hitchcock keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time because he refuses to give everything away all at once, making possibly every scene just as powerful as the last.

12 May 2015,An American Classic,"I remember when I first saw this the ending really got me by surprise. Now, looking back on it, I notice the smaller details Hitchcock put into this film. I, specifically, liked the comparison between the color of Janet Leigh's character's underwear. Int the beginning of the movie, her underwear was black. After she decided to give back the money h had stolen, her underwear is white to symbolize her repenting her crimes. Overall the movie is very good. My favorite part of the whole movie is Anthony Perkins' acting. It's excellently creepy which s good to set up an overall feel for the infamous Bates Motel. Another very good part is the movie's twist ending. One could argue that it's the predecessor for all future plot twists.

11 October 2008,the story is simple but the movie is very effective,"i think i had seen this ,movie,once,along time ago,or at least parts of it.but i had forgotten how good it is.naturally,the most talked about aspect of the movie is the infamous shower scene,so the suspense in waiting for that moment is something else.but the movie is great for other reasons.for one thing,the acting is superb,especially by Anthony Perkins,as Norman Bates.i also was struck by how good the dialogue is.the story is simple enough,yet very effective.this is widely considered Alfred Hitchcock's greatest achievement.Bernard Hermann's score is brilliant.the movie is done in black and wide,which i think makes it more effective than if it had been done in colour.all in all,an outstanding piece of work.for me,Psycho is a very strong 9/10

14 October 2013,Alfred Hitchcock's Magnum Opus,"Immortal for its contribution to cinema, notorious for pushing the boundary of what's accepted in mainstream movies & setting an extremely high benchmark for horror films to follow, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho remains the most influential, successful & famous work of his legendary career and is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest achievements in the history of filmmaking.

The story of Psycho concerns Marion Crane; a secretary working at a real estate office who is entrusted with $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank but ends up absconding with it in order to start a new life. Caught in heavy rain & tired after a long drive, she pulls over to spend the night at Bates Motel whose owner-manager seems to be very much under the dominion of his mother.

Throughout his career, director Alfred Hitchcock has enriched the world of cinema with some truly groundbreaking thrillers & despite that, Psycho feels like something of a first from him. It's his first stint with the genre of horror, it breaks through the barriers of censorship unlike any film before and over the years, it has played an major role in influencing not only films but pop- culture as well.

The screenplay is a gem in itself for the story is cleverly written by Joseph Stefano & also features many memorable quotes. Filmed on a modest budget, the black-n-white cinematography only ends up working in favour of the film as it makes excellent use of sharp focus, smooth tracking shots & meticulous detailing in capturing its events, while also providing an ageless look to the whole story.

Coming to the performances, the film features a reliable cast amongst which Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins end up impressing the most. While Leigh beautifully captures the guilty side of Marion, Perkins as Bates is show-stealing considering that he starts out pretty calmly but steadily levels it up as the story progresses & is absolutely chilling in the film's final moment.

Editing is also worthy of its praise for it paces the whole story ingeniously & gets its own moment to shine in what happens to be the film's most (in)famous sequence. Yet, the maximum contribution amongst all aspects comes from Bernard Herrmann's spectacularly terrifying score which makes its presence felt from the very beginning & ends up intensifying the film's overall cinematic experience by a great deal.

On an overall scale, with its tense atmosphere that looms over the plot from start to finish, outstanding direction, tight screenplay, superb performances, stunning grayscale photography, clever editing & relentless score, Psycho is a breathtaking work of perfection that marks the creative height of Alfred Hitchcock's glorious film career and not only is it the most influential example of its genre but is very much the sole reason why modern horror exists in the first place.",

We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions.

Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
5 October 2020,Genuinely Creepy,"What a movie.

Hitchcock at his best, producing a movie to be copied, cloned and revered.

I have taken a couple of points away from the ranking for ageing to relate the movie to a contemporary audience but don't let that mislead you.

This is a great film and Perkins is great in it, with such a boy next door persona.

10 July 2016,An immortal milestone,"This film revolves around a small roadside motel run by Norman Bates, a seemingly nice man who lives under the undisputed authority of his mother. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this film, considered by many his ""magnum opus"", has a screenplay by Joseph Stefano and a cast led by Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles.

I don't consider this film a horror movie, although its considered as such by most of people. It doesn't scare me, but let me uncomfortable, holding me to the screen. And I think that's what Hitchcock wanted to achieve. He was the master of suspense and knew how to hold the public, causing shivers of discomfort without putting the audience screaming in fear. The plot is brilliant, but the beginning doesn't show it, is intentionally unattractive in an effort to bring the public completely at ease... until Norman comes in. Norman Bates is one of the most psychologically complex characters I've ever seen, and was developed to the extreme by the director and the artist who gave him life. It looks like a nice guy, who even flirts with the attractive woman he just met.

The bathroom scene is perhaps one of the most famous in the film (I read somewhere that liquid chocolate was used to give the color that Hitchcock intended for the blood in the tub), and the incidental soundtrack used in that scene has become an icon for itself. But the end of the film is even better, with an absolutely staggering climax that makes all the audience feel that it was worth seeing the movie (even if you already know the whole story). The photograph, in black and white, makes a decisive contribution to increasing tension in the audience, and I am sure that this was a conscious and deliberate choice of Hitchcock to achieve that, showing again the great quality and talent of this director.

Nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Art Direction in Film Black and White, Best Cinematography in Black and White, Best Direction and Best Supporting Actress, this film didn't win any of them, which shows us that, sometimes, the Academy also makes mistakes. But ""Psycho"" doesn't need an Oscar to be a tremendous success. It is, and will remain, a milestone in film history, a cult film for Hitchcock lovers, for thriller lovers and for any lover of good movies. Movies like this one never dies, they are art... in its purest form.",10
8 April 2021,Psycho,"Psycho was a fast paced, and very well thought out movie. It had a variety of different shots and angles using weird points of view that would become stranger as the tension mounted. The tension was on and off, and every time it felt like it was about to break, they would switch to a calmer scene, and then switch back to the tense one. The constant change made the movie exciting to watch. Another thing I noticed were that almost every character felt like a REAL character. Most of the characters had lines or at least some interaction with the film. It kept pace until a smooth end with all the loose ends tied up. I though this movie really displayed Hitchcocks abilities both in suspense and in cinematography.

15 May 2010,Hitchcock's Psycho is shocking and thrilling!,"So I finally watched Psycho, what many consider the best horror film of all time. Does it deserve that title? Well, I love a lot of horror films, but I have to say is it very worthy of that title. I mean, it is good not try see classics with your mind set in stone that it will be one of the best ever, because it is over time that films develop fanbases and classic status, which I am sure this film was not nearly as acclaimed as when it first came out. The film is simple, but very effective. Hitchcock's direction is fantastic, and the writing brilliant. The performances from Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh are both fantastic and in their scenes together it is mesmerizing.

A lot of people cannot see this film without knowing about it's infamous scenes, most notably the shower scene. But honestly, I had heard something about a shower scene but when it happened it really shocked me and scared me. The music score is fantastic and probably the best horror score ever composed, and if not certainly in the Top 5. It enhances the uneasiness built by Hitchcock very effectively.

Overall, I was not disappointed by this film, and will definitely continue to pursue Hitchcock's filmography (this being my 2nd of his after The Birds, which was also almost equally as great but more underrated)",
20 April 2021,A timeless horror classic,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized.

13 May 2013,"One of the Most Thrilling Movies Ever Made,","Psycho is an absolutely fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline and a very talented cast.Alfred Hitchcock has not done a bad movie,and all of them are very thrilling,but this is certainly one of his best.The shower scene is one of the greatest movie sequences of all time hands down,and it is also so unexpected,we follow Janet Leigh for about the first thirty minutes of the movie,and she gets killed,you do not see it coming whatsoever,and you'd think that the movie would fall apart after killing off the main character,but it only gets better,and the twists only continue.Its an absolute classic and filled with mystery and thrills from start to finish,Psycho is a must see for all moviegoers.

A woman drives out to a motel to escape her boss after stealing $40,000 from him.But she chooses the wrong motel,where she meets the rather unusual owner.

Best Performance: Anthony Perkins",9
21 June 2022,Still perfectly unique,"One of the things that always impresses me when I rewatch this film is how marvelously unique it is--it looks, feels, and plays like a work of art into and of itself. It doesn't feel like a work of a director who admires other directors and fills their work with references or (depending upon your interpretation and how charitable you are) an homage to/rip-offs from past iconic work. This feels like a film that couldn't be made by anyone else, in any other way.

Of course, that's not true (probably, the shot-for-shot remake several years ago makes the case that it could be) but what PSYCHO offers -- and I'm intentionally avoiding spoilers, as requested in the original showings of the film, and for anyone from a new generation trying to decide whether to watch it -- is an experience that not only feels fresh for the time, but also feels like it hasn't been seen in quite that way since. Again, I come back to the word ""unque,"" as a mystery, yes, as a thriller, yes, but also as a film itself.

I also love how the (from today's vantage point) mild and merely suggested approach to violence and horror is as or more effective than the graphic stuff today.",9
27 November 2019,Why does the detective every time leave the car through the passenger door?,"When I first saw this movie, I didn't like it. I was bored, and I think I rated it six out of ten. But I was younger, with less film experience and much less patience. Therefore I decided to give it another chance.

Nominated for four Oscars, Alfred Hitchcock's horror thriller ""Psycho"" is considered one of the best films of all time and one of the most influential films in the genre. The oldest R-rated movie can also be found on the lists of the most controversial films because, in its time, it was something new and shocking. Frankly, I was a little bored. Although technically well-made, with great camera, music, and performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, the story and overall atmosphere made no special impression on me. The introductory part, until Marion arrives at the motel, was needlessly dragged on for half an hour and, after hundreds of watched thrillers and horrors, neither did the rest of it particularly hold my attention. With all due respect for the status of this film, its impact on the history of cinema, the cult scene in the shower and one of the most legendary twists of all time, my subjective impression does not allow me to rate it higher than

18 November 2015,Psycho,"Alfred Hitchcock has done it again. Psycho has set the bar for horror films and its still a great film to watch in this day and age. The ways Hitchcock uses the different camera angles to build suspense is incredible. The way director Hitchcock uses sound to unleash a chilling sense of fear to the audience is magnificent. Psycho is a must watch if your interested in watching a suspenseful horror film. Vera Miles as Lila Crane does a great job in this film and her character is outstanding. The ability to create suspense and thrill is an art and Alfred Hitchcock does just that and more. I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a classic horror film.

7 April 2016,A very scary movie.,"This is a classic. It is one of the scariest movie made before 1984. Psycho II is scarier. Psycho III is also scarier. But still this a very scary movie. It is one of the scariest movies from the 60's. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is so scary. It kind of mystery. So I do not say mush about the plot. I hate spoilers. I do not talk a lot about plots any way. It is such a good movie that 8.5 is underrating. If you not get scared then no movie will scary you. This is one of the best horror movie from the 60's. This movie is a most see. It is a true horror classic. It is very scary.

17 December 2017,Hitchcock's greatest work,"Since joining IMDB this is the first film that I have awarded a score of 10/10. Masterpiece that just improves with each viewing, however the two killing scenes lose their jump factor when you know they are about to happen. First time I watched this though I jumped out of my skin. Brilliantly directed and acted, great sets, one of the scariest/most effective musical scores in cinematic history and simply way ahead for it's time Grandfather of the slasher movie? Maybe, but, with a few odd exceptions (eg Carpenter's ""Halloween""), this is so so much better.

19 January 2022,"""Psycho""","""Psycho"" remains an amazing movie even after all these years. It's a must-see in 4K, and it's now the preferred version to watch. I've watched this movie many times over the past 30 years, so my love for it never wanes. I look forward to watching it again in a few years, and it deserves a rating of 5. 30/10/2020 Alfred Hitchcock was a master of cinema, and ""Psycho"" is a testament to his genius. The film is unpredictable and shows a wide range of problems for the viewer. The narrative is shaky, and it is incredibly interesting to watch. Hitchcock has other great films, but ""Psycho"" is the way a thriller/horror movie should be made. It adheres to a certain visual style, and its tone is uncomfortable. ""Psycho"" ranks among the greatest films ever made. If there's one movie you should see, it's this one.

John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
21 May 2009,The horror and the terror combining on a broad canvas of genre manipulation; psychoanalysis and deconstruction of an archetype in what most say is Hitchcock's best.,"Similarly to a lot of films from decades-past, nothing anybody here, or anywhere else, says about certain films will alter their status as ground breaking, or influential in certain aspects, pieces of cinema. Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is one of those such films, a film that put paid to an entire era and mindset in American cinema; a film that defied grammar and construction and went all out in its deconstruction of both genre and issues of censorship. A film made by a man usually uttered within the same breath as both Kubrick and Welles when it comes to the film-makers that shaped cinema in its first full century as an existing medium. Most will say Psycho is Hitchcock at his best, and you'd be hard pressed to disagree with them.

Essentially, Psycho is a film that covers a fair degree of psychoanalysis going on within a close knit locale. The majority of the film is dominated by a certain Norman Bates (Perkins), a young man whose mother still has a grip on him as he attempts to live whatever pitiful existence he has. Bates will predominantly inhabit one of either two spaces, briefly breaking off to inhabit a rural, swamp locale for the dumping of a car. The predominant two are a cabin, complete with motel rooms and an office as well as his house on the hill which he 'shares' with his mother. Something that Hitchcock does to a very basic level with these seemingly innocent, everyday locations is turn them into spaces of the 'uncanny' variety. That is to say, at a time when Hollywood's studio system permitted definitive genres to be shot on certain sets well suited to the genre film being made, (a mad scientist's laboratory for horror or the inside of a space ship for a sci-fi) Hitchcock manipulates offices and houses and other such 'spaces' and turns them on their heads for what the locations initially demand you produce there.

But the toying with the genre isn't limited to just this. The set up involves a certain Marion Crane (Leigh) and the theft of a large amount of money from her boss. What is set up as a road movie, in which we might assume chase to be the primary narrative drive, turns into something completely different. Initially, the film is driven by a woman. Marion is presented in a less than flattering light, established at the very beginning when it appears she has spent the entirety of her lunch break with another man out of wedlock. Following this is the theft and the complete disregard for authority and her own safety when it transpires she sleeps in her car and very quickly tries to get rid of a police officer when he questions her.

For this passage of film, Psycho relies on its suspense revolving around whether Marion will be caught as would-be lines of dialogue are exchanged within Marion's mind to do with what her peers are debating back at her work. What we assume will be a (routine?) chase film-come-thriller as her boss strives to get his money back will become something else entirely, aptly marked at a certain point in the film in which special attention is given to the removing of the money from the piece. Following this, a new plot drive, indeed protagonist, takes over the reigns of the film and it branches out into a different beast.

I suppose we are meant to consider Psycho a horror piece, despite it starting off as a thriller told from the guilty's perspective as essence of chase looms in the background. Later on, following the famous shower scene, tides will turn and what essentially remains a detective story is told from a killer's perspective. The film places the audience within the world of a murderer and we begin to see that world through the eyes of this character, something that occurs perhaps slightly out of turn when Norman spies on Marion getting undressed in her motel room by the office. It is a signifying of power; a placing the audience into a position of power that they are forced to share with Norman, whom, at the time, probably just comes across as a little eccentric. Later on, however, the audience are completely roped in and must share the stress with Norman. A clever move on Hitchcock's behalf is in the form of private detective Milton Arbogast (Balsam), who badgers poor Norman at the motel reception about recent visitors. Norman squirms and, as an audience, we may have an immediate reaction of not wanting Norman to get caught out. But should we be feeling these emotions given who he is and what he did?

If Psycho achieves anything, it is the manipulation of genre and film language, but it is additionally the breaking down of a character archetype. For the film to spend time with Norman, a seemingly normal human being, as this 'monster' inhabiting a horror film, is extraordinary. There is nothing initially uncanny about Norman and he is a far cry from previous horror genre 'monsters' in the form of anything Universal had to offer at the time. But the film retains a spooky and unnerving atmosphere, punctuated by set pieces involving the aforementioned Arbogast, in a memorable scene on some stairs; but also right towards the end when normal, everyday individuals move in on Bates' house to uncover the truth, in what is a sequence that is still rather frightening. Psycho is somewhat of a towering achievement, and the fact an individual produced this sort of a film yet still managed to cause debate as to whether it's his out-and-out best work, is arguably the most incredible thing about the Psycho.",8
25 March 2022,Hitchcock really went there,"Just recently saw the slightly extended version that was in theaters in the 60's and wow... it's definitely still tame when you compare it to horror films from today but you can easily see how this was pushing the boundaries for films of that time.

But worst of all is how familiar he feels, like one of those people we know IRL who are just slightlyoff. And the filmwhat can I say? The score is brilliant, the script is incredible in every way, the camera floats and sits so beautifully. It's just a skin-crawling good time from top-to-bottom.

22 August 2021,Pedestrian thriller....,"OK, I get it. Psycho was filmed ages ago, and we have to watch it with with a mindset of someone who lived in the 1960's.

But, the story is so pedestrian, there is no suspense, no horror, nothing... To be honest, Psycho is a pretty boring film. Compared too Psycho, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is gold, because at least it is fun/funny (intentionally or not!)

And what about the shower scene? What is so scary about it?

Hammer horror films from the same era were scarier and much better than Psycho.

The whole experience was very disappointing. Another example of the Emperor's new clothes.

15 March 2012,Classic horror,"A secretary steals $40,000 from her employer and during her escape she stops at the Bates Motel to hide out; big mistake as the proprietor is the one and only Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), a real oddball who tells the girl, Marion(Janet Leigh) that he gets very few customers and that he lives with mother who lives upstairs. He invites her to dinner and she overhears him arguing with her over the proposed date. Mom is the ultimate control freak and she warn him about the evil ways of women. What follows may be the most famous shower scene in the history of cinema, so there is no need to describe it here, as no one since as been able to improve on Alfred Hitchcock's subtle way of making the viewer actually use their own imagination. A standard detective drama follows with Marion's sister Lila(Vera Miles) pairing up with private eye Milton Arbogast(Martin Balsam) to find her missing sibling. Norman turns out to be a severely disturbed individual with an extremely strange secret. If you haven't yet seen the 1960 version of Psycho, see it and marvel at the work of a master director.

6 March 2021,Hogwash.,"I can't believe this movie is regarded as some brilliant cinema classic. It was going great until the last fifteen minutes, in which it became absolutely ridiculous. It went from being hilarious and intriguing to downright fatuous. The murder scenes are completely cheesy and laughable. Her eye moved twice when she was dead. The monologue the psychiatrist gave at the end was embarrassing. I can see how in 1960 this would have been groundbreaking and shocking, however it does not stand the test of time. I give it a three for good acting.

27 February 2018,"Psycho not only shocked audiences, it defined the thriller genre.","I don't think there has ever been a film more referenced than Psycho. The musical score, the shower scene, the memorable characters...heck, it's even spawned a TV series. Essentially a young woman is responsible for cashing in $40,000 to her work's bank, but instead goes on the run. She stops by the Bates Motel for a rest, little did she know it would be her eternal resting place. An investigation arises into Norman Bates where certain ominous discoveries are made. This was completely unconventional back in 1960. To kill off the lead protagonist halfway through the film was bold. I'm talking massive kahunas. It was groundbreaking. Hitchcock had the audience right on his fingertips, like a puppeteer. His directing style was better than perfect. I've never seen such inventive camera techniques that clearly has influenced filmmakers today. The shower scene switching back and forth between the knife and Janet Leigh screaming, only to then watch the blood drain from the pristine bathtub. The slow panning as Vera Miles searches Bates' house, how every room concealed many secrets. Then the climax. The big reveal. Simply unforgettable. Hitchcock's natural talent of creating suspense and tension has yet to be exceeded. All performances were classy and felt natural. Leigh and Miles exhumed elegance. Balsam plays the private investigator with complete control. But Anthony Perkins...wow. His ability to switch from creepy psychopath to normal human was masterful. I couldn't take my offs of the screen. Finally that musical score evokes nightmares. Sharp, high pitched notes to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film's entirety. Some of the thrills were inconsistent and the build up to these crescendos take slightly too long, but the characters are developed enough to prevent the build up from being boring. However, Psycho is an extremely well controlled thriller that not only defined the genre, but paved the way for the future of cinema. A must-see for any film buff.",9

6 September 2001,Very Deserved of Such High Praise,"The story of the motel owner with a split personality is part of our American culture. Everyone is familiar with the famous shower scene. Bernard Herrmann's score evokes memories and moods instantly. Psycho is a film masterpiece. It is a wonderfully chilly tale of sexual repression, of madness, of the effects that living alone can have on an individual, and finally on the rural aspects of horror in the life of rural America. It is a cheaply made film, but accomplishes so much with so little. The credit goes to a handful of people. First and foremost in this group stands the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock. It is Hitchcock's best film in terms of utilizing the minimal for the most shocking scenes ever filmed. His shower scene is forever etched into the mindset of people all over the world. When the film came out, people were afraid to take showers afterward for quite awhile. The camera lens sets the pace for the film, and my favourite scene is Janet Leigh driving in the car. Extremely well-shot scenes with a steady current of tension. Hitchcock was ably assisted by all concerned. Herrmann's score is awesome. Joseph Stefano did a wonderful job adapting the wonderful novel by horror legend Robert Bloch. The acting is first-rate. Anthony Perkins did such a good job that he never could escape the role of Norman Bates. Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, even John Gavin do credible jobs. Janet Leigh is very good, and looks quite fetching and provocative in a black brassiere. Watch for cameos by Simon Oakland(from The Night Stalker fame) and Ted Knight as a guard. An incredible film in many ways - not least of which is the incredible legacy the film has acheived in our cultural panorama.",10
4 May 2014,favorite Hitchcock film,"Having just finished the first season of Bates Motel on Netflix, I was very excited to watch Psycho, to see what the show was based off of. And I have to say, it did not disappoint. The film is full of plot twists, with an ending that one does not expect. It is also filled with many Hitchcock like shots, being very dramatic and suspenseful. The score of the film adds to the over all horror and suspense feel that the audience gets while watching, and helps make the film the masterpiece that it is. Psycho has definitely been a reference for many horror films to follow, and will continue to do so. It is truly a masterpiece, and I would recommend it to anyone.

21 March 2019,it's good apart from the middle.,"What people don't tell you about this movie is how much it sags in the middle.

I don't want to spoil anything but I think you can guess what happens early on that might do that.

I was very intrigued as this movie started. I was curious to see what became of these characters. Then we meet Norman Bates and he is exactly what we want to see in these kinds of movies. He conveys an unintentionally disquieting character. You really feel like you are dealing with a damaged character but one who doesn't wear it on their sleeve like other characters would.

There's the iconic scene which is stunning of course but then it drags because there's nothing to do except follow police procedure. That is the laziest kind of story: just follow people whose job it is to investigate macabre things...

But it does pull itself together by the end. The ending will really stay with you. It's just thoughtful.",5
29 March 2013,"""Mother Knows Best!""","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects.

16 June 2009,The mother of all horror films,"Going into the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece ""Psycho,"" it's best that you know nothing -- in fact Hitchcock wanted it that way -- so this review will be devoid of any synopsis beyond that of the basic plot summaries given on IMDb. But truth is, the plot is only half the film's genius. The rest belongs to the master of murder and suspense.

""Psycho"" thrives on suspense. Without the constant feeling of paranoia from Hitchcock's careful camera movements or from Bernard Herrmann's vigorous string quartet, many parts of the film would feel long. At this point in his career, Hitchcock was so commanding of his craft that he achieves the desired effect from his audience with nearly every shot, whether it's wanting us to focus on particular items or make specific assumptions about the mystery at hand.

Perhaps the most understated element of the film is Joseph Stefano's screenplay. From what I gather about Robert Bloch's novel, Stefano restructured the story to set up a jarring shift in the plot and encase the mystery in an even thicker container for Hitchcock to best utilize his skills. The scripts only major weakness is the scene right after the climax, which is pointless exposition explaining the previous events; something movie watchers don't need today -- though that's arguably because Hitchcock made this movie.

For those that love Hitchcock's style, ""Psycho"" is an instant classic and perhaps no film of his showcases it better. For those unfamiliar with his work, it's not hard to see while watching ""Psycho"" what made his films so memorable. Even those who don't have an eye for good film-making can even appreciate the entertaining suspense and constantly twisting plot of ""Psycho.""",9

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
29 January 2008,Amazingly scary and beautifully done masterpiece!,"I was first introduced to Psycho when I was parts of it on TV, I was about 6 when the shower scene came on, I closed my eyes, and stayed there, hugging my father, tapping my years, it was truly scary. But what actually scared me, wasn't the fact that the killer murders someone in the bath, but the music. The screaming violin tune is one of the, if not, the most famous tune ever, which was copied to other films such as ""Carrie"" and ""The Amityville Horror"".

Anthony Perkins does a great job of the motel owner - Norman Bates. He seems sympathetic, a nice young man, but being tormented by his sick mother, who always stands seating there, staring from the bedroom window of the ""Psycho house"" is also a great shot.

Janet Leigh is great in this movie too, when she's running away from the police, you really can feel her fear, and it seems as she's also driving to madness!

This great Hitchcock film, while, in the future, many other horror films will be forgotten, will stand up, and will remain known as one of the greatest films ever made!",10

17 December 2020,"""Psicosis"" (1960)","""Psycho"" (1960) the great masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock, with the interpretation of Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, John Gavin, Vera Miles, inspired by the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch (1959).

The film puts you in tension from the beginning with its claustrophobic music the role Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates) plays is incredible.

As a young man, he kills his mother by poisoning her, only to have her mummified in the basement or in the bedroom, believing everyone that her mother is still alive. Norman works in the motel as if nothing happened, killing his clients and disguising himself as his mother, the most mythical scene of the movie when the actress (Janet Leigh) Marion Crane, is in the shower and sees Norman arrive with his knife, and the background music makes your hair stand on end, shocking when the camera focuses on the blood that falls in the shower.

The film was shot in the universal studios, was nominated for 4 Oscars: best actress, best director, best black and white film, best art direction-set or decoration.

It won none, in the Golden Globes Janet Leigh managed to win it.",8
24 October 2011,The Persona of Horror Films,"It wasn't a message about psychological abuse or the dark side of the maternal instinct that enthused the audiences, nor was it any particular performance. They were stimulated by sheer, out-and-out cinema. Hitchcock consciously shot Psycho not with his high-priced feature regulars but with his TV crew. Lengthy segments hold no dialogue. In its gut sensation, Psycho fits better alongside shoestring noir like Detour than with Hitchcock's own chic Technicolor thrillers like Rear Window or Vertigo. In this way and in its starring use of Janet Leigh, Psycho is as much a companion piece with Touch of Evil as it is Hitchcock's arguably most socially pivotal film.

But no other Hitchcock film had more effect. He's directing us. It was the most staggering film 1960 moviegoers had ever experienced. You couldn't be today's pervasive moviegoer: Walking in late, you'd be waiting to see the star after she's disappeared from the action. Plus, the internet would've shattered any possibility of preserving the movie's genuine shocks, none of which one could've anticipated Hitchcock had in store without it. Modern moviegoers would've ruined this film for themselves before even walking in. He didn't just direct movies. He directed us. He directed several subsequent decades of movie plot expectations.

Of course, today's generation can still see it as a fearsome, ingenious thriller despite knowing all about the shower scene that would've been like the revelation of Luke Skywalker's father in 1960 terms rather than 1980 ones. It's all owing to Hitchcock's imagination in two matters not as obvious: The pure subjective telling of Marion Crane's story, and her rapport with her new host. Hitchcock's trick is dedicating his thorough concentration and flair to handling them like they'll be expanded upon for the whole remaining film.

Anthony Perkins is uncanny in establishing the thorny character of Norman, in a performance that has become momentous. He lets us know there's something deeply amiss with Norman, and yet he has a young man's congeniality, stuffing his hands into his pockets, hopping onto the porch, beaming a toothy greeting. Only when discussion becomes personal does he begin to hesitate and sidestep. He evokes our empathy right alongside Marion's.

Nearly every present-day viewer is spending that whole time anticipating the spectacle of murder in store. However, seeing the shower scene today, various elements are notable. Unlike contemporary horror films, Psycho never sees the knife actually striking flesh. We see no wounds. Herrmann's slicing strings deputize for more gruesome sounds. And yet this remains the most famously shocking of cinema's slasher deaths, suggesting that graphic details are more shocking in our mind's eye and ear depending on their circumstances and creativity.

The terror of the rug being yanked swiftly and completely from beneath us is followed by Norman's painstaking erasure of the whole staggering affair. Hitchcock is subtly swapping protagonists. The new one killed the old one, yes, but we relate to Norman because, if we killed somebody, we'd be devoured by paranoia and remorse, just like him. The car sinks, then lingers. Norman watches fixedly, until it's ultimately submerged beneath the swamp.

Checking one's feelings, it dawns that we want that car to sink, which is what Norman wants. This is one of the most daring exchanges in Hitchcock's sustained custom of stage-managing the audience itself. Psycho's legend and luster will never die because, when innumerable films are over and done as the credits roll, it ties as candidly with our apprehensions as movie-making form can: That any one of us may impetuously commit a crime, our dread and paranoia of the police, our nightmares of becoming the quarry of a madman, and naturally, of failing our mothers.",10

4 November 2020,Having me at the edge of my seat to the end,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

13 November 2020,We all go a little mad sometimes......,"As I begin writing this review I can't help but feel a subtle chill run down my back, this is a testament to Alfred Hitchcock's successful execution of such an unsettling story. Viewed by many as one of the greatest films ever made, there's no doubt in my mind as to why Psycho has such a legendary reputation. Released in 1960, Psycho opened the door for many films in the thriller/slasher/horror genre that would follow. Psycho indices you from beginning to end. Each scene has your heart racing increasingly faster as the film progresses and for a different reason each time. This film draws you in to one situations and then turns you around right into another before you can even realize. Hitchcock masterfully pieces this unique story together. I felt Psycho came across as a very complete movie, captivating performances, appealing cinematography, an unsettling score, and just the ability to draw you in is all pretty remarkable. The score alone is enough to make to shutter a little and it is paired up with every scene perfectly. The shots Hitchcock provides have a way of putting the films situation into perspective for the audience. It makes you feel part of the story and takes you on an intensified journey of angst and curiosity. Psycho's performances were convincing all around, but the real gem of this cast is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins performance is the backbone of Psycho, Norman Bates is a genuinely chilling character with a lot more too him than just simply being strange. The concept of Norman Bates and his mother adds to this films uniqueness and disturbing feel. 100% recommend, especially to horror/thriller fans who have been holding out.",9

His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
9 October 2004,Alfred Hitchcock Classics: Psycho.,"Psycho (1960) is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. The movie is loosely based upon the novel by Robert Bloch and it was adapted by Joseph Stefano. Psycho made stars out of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (sadly it also sent the two to typecasting hell in the process). Hitchcock proved that he could adapt to the changing styles of Hollywood and make a true horror classic. He wisely shot the movie in black and white (giving the film an even creepier aura)and used a lot of great camera angles and trick photography. Anthony Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, a young man who's life has been ruined by his overbearing mother. Janet Leigh is perfect as the young woman with the shady past trying to find a new life.

Psycho was not only the pinnacle in Alfred Hitchcock's film career as a director but it also changed the face of horror. Just when film makers such as himself where being phased out by Hollywood, Mr. Hitchcock redefined not only as a director but in the process changed the face of horror forever.

The success of this movie spawned three direct sequels, a pilot for a t.v. series (Bates Motel) and a badly made remake (Although I have to say the cinematography was beautiful). It has also been parodied to death and referenced in many horror films and comedies. Psycho has not only achieved worldwide fame but it's also a part of Americana as well. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it already. Truly a one of a kind film.

Highest recommendation possible.",9

9 December 2015,This is beginning to look more like what Horror should look like,"I'm not putting a spoiler because I'm talking about the shower scene, and if you don't know that scene, I'm sorry but you must not know anything. THIS is why I was so hard on Frankenstein! This is what horror should look like! It actually gets to you! We still have a ways to go, but this is definitely an improvement. That shower scene? After watching it, I realized just how easy it would be to kill someone in the shower. You're virtually deaf to everything going on outside of the shower! I realized that before, but now, my imagination can run wild with the idea of someone trying to break into my house and kill me in the shower! This is what horror and psychological thrillers are supposed to do! Mess with your head! Oh, and the camera-work and lighting were awesome too! There were some moments that were kinda unrealistic, but that's part of Hitchcock's thing. So, all in all, I really liked this movie.

4 March 2014,The Perfect Horror Film,"Psycho is a ""less is more"" type of film. The minimal budget allotted to Hitchcock made him simpler and more restrained in his film-making. This allowed the story and acting to shine through instead of the big names and huge flair of earlier films like North by Northwest. Janet Leigh is stunning as Marion Crane and ensures that we remember what little screen time she has. The rest of the supporting cast is memorable to a point and adds emotional depth to the story; however, it is Anthony Perkins who steals the show. His performance as Norman Bates is one of the most stunning performances of all time. Perkins also hides the film's twist well throughout the entire movie, adding to Psycho's suspense. The score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and adds incredibly to the suspense, especially during the infamous shower scene. That single scene is perhaps the defining scene of Hitchcock's career. It not only serves as the single catalyst for the plot, it also shows the attention to detail he gave to his movies. Psycho is the best horror film ever made for its reliability on every other factor besides gore to create suspense. It revolutionized the genre, along with Hitchcock's career, to be more focused on substance rather than style.",10

22 February 2016,Great movie...,"A classic movie will always be a classic movie and in this case with the movie psycho it is a classic and always will be. The plot the action and all the expense that was put into this movie at such an early time when movies were just taking shape and form this was an amazing movie to produce. This movie shows many traits that people feel show or portray themselves to be now a days in the way some people carry their lives with or without a disability. This movie shows hatred greed envy acceptance lying cheating and stealing all in one movie it is an amazing classic that I have seen before and I am glad that I got to see it again and relive the excitement of the Bates Motel and psycho..

20 January 2013,Fantastic,"I have not seen this movie in full for very long time,

I would of thought that movie would feel a bit dated now , t didn't at all,

I never thought of it before but this movie felt like it's was way before it time.

The movie flowed really well there was slow parts in the movie, which were not boring at all and there was great atmosphere in this movie.

Some scenes in this movie were very creepy at times and the acting playing Norma bates was outstanding playing Creepy Psycho.

This movie had a very good twist in the movie that may shock people if they already didn't know about it.

Who can forget about that famous shower scene, which still kinda of work after all these years and I thought the whole movie was really great.

The only bad thing that I can say about this movie is that one scene did look little out dated then the other parts of the movie , I am talking about the Stairs death dose look little silly today.

Also The acting in this movie was great from the whole cast and Alfred Hitchcock did an outstanding job on this movie. 9 out of 10",9
3 March 2023,The most twisted film I've ever seen,"This film is so twisted! The twists in the movie are shocking and make no sense at first but towards the end of the film, they make it make sense. It's a great film and you really don't know what will happen next, I don't know how this film didn't get nominated for best picture but if you're willing to watch at least one horror movie, please consider this one if you haven't already, you will not regret your decision, trust me! There are so many classic scenes and lines as well like the shower scene for example (if you know what I'm talking about) or bates motel. This is definitely Alfred Hitchcock's best film of all time and might even be the best horror film as well.

26 July 2020,A completely succeeded experiment by Hitchcock,"In these days ""Psycho"" is the topfilm of Alfred Hitchcock. In IMDB this is his number 1 film in number of votes as well as in rates (26-07-2020).

This has not always been the case. When he made the film ""Psycho"" was an experiment for Hitchcock. It was his switch from thriller to horror (the famous shower scene). Respected Hitchcock actors had a certain amount of reserve to become associated with this ""experiment"", and so the cast of ""Psycho"" contains lesser known and upcoming actors. For Anthony Perkins (playing Norman Bates) this chance was a ""curse in disguise"". He got never rid of his Norman Bates image.

Apart from the cheaper actors the budget for ""Psycho"" was also in other respects more limited then previous Hitchcock movies. This was a deliberate choice. Hitchcock wanted the film to have an unpolished look.

As usual Hitchcock has an unusual way to tell the story. The film begins with a theft of apparent main charachter Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). This theft is the reason Marion has to flee, but plays no role in the rest of the story. At around 1/3 of the film Marion is killed and the film has to find another main character.

The experiment with Psycho succeeded completely and, as said in the beginning of this review, today ""Psycho"" is the top film of Hitchcock. In 1998 director Gus van Sant made an exact remake, image for image. At Universal studio's you can visit the set of ""Psycho"", which has become a tourist attraction.",8
2 December 2016,an absolute classic,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
1 June 2006,"Hitchock's Most Famous Film, And Probably His Best.","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue"").

23 July 2012,The master of all suspense thrillers,"¨I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.¨ Psycho is the master of all suspense thrillers and I will include it in my list of masterpieces. It was way ahead of its time and continues to impress today. This is where the term Hitchcockian came from to describe these psychological horror films that have been inspired by the great Hitchcock. It's been over 50 years since Hitchcock directed this film, and horror directors are still trying to imitate what he did. One of the things I enjoyed the most about this film is the way that Hitch fooled us all into thinking that it was going to be about Janet Leigh's character and ended up killing her off in the first half of the movie. I hadn't seen this film before, but had seen the famous shower scene thousands of times before. It's amongst the greatest scenes in film history considering the way Hitch filmed every shot taking the audience by surprise. I always thought that scene was the final one, so I was surprised to see it only 40 minutes into the movie. From that moment on I was sold and on board with what other unexpected turn the movie was going to make. Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates was the highlight of the movie for me. He was excellent in his role and I was surprised he didn't get much credit for it. I think he was much better than the rest of the cast. I also imagine what a surprise the ending must have been for most people during the time since it was something totally unprecedented. I did see it coming now of course since so many films have copied the format, but I can only imagine the initial reaction. Psycho was also the perfect title for the film.

As for the story goes it deals with an office worker from a small town in Arizona named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is in her early 30's and single. She has to meet with her love interest, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in secret during lunch hours in a motel because he is from out of town and buried in debts due to alimony payments. When she arrives at work from her break she stumbles upon 40,000 dollars that her boss hands over to her to deposit in the bank. During a moment of irrationality she decides to keep the money and begin a new life in some other town. She takes off as soon as she can and begins driving away from the city as fast as possible. Tired after the long drive, Marion ends up staying at a motel off the highway for the night. The motel is run by a friendly young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who tells Marion that they don't get many visitors nowadays. He offers her something to eat before she goes to bed, and she accepts. She later hears Norman discussing with his mother about his invitation and discovers that he is dominated by her. Her strong influence over him worries Marion, but she is tired and just once to rest before continuing her trip. Norman may not be the friendly young man who he seems to be after we see him watch her from a peeping hole. What follows is the famous shower scene and then the story continues with several twists and surprises.

I've heard many complaints about the final scene of this great film which was adapted by Joseph Stefano, from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name. I can understand how this scene may seem out of place, especially now because the audience is expected to piece everything on their own, but I consider it necessary for the time because audiences weren't familiar with the psychotic term or connotation. Of course the explanation seems out of place today because we all understand what has happened, but in the 60's this film was way ahead of its time and had no precedents so it was necessary to spell everything out to the audience. I may be wrong, but I still don't have a problem with that scene although I do admit it is one of the only scenes in the film that hasn't aged well. Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors and I wish more directors would make psychological thrillers as well as he did. Psycho is probably one of his most recognized works, but I still think his best movie all time is Rear Window. If you haven't seen these movies by all means go watch them because they are timeless.

4 August 2014,Hasn't aged that well,"I do realize how ground-breaking this film was. I was born a year before the premiere, and it was still widely talked about ten to twelve years later. Janet Liegh was yet another of Alfred Hitchcock's cold blondes. And it is hard to do a better tormented crazy than Anthony Perkins. But I am not at all sure that this film has aged well. Some of Hitchcock's iconic visual images, such as the camera looking into the shower head, and the camera following the detectives face in tight as he is falling down the stairs, are still being copied today. But there is so much ""arty"" direction today that it badly distracts from the films. And that sort of blows back on Psycho. Still a classic nonetheless.

30 January 2009,Scary and strange classic Hitchcock movie...,"1st watched 1/27/2009 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): Scary and strange classic Hitchcock movie provides plenty of reasons to watch and enjoy. Janet Lee plays a woman who decides to steal a large sum of cash and escape with it. The problem is she stops off to stay at the Bates Hotel overnight(which was definitely a mistake) and runs into the Bates family -- or at least it appears this way. Anthony Perkins is excellent as the disturbed son of the messed up family who covers up for his supposed mother's mistakes in the true good son fashion. The mystery behind the movie is determining who did the evils to Janet and others in the Bates Hotel. Hitchcock brilliantly keeps us guessing til the end as well as providing the shocks that we expect from the movie. This is the ultimate weird family scary movie that others have tried to imitate(some well and some badly), but they never match the excellent direction done by the master storyteller. There is the much imitated shower scene, but the overall movie in general is well written and put together and the one scene shouldn't make the entire movie(which it doesn't here). Viva La Hitchcock!! You have done it again!!",7

7 July 2019,WOW,"This movie is almost 60 years old and its still better than most horror movies out there now! I watched this movie for the first time today with a lot of anticipation. I have always seen it appear in lists of top horror movies, top movies from the 1960s, top thriller movies etc. and i have wanted to watch it for the longest time. The acting is phenomenal (bar a couple of minor characters) and the storyline is excellent. Due to the movie being created in the 1960s, CGI was not used, meaning they had to rely on practical effects. Although not very explicit and violent, the practical effects are done well, and the viewer is allowed to imagine the rest. Psycho has done a great job of leaving me feeling unsettled and intrigued at the same time. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the dialogue is so natural and brilliant. It is so cleverly written with a couple of twists and turns at the end, which leaves you feeling so satisfied. My heart was just racing the whole time i was watching! 10 out of 10 because not many films leave me with a smile on my face after watching it :-)

2 April 2013,OG horror,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a god tier horror movie and I'd say its probably the best example of classic horror. The story has at this point been told and remixed 1000 different ways over the years but because of Alfred's understanding of human fear and his incredible skill as a director no other film maker can come close to creating as captivating of a psychopath as the infamous Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). I love the symbolism in the very last scene where Norman sits alone in the chair and claims he'd never hurt a fly. Very clever and unorthodox camera angles keep the viewer on the edge of their seat while watching this film especially during the scenes where Norman attacks his victims and the famous shrieking sound effect begins to play. If you have never seen this movie and enjoy horror movies it is definitely worth watching. Even though compared to current film it may seem dated because of the lack of special effects and computer animation the rawness and great use of music and sound effects by Hitchcock make this slasher flick stand the test of time.

6 August 2020,"Creepy, suspenseful, unpredictable.","This film was very unique. It's very unpredictable and does not follow any paths. It invented some of the cheap psychological horror techniques like quick editing and loud sounds, but that's why it's good, because it was so fresh. Even by todays standarts this film still has a great punch.

29 May 2019,This Movie Changed the Way I Viewed Cinema,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12 years old and it sparked the passion i have today about movies and TV. Alfred Hitchcock's directing is at its best in this film. I only need to mention the shower scene and the final shot of the movie to prove my point. Psycho sets a creepy and often unsettling atmosphere throughout the movie and Alfred Hitchcock shows the audience that he is in full control of his craft. Psycho can feel slow at times but it is definitely worth it and just adds to the tension of the film. Anthony Perkins gives the performance of his career as the now legendary character of Norman Bates as well as Janet Leigh as Marion Crane. Psycho even though it was made in 1960 can still make the audience feel uneasy even today and is truly a staple of the horror genre.

23 July 1999,The Best All-Time Horror Film,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is really the best horror movie ever made. Its excellence results from the dominant element of suspense in place of gory monotony. Since next year is the 40th Anniversary of the black-and-white version, I do hope that the prints will be spruced up for a theatrical rerun. I would certainly see it on the silver screen, perhaps along with countless other ""PSYCHO"" fans across the WORLD. Since this version presents a more complete account of this classic storyline, it is actually better than ""PSYCHO-1998"". The 1960 ""Psycho"" continues to reign supreme.

25 August 1999,....ultimate Hitchcockian masterpiece....,"This ultimate Hitchcockian masterpiece is an artful, suspenseful, beautiful, and horrifying thriller! So many taboos of the era were abolished by this film - violence, brief nudity, transvestism, and (gasp!) a flushing toilet. While all of this has lost its shock value by today's standards, the overall grasp this film has on the viewer will never be outdated. Considered by many to be Alfred Hitchcock's greatest work, this is undoubtedly one of the highlights of film history.

The story begins in Phoenix, Arizona, with a woman named Marian Crane (Janet Leigh) and her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in a hotel room enjoying an afternoon tryst. They are in love, but the problem is that Sam is married and can't afford to get a divorce. No problem, actually. Marian happens to work at a bank. So, later, she steals a bundle of cash ($40,000) and heads off to Los Angeles where Sam lives. During her road trip, this blonde beauty tires and checks into the Bates Motel. There, she meets the odd, bird-like hotel proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She converses with Norman in his scary, bird-filled parlor and soon comes to realize the strange relationship he shares with his mother. Soon, out of left-field, Marian is slashed-off in what is probably one of the most famous scenes in movie history - the wet and bloody shower scene. This was certainly a film first - the demise of the main character halfway through the picture (it was actually an experiment by Hitchcock to gauge audience reaction). Now what? Well, an investigator (Martin Balsam), Sam, and Marian's sister Lila (Vera Miles), all converge on this house of horrors to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Marian. What will happen? Who will survive? It's all too suspenseful and fun.

The acting is on a tremendous level and Hitchcock's direction, as always, is just awesome. Plus, it is impossible not to love the violin-drenched soundtrack by composer-extraordinarre, Bernard Herrmann. ""Psycho"" is a historical event. Not only because of the top-notch production itself, but because of the facts behind the film. For instance, did you know that the infamous shower scene that only lasts 45 seconds, took Hitchcock one week to film to his satisfaction? It's interesting to note, too, that actress Miles was chosen for the role of Lila as a consolation prize of sorts. See, Hitchcock had cast her as the lead in 1958's ""Vertigo"", but she became pregnant just before production. Therefore, Kim Novak got the dual role. But Hitchcock didn't forget about the lovely Miles, giving her a role in one of the most famous movies ever. Also, ""Psycho"" was a work of secrecy and surprise. Hitchcock bought the original novel by Bloch, from Bloch, for $9,000, anonymously. Then he bought as many copies of the book that he could find, just to keep the end a secret. Then, when ""Psycho"" was released in theatres, Hitchcock had strict instructions with the theatre owners not to let anyone in the film late, since Leigh's role was so short and she was billed as the ""star"". This is a terrific film in every aspect. No wonder ""Psycho"" was listed by the American Film Institute, in 1998, as one of the 100 Greatest American Films.

4 May 2014,Classic,"I generally find the oldest movies are overrated just because they are ""classics"" but this truly is a classic. It may be slower than most modern movies today, although you really follow the plot, and feel the evil and insanity that lies within Norman Bates. The only problem I found with this movie was it had a little bit of a slow start. Once the movie gets rolling though it becomes a suspenseful thriller filled with memorable scenes, some you may have seen with out even watching the movie. The movie contains a great sequel 22 years later that holds up just as good as the first. You will feel like this was the first real horror movie ever made (although it's actually not) This truly is a timeless classic. If your a horror fan or even just a movie fan in general you must watch this, you want regret it.

28 December 2015,Simply the Best Mystery Movie of All Time,"There are rarely any movies that revolutionize a whole genre. Hitchcock's Psycho is undoubtedly one such movie. The movie unfolds at a pace which is perfect according to modern standards. It is a guarantee you'll be spiked on your seats for the entire length of the movie. The acting is outclass with special reference being to Anthony Perkins, the stammering motel manager and of course Vera Miles (also John Gavins acting for me). Hitchcock brings out his best direction techniques and methods in this movie. Everything about this movie just stands out, its cinematography, acting, direction, story telling.. just everything. The plot, though simple, is created with so much suspense that you'll be submerged into the movie. The climax may well be the best we have ever seen (not even comparable to climax in The Usual Suspects). For the climax alone i would rank the movie 10/10. This is one horror/mystery movie that revolutionized the way mystery movies were made. All assured, Vera Miles' screaming picture would be etched in your mind for a long time. A definite watch.

22 October 2008,"Mother ! Oh God, Mother ! Blood ! Blood !!","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8

20 July 1999,So creepy because it's not as far-fetched as some others.,"I saw this movie for the first time two weeks ago, and it was the greatest I've seen in my life. You could believe, no, wait, you HAD to believe every word Norman said, until you find out his terrible secret, even if you'd seen it before, or known the truth (like I had). It was, however, a shame to know that the final shot of Norman probably sealed Anthony Perkins' fate of being type-cast as Norman Bates forever, he did that good of a job. Janet Leigh was also incredible, as were Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam. Even if they only had three lines, anyone in this flick made it what it is. The shower scene looked, and sounded, real. The thing that's so freaky about this movie is that it could happen to anyone, it's not about an impossible occurrence like other horror flicks.

8 November 2004,Much better than I expected. Amazing movie.,"When i rented this movie, I knew it was a classic but i didn't expect much of it. I didn't think it would be an amazing movie or scary at all. I have seen the birds, and some other Hitchcock movies which didn't scare me in any way, so i didn't think this one would either. Well this movie ended up creeping me out. I cant imagine how people reacted to it when it first came out in theaters in 1960. I love horror movies and not many scare me anymore but this one did.

I think it would have been even better for me if I hadn't heard it was based off of ed gein, because that sort of gave away the end for me. Do NOT let anyone tell you about this movie before you see it. It will ruin it for you! And Don't look it up. Don't want to give anything away... amazing movie

7 April 2012,A boy's best friend is his mother.,"Picking the best Hitchcock film to watch is an exercise that will totally frustrate you. There are so many great ones. When it comes to terror, no film can beat this one. Rear Window may edge it out (only by a hair) for excellence, but not for sheer terror.

I really didn't recall the humorous set up in the beginning with Frank Albertson, but it did provide a way for Oscar nominee Janet Leigh and John Gavin to finally find happiness. Hard to believe a boss (Vaughn Taylor) would allow an employee to take the equivalent of $277,000 to the bank alone.

I cannot understand why Oscar nominee Anthony Perkins wasn't at least nominated for his role here. I guess I couldn't think of one nominee that I could replace that year. Burt Lancaster won the Oscar for Elmer Gantry. Perkins did win at Cannes the same year for Goodbye Again.

There were some other great actors in the film: Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Anderson, and John McIntire (""Wagon Train"").

Great direction, great cinematography and a great story.",9

3 August 2014,A classic thriller with probably the best twist at its time,"Although the background conflict drive is introduced very early in the beginning, the story took quite a long time to build up until the first real conflict occurs. And it takes up to about half an hour to reach the real focus of the movie. The thriller aspect is kept very nicely using the conversation dialog with the camera shooting elsewhere or at outside of the conversation's room. The conflict's final climax is indeed a great twist. It may even be one of the best twists of its time. I like how the movie retains focus after the the character that has been the sole focus of the movie is depicted dead. The acting is just a decent one. What's quite irritating to me is that most of the male actors try very hard to have the fake commanding accent. Janet Leigh acted nice enough, though. She handled her gestures nice in making the conversations more alive.

A creepy movie that must have been utterly thrilling to audiences back in 1960. Has a great ending. This is the first Hitchcock movie I've seen, and I'm looking forward to the others.

16 December 2014,A horror thriller that will keep you hanging onto your chair!,"PSYCHO (1960)

Directed By: Alfred Hitchcock

Book Base: Robert Block Screen Play: Joseph Stephani

Music: Bernard Hermann Cinematography: John Russell Film Editing by: George Tomasini

Cast: Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates),Vera Miles (Lila Crane), John Gavin (Sam Louis), Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)

Psycho is an astounding film produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock is known for Movies with surprise endings while keeping you wondering what will happen next. This film is a must see for everyone, even those who do not like horror movies.

The movie is about a woman, Marion Crain (Janet Leigh)who seems to be a little on the naughty side, but honest. Marion is honest until the day she decides to steal $40,000 in cash from her employer. Marion leaves town by vehicle to be with her boyfriend who is penniless. Marion travels a long distance and starts to get tired and pulls into the Bates Motel. She has a surprise waiting for her there. The plot thickens from here. I will not go into plot detail for those of you who have not viewed the film, but the suspense is uncanny in the way Hitchcock directed the movie.

Hitchcock uses music and lighting in a way that draws the audience's full attention and makes the viewers become a part of the film. The suspense in this film is beyond comprehension, in the way that a person has not lived until you have viewed this film. No film of this time has been able to top this suspenseful thriller. The fact that the movie is in black and white makes the film unusually dramatic. Viewers thought Notorious was good, but Psycho is even better. Hitchcock has plenty of surprises and keeps his audience guessing. The dramatic lighting, camera angles, and suspenseful music make Psycho one of his best.

If you have seen the 1998 version of this film, it does not do Hitchcock's 1960's version justice. The camera angles and lighting are much better in the 1960 version and keep the audience in suspense throughout. The newer version has dead zones, and the suspense is broken up. The coloring in the later film does not give the audience the feeling of standing in the scene watching what is going on. The acting in the newer film is extremely poor and boring.

The 1960's original screenplay, Psycho is almost guaranteed to make you hang onto your chair throughout the movie, even if you are viewing a movie on a cell phone. I would not recommend watching this film alone for sure.

Reference: Hitchcock, A. (Director),(1960) Psycho (Motion Picture).",10
2 April 2016,Lin Chen-Psycho,"This film in the history of representative horror thriller is Hitchcock in the movie the most talked about a film. Can be said to be the film is Hitchcock completely meaning film on pure film expression, he abandoned the their previous film is known as some of the routines, truly completely through the vision rather than plot to stimulate the audience. Now, as long as people mention this film, often inevitably to say that the film in the classic bathroom murder scene. The film from the visual effect of speaking, for the audience is a can not forget the nightmare, and Hitchcock is the nightmare of genius maker. The reason why the movie cranked up black and white film is to avoid the audience have been bloodied visual stimulation, but even if is such a, Hitchcock through his magic movie technique is enough to let us warier.

6 March 2021,Hitchcock's Best,"It's funny to listen to Hitchcock fans debate what exactly was his best movie. It's right in front of their noses; just think to yourself out loud, what's the film he made in 1960 we still talk about? From Bernard Hermann's haunting musical score to the acting performance of a generation by Tony Perkins, you can sense the old master, Hitchcock, lurking in every frame of this masterpiece of horror cinema. Just think about this for a moment -- if you could save only one Hitchcock movie to preserve his history and method, what would it be? Psycho never gets old, it feels like a new thrill no matter how many times you've seen it.

1 June 2008,Efficient creepy thriller from Hitchcock,"I watched PSYCHO last night on TV and during the movie I was never bored. PSYCHO is no doubt one of the best of Alfred Hitchcocks work. He filmed a very interesting novel that the film industry of nowadays misses so much if you know what I mean. Yes, it is one of the very first original creepy psycho thriller ever published.

Each scene is accompanied with a well adapted music score. Then the camera-work is top and every character is well developed and performed. Anthony Perkins became in this genre the symbol of the perfect psycho killer and finally this role helped him to get a great star for eternity. What I didn't like therefore was the black and white cinematography. It would have been so nice to see those beautiful colors of the sixties.

If you liked it watch THE BIRDS or REAR WINDOW from the same director.

Final vote: 7/10.",7
4 August 2020,"""awesome movie, awesome act, awesome build, not perfect but almost perfect""","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

21 December 2013,Hitchcock Kickback,"In true Hitchcockian 'shades of grey' office worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) rashly decides to take a stash of cash from her employer and ditch Los Angeles to join up with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With her internal moral regret mounting, even conspiring against her to the verge of paranoia, she ultimately ends up in a dilapidated off-road motel run by the reclusive, but amiable Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who literally has skeletons hiding out in his closet. When Marion Crane famously gets gutted in the shower by Bates' mother, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and boyfriend Sam become aware of her disappearance and initiate a hunt. Similarly, her employer sends out detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to track down Marion and the stolen money.

With a movie so awash with interpretations and reviews, not much noteworthy can be added, except from personal input, especially from the future-past perspective, as in: How does ""Psycho"" hold up against its contemporaries? And as such ""Psycho"", one of Hitchcock's best works, has aged pretty darn well, outdoing a vast majority of by-the-numbers rip-offs, due to the the ambiguous societal commentary lingering in between the killer rampage. Norman Bates, despite his awkward presence and facial tics, is by no measure a crazed psychopath, who deals in excess, instead Hitchcock affords his main antagonist a very thoughtful character structure, which also helps to build tension. Hitchcock, masterfully, builds context and content, especially with regards to the interaction between Marion and Norman, each running away from their own demons, suggesting that the difference between the two is much less pronounced, than we would like to believe. This gruesome take hits best during a genuinely fresh conversation between the two in the hotel office.

Once the initial murder takes place, Hitchcock never lets go of a sense of tension, but the story focuses more on the thriller/horror essence, no longer affording space for such thoughtful commentary. Anthony Perkins carries the movie with his impish, offbeat, charm, delivering a still crisp and tense conversation with the nosey PI Arbogast. For the most part ""Psycho"" remains a gripping experience, even though age has caused many false notes to supplant true fright with corny music and overused shock gimmicks. As such the most famous scenes, including the bathroom murder and the big reveal, have lost their impact, referenced to death and outdone by the coming slew of slasher films. Possibly this even works for the better, as the much ridiculed sequences no longer define the movie, instead letting it breath by its own.",8

29 March 2023,Brilliant,"I just visioned the 2012 cut DVD version. Janet Leigh blink is cut out of this one and the version seems superior and more full overall. The extras showed the shower scene with and without the music. The music makes it very irky and dramatic but without works very well also in showing the loneliness of the victim, which is the reality of being a victim.

The acting is superb all over and this gives the film a lot of poise and ground in reality. We can only be grabbed. The storyline is also complex and the murder mystery takes over after the stolen crime mystery. This film marked cinema for good reasons.

2 December 1998,Quite possibly the best movie ever made.,"Alfred Hithcock's Psycho is one of the most amazing works I've ever witnessed. Even knowing somewhat how the movie ends, one can still be surprised by how it happens. Anthony Perkins did an incredible performance as Norman Bates, may god have mercy on Vince Vaughn's soul. This has definitely persuaded me to go rent the rest of Hitchcock's movies. I'm not old- 14 years old to be exact- but I know quality filmmaking when I see it. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie, you don't know what you're missing. I sure didn't.

12 May 2016,Lock Your Door When Taking A Shower.,"This is pure cinema at its brilliant best. Almost every scene is a stunning set-piece; the precise opening, Marion Crane's unsettling journey to the Bates Motel, the legendary shower scene and the equally gruesome and brilliantly filmed murder on a staircase, whilst Anthony Perkins' indelible performance and Bernard Herrmann's music score - all nervous twitches and jagged strings - rank with the very finest cinema has to offer.

""Psycho"" centers its themes on human vulnerability, betrayal, levels of corruption and madness making all of the above present in realistic ways throughout the movie. Psycho surprises the audience by breaking major film rules by killing off its central character mid movie. Hitchcock makes use of Macguffins throughout the movie such as $40,000 cash that Marion (Central Character) steals so that the plot and characterization of the movie can be propelled. The soundtrack of the movie is perfect due to the only composition being that of strings. It really creates the image of helplessness and gives strong impressions of screeching. Overall, ""Psycho"" is the masterpiece of horrors in the film industry and Hitchcock's direction is flawless.

Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9
4 December 1998,Probably the closest thing to a perfect movie,"I love this film and Hitchcock. Psycho is almost perfect from beginning to end. This film could be studied for years to come as how to make a film. Only the psychiatrist explanation at the end doesn't work. Hitchcock was a directorial genius and this might be his best, but it's hard to pick out of all of them.

29 October 2005,The delicious hair-raising terror of it all!,"As a teenage movie buff, three films profoundly affected me and this is one of them (the other two for the curious are ""War of the Worlds"" which I saw at far too young an age, and ""Witness for the Prosecution"" another Hitchcock effort with a completely unexpected gob-smacker of an ending).

All three I have watched since, ""War of the Worlds"", though still an impressive sci-fi, no longer terrifies me, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" I've seen over and over and still put on my top 50 best films of all time and Psycho, well Psycho remains in a class all by itself. I am still gripped by the wonderful confluence of a great plot, marvelously acting, a superlative director and a score that enhances all of the above.

No one needs details of the plot from me. Everyone knows the plot. I am a lifelong fan of the great Hitchcock so should mention I have a bias to all things Alfie. This remains one of his best and broke new ground when first released. Like the above-mentioned WFTP and ""The Exorcist"", movies now had a new twist; you could not be admitted to the theatre after the movie had started.

As one can imagine, this engendered great excitement for the cinema audiences. What would the ending be? What were all the blood and guts warnings all about ? We read stories of fans passing out in the theatres where Psycho was played. We could hardly wait. We could not even imagine in our fevered brains what Hitch had created and was going to wreak amongst us.

We were not disappointed. Psycho embodied every horror we had ever let fester at the edges of our imaginations and then some. The shower scene had our hearts and minds freezing over and gripping each other in delicious icy horror. The slashings did not have to be shown, barest glimpses of corpses were revealed. There was nothing graphic on screen. The true terror resided in our imaginations and lingers there still. Many of us lock windows and doors in our own houses when taking a shower; many of us have never taken a shower again.

Once in the seventies I saw the set where this was made, the old house on the hill, and the remains of the motel. Perhaps it is all gone now. What a thrill, to see where it all began, to walk in the footsteps of the great Alfred.

This is a 10 out of 10 for the breakthrough into a new genre of film-making. Absolutely faultless, unforgettable and imminently re-watchable. In magnificent black and white. Leigh, Perkins and supporting cast flawless. Bravo to all.",10
4 November 2005,It's a MUST SEE for anyone.,"It's my favorite movie EVER. It simply keeps you tense all the time. As I told my friends, ""It's a '60s black&white movie, and I tell you, I was scared"".

Anthony Perkins performance is just BRILLIANT. In the last scene he's really scary.

One last thing, (because I'm not good at writing reviews, though I HAD to write one for this movie), is that most young people say ""It's black&white, it's too old"", or ""It must be boring, old movies are too slow"". NONSENSE! As I have already said, it's a '60s black&white movie, and I was scared. So if you're one of those who say old movies are always boring, slow, and all that things people say; forget that, do yourself a favor, and watch this. Oh, and, after I watched this I sworn I would never say again that old movies are boring.

Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
23 February 2008,A Movie Out of Time,"It took me 48 years to see this movie. Not a fan of the horror genre, I generally avoid them. But there have been a few that I've see that are really good. Psycho is a good film but time has passed it by, it is a movie out of time and just does not carry the punch it did in 1960.

Technology advances degrade much of technique used in this film. Audiences today are too sophisticated to be drawn into a film like this. Modern horror movies depend heavily on special effects and not on the subtleties used in Psycho. Being released in black & white is an advantage and helps give the film a feel of being the classic it is.

Anthony Perkins is superb in the role as Norman Bates. Other than Martin Balsam and Perkins though, the rest of the actors deliver only average performances. The lines are rigid and often lame, again the effect of time passing the method by. Perkins however can take the worst role and give it smoothness.

I'll not reveal any spoilers but for a movie so referenced and so often used in comedy and serious pieces, it is impossible to see this movie today without knowing what happens to the main characters.",6
30 September 2022,MJM REVIEW,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

13 December 1998,Look at the movie as a whole,"Okay, I'll agree that the shower scene is one of the scariest in movie history. Hitchcock did an amazing job with that. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't measure up. The scary start whimpers away into a movie of confusion that can only be described as creepy at best, dull at worst. It's a classic, but that doesn't mean it's good.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
16 June 2020,A true masterpiece,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects.

1 April 2015,great film,"Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is an excellent film. I would consider it scary even compared to today's horror films. The keeps you thinking and has an awesome plot twist at the end that leaves you in awe at how well the script was written. Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh both played outstanding roles. The score and cinematography are both excellent. Hitchcock used some interesting shots such as the close up of the man falling down the stairs. Psycho is also known for its famous shower murder scene in the beginning that included the famous shrieking sound effect of horror films. Overall I give Psycho an 8/10 for its plot as well as its incredible acting.

10 December 2004,Yes Mother,"This is an amazing horror film. The black and white makes this movie even better. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should. It is great. This movie is very interesting and there is a shot sequence at the end that is replicated in the original Halloween movie which i found very interesting. If you are a horror fan or a movie buff or both you should see this movie. It is great. I have seem it sever times and it never gets old. I still haven't found Hitchcock in it though. maybe if you watch it you will find him. Definitely worth it to check it out if you haven't seen it. Once again this movie is a classic and worth you while. Great movie from an amazing director ten out of ten.

14 August 2011,Time has dulled Psycho's cutting edge but it's still worth watching,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is one of the most famous movies of all time. People who've never seen it are nonetheless familiar with the infamous shower scene and its spiky musical accompaniment. In a way, this familiarity works against the film, as does the parade of imitators down through the years.

I'll admit that I may not be the most objective judge of this film's merit. I first saw the pointlessly faithful remake and I also read Robert Bloch's novel (which is the same in most respects). So, the movie was basically 'spoiled' for me, though with all of the references in popular culture you'd be hard-pressed to go into the movie 'fresh' to begin with. For a movie that hinges on a pair of twists, that's a considerable issue. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have other impressive elements, though.

Janet Leigh received an Oscar nomination for her performance but as far as I'm concerned Anthony Perkins easily outdid her. He went unrecognized by awards bodies at the time but the character of Norman Bates is now one of the most famous creations in cinema. In support, Martin Balsam is a welcome sight while Vera Miles & John Gavin are acceptable though they aren't really given a lot to work with.

Meanwhile, Hitch's direction was expertly handled, as always, and it resulted in the last Oscar nomination of his career. The cinematography was also Oscar nominated but I wasn't especially impressed by it, though I will say that the Oscar-nominated set decoration/art direction was indeed worthy of recognition. Bafflingly, Bernard Hermann's now-legendary score seems to have been completely ignored at the time.

In the end, I think that ""Psycho"" ranks a bit below Hitchcock masterpieces like ""Rear Window"" & ""Vertigo"". Admittedly, there are some absolutely great parts but it also starts slow and has an overreliance on twists (which you might already know even if you haven't seen the movie). That's not even getting into the scores of lesser imitators that have explored similar territory over the years. So, while ""Psycho"" is undoubtedly a landmark film with some very impressive elements, I'd say that time has been kinder to its reputation than its content.",8
9 December 2019,Good Stuff,"Classic Norman Bates. This movie is pretty good. It brings on the horror and suspense. I honestly thought it was top rate. The Bates guy does a pretty good job. He seems normal enough but turns out to be a psycho. The movie is also pretty suspenseful with the woman inviting the man into her life. She thinks she's the one who's to be frightened of, and yet the tables turn.

Good movie. I would recommend.

25 July 2018,We all go a little mad sometimes...,"A-Z Horror Movie of the Day...""Psycho"" (R - 1960 - US)

Sub-Genre: Slasher/Thriller My Score: 8.3

Cast=7 Acting=10 Plot=8 Ending=10 Story=9 Scare=7 Jump=6 F/X=7 Intense=9 Twist=10

A Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother.

""I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing."" This was where Alfred Hitchcock to the line you could not cross in censorship and buried it behind the Bates Motel. Considering the movie is almost 60 years old, it can still hold up with its intensity and terror. If you haven't seen this, then you must have gone a little mad...we all go a little mad sometimes. This is a must see for any horror movie fan!!",8
7 May 2007,Where It All Started,"The Plot = In the hopes of living happily ever after with her boyfriend (Gavin) whose getting divorced from his ex wife and still paying her keep, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals 40 grand from her place of work and leaves town and ends up at the creepy ""Bates Motel"" where she meets the shy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and well lets just say everything goes wrong for her after that.

Well what can I say about Psycho that hasn't been said a thousand times before, well nothing only that I agree with all the hype and excellent reviews that I've read and has definitely stood the test of time through the years.

In my opinion Psycho is definitely the one that ranks the top of the genre list, and if it wasn't for ""Psycho"" we've probably wouldn't have had all the great slasher flicks through the years such as the successful ""Friday The 13th series"", Halloween series, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Black Christmas. All of which pays dues to this masterpiece, I mean if Psycho weren't made we may wouldn't have had all them slasher movies. I mean Psycho in my opinion inspired all these movies in some way but directer Brian De Palma is the one who uses Psycho/Hitchcock idea for many of his movies.

Shot in black and white which does put some small minded people off and in my opinion it shouldn't, I think it wouldn't have had the same creepy atmoshere if it was shot in colour just look at the terrible remake which came out in 1998, but the less said about that the better i'd say. Brilliantly written and structured screenplay wouldn't have been half as effective with the proper casting, but Psycho definitely delivered in that department with performances from Janet Leigh who plays the unlucky Marion Crane who gives an vulnerable and sympathetic performance that had me siding with her despite her dishonest actions, Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates) was mesmerising in his touching, unsettling, insecure and layered role which nobody else in this world would ever compare to, I'd say he gives an Oscar worthy performance. Vera Miles (Lila Crane) Marion's sister gives a good performance as does Arbogast the unlucky private detective played by Martin Balsam gave an interesting performance. John Gavin (Sam Loomis) was OK, underplayed but didn't really do much.

All in all Every element came together here to make this a visually arresting picture, directer Alfred Hitchcock was truly one of the greatest of all time and was definitely spot on with Psycho which is definitely his finest film ever.",10
27 February 2019,A classic!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power.

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago.

We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie.

22 December 2022,10/10,"Inside every tough guy there's a little psycho, and inside every psycho there's a teensy-weensy mother just waiting to jump out and grab a knife with her cold, dead hand (gulp). So celebrated British director Alfred Hitchcock would have us believe after watching his original psycho-drama of 1960.

Born in London (Leytonstone), Al began in Silents, first directing rom-drams, then suspense (The-Lady-Vanishes The-39-Steps). Like many proven English makers, he'd cross the Pond, then the N. American continent to the USA's movie mecca, Hollywood, expanding his repertoire on makes like Mr-&-Mrs-Smith Rear-Window Rebecca Saboteur and Strangers-On-A-Train, eventually focusing his energies on one genre. And of his vast catalog, two films stand out, cementing his place atop the hierarchy of horror directors: Psycho (60) and The-Birds (63), both ingenious tales set in eerily everyday circumstance, the latter airing on 70s TV with frequency (What's a little eye-gauging and tortious bird behavior, anyway, right?), and Psycho, with its famous chef salad shower scene and weird mother-son dynamic, proving too graphic for censors who sometimes DID know best. But with cable's arrival (80s) and codes liberated, all of us finally got to check in the Bates Motel, assuming all risks and liabilities appurtenant (gulp).

Psycho clearly crossed the line, but because it did so with style (Stefano & Bloch), its shocking visuals would change movies forever (how censors ever let it show in theaters is a small miracle, or deal made with the devil). Innovations in camera and edit, along with better developed characters fueling suspense, give it the edge over the feathered freak-show. It stars Anthony Perkins as charming but demented desk clerk Norman Bates in the role that made him as legendary as Hitchcock. Janet Leigh plays his gorgeous guest who jumps from the criminal frying-pan (APB) into the victim's fire, learning the hardest way possible that 'crime never pays!' Other contributors: lens-man John Russell (his frame and pull-back from the eye of a corpse is exquisite), music score by Bernard Hermann (the piercing note that powers the shower scene may be the most famous single tone in all of cinema) and editing by the highly under-rated George Tomasini (Rear-Window Stalag-17 Vertigo The-Misfits The-Birds The-Time-Machine).

Missed the mark: 1) At first meet, Norman is too normal for what lay ahead, his ""mother"" and ""madness"" mentions a little too cute; 2) John Gavin's Sam is almost as weird as Norman, his attempts to fluster Bates enough to get the boyfriend tossed on his ear anywhere else, but then Loomis has his uses, and 3) I could've done without the last five minutes of psycho-splaining from the good doctor (Oakland) in prep for Bates' legal defense (incompetence in Arizona), and yet, still a masterpiece (4/4) (5.26.18).",10
30 June 2001,The best of the Hitchcock canon,"Probably the best of all of the Hitchcock films, mostly due to the surprise mid-film demise of the film's main character. The basic problem with any suspense film is the audience can be secure in the knowledge that the big-name star will survive the film--somehow. Psycho breaks this tradition and throws the audience a completely unexpected curve. Psycho also demonstrates what a good director can do with a low budget and, basically, a one-set picture. Good performances all around, particularly from Perkins. Nearly a perfect piece of cinema, marred only by occasionally sloppy editing and a few unfair red herrings, such as using an actress (Virginia Gregg) as the voice of ""mother"" instead of having Perkins do it. Brilliant Bernard Herrmann score uses only strings. Title sequences by Saul Bass seamlessly set-up the story. Would-be horror film directors need to thoroughly understand what makes this film a masterpiece before they shoot their first frame of film. There is almost no blood or on-screen violence.

10 March 2006,The grandfather of all slasher films,"Master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock's already tremendously successful career reached arguably a new height with Psycho, a powerhouse film way ahead of its time (the filmmakers even seemed to realize this fact; the film's tagline was ""A new- and altogether different- screen excitement!!!"") which inspired and pretty much pioneered the slasher film genre. It's the story everyone knows, with innocent worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) running from the law with a stolen $40 000, making the mistake of checking into a certain infamous motel along the way, run by a quirky and antisocial proprietor (Anthony Perkins) and his mysterious, never seen mother.

The key to Hitchcock's classic as opposed to the hundreds of generic garbage teen slasher films theaters are unfortunately bombarded with every year, is the suspense element. Hitchcock proves his genius by realizing that the key to truly inspiring fear in the hearts of an audience is by showing less rather than more. Instead of having horrendously gory deaths every 30 seconds we have a single, infamous shower stabbing, which becomes all the more chilling by how we as an audience have to essentially imagine exactly what is happening.

What is truly frightening about Psycho is the eerie tension constantly building throughout the film, reaching a point of almost feeling tangible it is so vivid. This is of course helped by the truly creative and innovative camera work, representing the film's spirit of being way ahead of its time. Psycho is perhaps one of the most cleverly shot films in cinema history, which only amplifies the feeling of dread throughout, ably backed by Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.

The film also boasts some rather spectacular acting, especially for its time period. Anthony Perkins is nothing less than superb in his infamous performance as the eccentric, socially awkward Norman Bates. Perkins creates a genuinely believable character, who is all the more unsettling and yet captivating by how strangely realistic as a real person he is. Janet Leigh also helps maintain the excellent tone for the movie with her iconic performance as on-the-run Marion Crane. Vera Miles also gives a strong performance as Lila, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam is great as the Detective searching for Marion.

Psycho can be considered as nothing less than a classic, withstanding the test of time and coming off as just as masterfully made and honestly tense and frightening to this day. Fueled by excellent acting, and helmed by a master of the craft, Psycho is now one of those movies which would be considered almost essential viewing. Simply put, if you have yet to see this movie, don't continue to miss out!

13 July 2003,A Masterpiece.,"First let me share with you why this film scares me:

Norman Bates killed Marion Crane on the day and the year I was born.

It's true!!!

I often wondered why my mom called me Psycho a lot as I was growing up. Now, I know.

All jokes aside, this is a Masterpiece of work. You have an excellent screenplay. Excellent actors. Excellent Direction. This film will scare you, thrill you, shock you and even make you laugh...

Where to I begin?!?! Camera techniques used to enhance the drama, that creepy house by the motel...unfaithfulness, men in womens clothing, Odepus Complexes, drinking, lying, cheating, stealing,...adams apples!!!

Psycho has it all.

This is the film film students must see and there are darned good reason's why. No one does it like Hitchcock (No, not even YOU Mr. DePalma) and this is one of HIS top 10 too.

I'll sound like one of those old women in a rocking chair on the porch: ""Oh yeah, Hitchcock did it first. All the rest of them - that Speilberg fella...that Lucas guy...That Jackson dude, you name it..they all got their technique from ole Hitch.""

Here it is folks, one from the ""master"". One of the best there is.

Enjoy.",10

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
20 February 2004,FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For being known as the `Master of suspense' Hitchcock is definitely successful to fulfill the title he has been given. Psycho wasn't exactly a horrifying experience, however for its time is was quit a spooky film. The techniques used for lighting, camera angle, and music are absolutely phenomenal and very powerful.

For example in one scene of this film, the main character is driving her car and the camera is angled at her face head on. The lighting outside of the car is gloomy and somewhat dark, and the music was extremely intense. The entire mood and atmosphere of this scene made everyone migrate to the edge of their seat, and their knuckles white from gripping their arm rests.



Also very powerful, and wise, was the symbolism that Hitchcock used throughout this film. For example in the beginning we see the main character sleeping with a man in her hotel room. She is clothes with a white skirt, and a white bra. A few scenes later, after she has commited a robbery, she is back in her hotel room wearing a black skirt and a black bra. The fact that she has just commited a sin, and is now dressed in black, is a great example of powerful symolism.

The camera work was most definetly phenomenal. Part of the movie takes place in or at a hotel complex, and the house that the owner lives out is at the top of a little hill right behind the hotel. The house looks incredibly frightening but the angle that the camera shoots at makes it even more scary, and definetly gives you the chills.

I do not wish to get into any more detail regarding this film, because I don't want to spoil it for the viewer. However, I would definitely suggest watching psycho. I have yet to hear of anyone who is not satisfied with this film, and I doubt that I ever will. I rate this movie at a 10 for being 100% extraordinary!!! I suggest it to anyone wanting a good spook, or even just someone who enjoys watching brilliant writing put into motion and displayed through this wonderful and enjoyable movie!",10

24 February 2011,The Undisputed Master Of Suspense: Alfred Hitchcock.,"Considered by many to be Hitckcock's best film, the film depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who is in hiding at a motel after embezzling from her employer, and the motel's owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and the aftermath of their encounter.

The film is based on the screenplay by Joseph Stefano, who adapted it from the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The novel was based on the crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein.

Psycho was, by a large margin, the top moneymaking film of Hitchcock's career, earning $11,200,000.

The film spawned two sequels, a prequel, a remake, and a television movie spin-off.

Verdict: add to your DVD collection and enjoy on your home theater.",10

27 September 2003,One of the Greatest Slashers,"Not only is Psycho is classic slasher, but it is such a well-filmed piece of work. Creepy music and lots of psychology cover this album. There is a constant chilling atmosphere. There is so much to this. So much.

If you want scares, chills, and a suprise ending (and a chilling very end), this has it all. And to think this was 1960! Go Hitchcock!

Rated.....I dunno, but violence, some gore and thematic elements are here.

14 January 2021,"Janet Leigh was born on July 6th, 1927","Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, gives us an amazing dose of thrills and chills, with this groundbreaking film. Along the way, he also creates a couple of Hollywood icons, when he introduces the world to Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Hitchcock always was a man who wanted to do things differently from what other directors did. He always said, that great storytelling comes from showing the audience what will happen. If there is a bomb under the table, then show the audience the bomb. He wasn't afraid to take chances doing things to his main characters, that were unconventional in modern film of the time, in order to draw the most shock from the audience. In the case of Psycho (1960), he delivers that with a punch.

A young woman, Marion, who comes into a lot of money, leaves town and ends up off the beaten path at a quiet, but intimidating little motel for the night. She meets Norman, the motel owner and his ""mother"", a woman who Marion never sees, but knows that she is there. She hears Mrs. Bates having conversations with Norman from their house, on top of the menacing hill, overlooking the motel. What happens after this, becomes a major part of film history. For those of you, who have never seen Psycho (1960), that is all I am going to say about the plot. If you have never seen Psycho (1960), you need to. It is important because it does represent a milestone moment in film history, for so many reasons. It is required viewing for film history buffs and cinephiles everywhere.

Hitchcock uses all of his camera techniques, editing tricks and his moody uses of light. He completes some of the best composited camera shots ever seen. Also, the use of sound is also used brilliantly in this film. It is the clever use of audio, that really creates the suspense found in the film. Hitchcock uses audio to point out certain plot points, without jeopardizing any of the secrets. It is an excellent way of story-telling. It is the type of storytelling used to create tension and suspense in every scene. It is so successfully executed, that the film knocks you for a loop, especially midway through the film. It is here, that his brilliance shows to us why he never was a traditional director and why he enjoyed crossing the line with his main characters.

9.0 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9
27 January 2021,the best movie all time,"This film is a masterpiece of art for all time. Alfred Hitchcock's best film and one of the best directors in the history of cinema. A beautiful and scary story with brilliant games.

Interestingly, Quentin Tarantino imitated this film in Pulp Fiction. The scene where Janet Leigh looks at her boss in the back of the car is similar to the scene where Bruce Willis looks at Marsellus Wallace behind the wheel in the street. 10/10

16 November 2008,Superior Thriller of Mind about Mastermind,"If buffs of ambitious movies search timeless horrors, they usually encounter PSYCHO by Alfred Hitchcock, the movie that, in a way, has become a sort of cult movie watched all over again in various places on earth. Yet, such movies usually lead us to a dilemma of high expectations and the subjective reactions after first viewing.

When I decided to see PSYCHO for the first time, I was surprised with one feature that from the very beginning and throughout the whole movie caught my attention: intellectual authenticity. That concerns all aspects from performances to soundtrack and script. Since PSYCHO by master director Alfred Hitchcock was released almost 50 years ago and has already ""experienced"" the test of time, we could well expect this movie to occur dated due to its black and white nature and allegedly old fashioned acting. However, what appears to all viewers is just the opposite. The movie still impresses as a clever story, still shocks as a horror, still stuns with its cinematography and soundtrack as a work of art.

Who can possibly ignore the flawless thrill in various moments of the film that remain in memory for long, moments of stunning cinematography, marvelous lighting that make black and white more attractive than lots of top visual effects? Except for the famous shower-murder scene that combines gore with sexuality and thrill with empathy, there are really breathtaking moments that lead the viewer to the extent of ""orgasmic"" trance of mind. Consider for instance, Marion (Janet Leigh) driving a car and her thoughts of various sorts. Another moment worth attention is Marion - Norman conversation...someone would perhaps ask ""what's brilliant about it?"" Everything! It is simply the moment of mental power that I have hardly found elsewhere, you, as if (of course illusively) get into the mind and perception of this man, into his peculiar hobby, into his very island of ""divided"" self. The shot of Norman's house with cloudy sky in the background makes an enormous effect. And here, it's a must to mention the marvelous scene of Lilah (Vera Miles), Marion's sister approaching the house... How wonderfully filmed, what a soundtrack, what a power of illusion and bliss of thrill! Nowadays, one can only imagine how innovative and convincing the film must have been in 1960...

The performances in the film are sublime. I find all of the acting remarkable but if I were to choose the three most memorable ones, I'd say: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles/Janet Leigh and Martin Balsam. I know that this choice may seem inaccurate to some readers but that is my personal opinion. Perkins gives a masterwork of performance embodying a character of true psychological contradictions that we find later, as we get to know him better. Naturally, psychology is hidden, innate and far from being discovered as easily as looks. Perkins had a very difficult task in this film, some of the hardest ones ever, but he crafted it perfectly, including his final scene... Perhaps you wonder why I have combined Vera Miles and Janet Leigh together but it was done deliberately. The two portray sisters and occur to me as true sisters of the same authentic depiction of fear, of curiosity, of sexual appeal. There could not be a better choice for these roles than the two. Finally, Martin Balsam as private detective Arbogast is brilliant focusing on strong personality ready to cope with suspicion and terror. His scene with Norman is unforgettable with this truly accurate wordiness of investigation.

But I feel that the gist of why PSYCHO was such a blockbuster and has been popular for all these years is neither its artistic side including performances, cinematography, soundtrack, nor even the direction. Its key of success lies in the fact that it is a horror of a psyche set partly within the psyche. It is not a series of shocking scenes with monsters, ghosts or imaginary creatures but the film rooted in the very riddle of human mind, distorted as it may seem yet pretty universal. The scenes we get near the end of the film, perhaps seem hardly real as if not of this world but after longer inspection, it appears they all make a perfect sense. Therefore, the reason for its authenticity is foremost the movie's psychological aspect memorably presented. Strange numbers add to the mystery of all and the atmosphere works for the rest.

All in all, PSYCHO is an unforgettable film, a pearl in the genre and a true model for many modern thrillers that turn either to kitsch or to cheap entertainment. Hitchcock's film is an example of how cinema can entertain, shock, provoke and also educate a bit. If you're looking for your island of escape from decadent and meaningless effects in modern horrors, go to something original and see PSYCHO, a superior thriller of mind.",9
28 July 1999,The Classic Mystery!,"Psycho is definitely the best Hitchcock movie, and the best mystery movie of all time. Maybe it's not a really scary movie, but it is great and dramatic. It kept me guessing until the end. The end scene had to be the scariest, much better than the infamous shower scene. Anthony Perkins is brilliant, along with some other cast members. It makes you think long after the movie. I would give it *** out of four or a B+.

22 April 2020,Psycho Analysis,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
9 April 2023,Best movie of its generation,"Alfred Hitchcock. A director that was so ahead of his time man. Creating great movies such as The Birds, Vertigo, Rear Window, and Psycho. Psycho really does stand out to me though. Everybody knows about the famous shower scene, and that was about as much knowledge that I had going into this movie. I was unaware of the mother twist at the end but it was absolutely shocking to me. Anthony Perkins! Great role for him and he did just amazing. That ending scene where he does the Half-Kubrick stare had me shook and tense. The plotline admittedly starts a little slow, but it all changes at around 40 minutes in. Unforgettable Movie, Ahead of it's time, inspirational are all things that have been said about this movie. Go watch it and write your own review.

21 November 2019,Questionable ending of an amazing thriller,"I would normally discount some points for the sudden conclusion and unnecessary exposition, but considering that it was 1960, maybe it was neccesary.

Besides that, the incredible performances from Vera Miles and Anthony Perkins brought to life such a duo of complex and superb characters, with the use of the highest level of acting, including complete body and facial expressions, helped by a great and natural dialogue that made the intriguing plot to grow in tension with every minute, flowing with total harmony right until the last couple of scenes.

15 January 2022,Classic!,"Must have been revolutionary for 1960! Great story. Kept me guessing and took me by surprise a lot. Mostly good acting and locations. Well filmed, fitting music, but over used in some areas. Still, by the end, I was loving it all. I'm surprised I had waited this long to see this.

6 November 2009,"""A boy's best friend is his mother.""","My Take: A landmark thriller from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock.

Familiar even to anyone who hasn't seen the film itself, from its famous sequence that has been imitated and parodied several times to its undeniable influence in the horror genre, Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO has since become a part of cinematic history. But with such influence it has made, you'd think the genuine article has lost its touch. That ain't so. Seeing PSYCHO today, the classic still retains its ability to shock on a first time viewing and to give you the creeps even if you've seen it twice or more times.

We all know its influence in the several generations of slasher movies, but what still places PSYCHO is that it's less like the horror films it inspired than another thriller masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock; it's a well-crafted and intelligently written thriller, a quality that has slowly lessened in many of the slashers that have followed. Who could forget Janet Leigh in her performance that would make her famous in horror filmdom (and earn her an Oscar nomination) as the doomed Marion Crane. But any conversation about PSYCHO wouldn't be complete without the mention of Anthony Perkins superb performance as the infamous Norman Bates, a slightly maladjusted owner of the desolate Bates Motel. Perhaps the guys at the Oscar's were simply shocked and shivered by his chilling portrayal to give him the Oscar nomination he most certainly deserved. The supporting performances, especially by Vera Miles, are strong enough to carry the rest of the picture.

Everything seemed to be pitch perfect about PSYCHO: As usual, Bernard Herrmann teams with Hitch and provides a chilling score that will forever etched in our memories. The infamous shower scene, while no longer as shocking, is still one of the most expertly crafted sequence ever made; it's use of montage is still being scrutinized and studied by any film student today. George Milo, Robert Clatworth and Joseph Hurley's art direction is superb, from Norman's office parlor inhabited by stuffed birds to the famous Bates residence (complete with a silhouette of Mother in the window) is legendary and relevant to the many goings-on at the mysterious Bates Motel. The black-and-white photography does more than just make the censor approve the film, it also suites the film's ample atmosphere (blood in B&W is creepier than color). All this and so much more (not to mention the first-ever on-screen flushing of the toilet) make PSYCHO the father (or is that Mother) of them all.

Rating: ***** out of 5.",10

20 June 2006,Norman Bates: an unassuming hotelier who wouldn't hurt a fly,"This was the fifth and final film of Alfred Hitchcocks impressive directorial career to earn him an Academy Award nomination for best director. His other nominated films as a director were Rear window, spellbound, Life Boat and Rebecca. He never won the Oscar. This time around he lost out to Billy Wilder for The Apartment. What he accomplished from this innovative low budget film probably should have won him the Oscar. This is a low budget film for Hitchcock that in toady;s dollars would have cost about $5 million to make. The film was adapted from the 1959 lackluster novel by Robert Bloch by screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Cinematographer Jack Russell got an Academy Award nomination for photographing this film but no major film offers because of his work, He had did Orson Welles' Macbethe early in his career and was mostly involved in television and a few B movies before and after Psycho. He does a great job here along with film editor George Tomasini who edited Stalag 17, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Birds and Cape Fear among his many fine films. A memorable music score from Bernard Herrman who did such films as Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Vertigo and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This is the story of a woman who steals $40,000 dollars and has plans to run away with her married lover but sees her plans and the life she lived evaporate so on the run she stops at a rundown motel off the beaten path that sits in the shadow of an old decapitated wooden turn-of-the-century mansion where the motel keeper lives with his aged mother. It's a classic horror setting and filmed in black and white. Janet Leigh in an Academy award nominated performance as Best Supporting Actress is the woman on the run and Anthony Perkins is the motel keeper who has been hounded by his domineering mother all his life and functions in his lonely existence as a motel keeper of a motel that no one stops at anymore. Also among the cast are Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Gavin and John McIntire. This film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction for it's great set. It's a fairly simple story with twists and turns and a little black comedy thrown in. It's a classic and comes across as kind of a bonus prize for followers of Hitchcock like he was saying here's something a little different for you to check out. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",9
10 May 2009,Psycho is a refreshing example of true horror and intensity,"Marion Crane (Leigh) runs away from her job and life with a huge amount of money at her disposal when she stops at the Bates hotel and meets troubled Norman (Perkins) When exploring the most successful horror films of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho will more than likely crop up amongst others including Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street or Scream. There have been many changes to the genre over the last couple of decades, perhaps the most significant when the genre went digital with the psychologically frightening Blair Witch Project. But as times grow many horrors are spurned with little effect on the viewers who expect someone hiding with typical music and degrading stereotypes, for example The Hole.

Psycho, released in the early 1960's, may have lost an edge in sharpness with technology inevitability taking control over scares but the shock and drama encoded remain intact and is still a favourite amongst horror fanatics and the shower scene is still debated as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best.

Starting off Psycho sets Janet Leigh and John Gavin debating their future and soon Leigh has money and sets off on her own. This act of selfishness and greed brings viewers right up to scratch as her angelic image is far from her devilish actions and we soon have a thriller on our hands. And soon we also have Anthony Perkins to contend with.

Perkins brings a sharp and twisted shock to the story with a disturbing portrayal of a lonely man wanting company and as we see his stalkerish obsession mixed with his bizarre hobby we dive right into the infamous scene and the shock will surprise and entertain you with a swirling and dramatic depiction of the consequences by Hitchcock.

Again the English director shows a sharp intensity in story telling with fast moving montages and a clever use of bird eye view angles to capture the shocking story in its full intensity.

This horror drama has one of the finest musical scores I personally have ever heard for such a genre. The opening sharp cut title sequences and credits role with a finely established mixture of sophistication and sharpness that generates a feeling of excitement and tension to set you up for the film.

As far as horror films go these days you will see a helpless stereotype waiting for the inevitable to happen. Therefore it is refreshing to know that some classic horrors will still shock and surprise and Psycho is at the top of that list.",9

Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",
5 February 2010,Psycho is still frightening after all these years.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass.

5 October 2002,A classic,"I simply had to see this film, I had just heard so much about it - though admit I didn't really know anything of the story. Back in 1960 this must have been so scary. The story is truly chilling. That old house was so creepy. Well acted by an attractive cast and superbly directed. Don't let the fact it's in black and white put you off - it just makes it a lot creepier. The other thing worth mentioning is the fabulous music. One of my all time faves.

6 July 2013,A Masterstroke - Psycho is simply brilliant,"What can I say about Hitchcock that hasn't already been said so many times before? The man was an absolute genius and I adore his work. And just to get it all out of the way I love Psycho, just in case that wasn't already clear.

In the late '50's and early '60's there was a flurry of low budget, mostly B&W horror/thriller/suspense movies made. Think the work of Wiliam Castle(The Tingler, House on Haunted Hill, Macabre)as an example. These proved mostly very popular with audiences, and it was this trend that sparked Hitchcock to try his hand at the same formula. The result was Psycho.(as a side note William Castle in turn made ""Strait-Jacket"" as a direct response to Psycho) The true strength of Psycho, for me, lies not in the Famous Shower scene or the brief outbursts of violence(few as they are) heightened by Bernard Herrmann's now signature score. The true strength of this film lies in the casting of Antony Perkins and Janet Leigh. They portray their respective characters perfectly. Watching the subtle nuances in their performances, the minor changes in expression, the inflections and tone of voice is just fascinating. There simply is no Norman Bates without Anthony Perkins.

Even to the very last scene Psycho keeps you enthralled where the big pay-off of the story is not stereotypically the apprehension of a maniac(or psychopath if you will)or the solving of a crime with the comforting knowledge that all is well again. Instead it comes with the realisation of just how far down the rabbit hole you've truly gone, and that ""Norman Bates"" can be anyone or anywhere. Be it the unassuming shy owner of a roadside motel or even your neighbour.

Psycho is simply a must see picture.",9
2 June 2013,Possibly the best film ever made! No Spoilers.,"I remember the first time watching this film (as I write this I am listening to Bernard Herrmanns wonderful score for the film), best Saturday night movie ever! Lights all turned off to add to the suspense. Its one of those films you can only really see once, but I have watched it more than 10 times! I think that the music for this film is amazing, from the opening credits to the infamous ""Shower Scene"". Obviously I would say it was Hitchcock's best (as a lot of people would agree) and the casting choice is brilliant, unlike the 1998 'disasterpiece' with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates(seriously?!). Anthony Perkins has got to be one of the greatest movie villains ever! I cannot recommend this film enough! It is just a masterpiece of cinema and every single person on this planet should see it!

P.S. Make sure it is the 1960 version you watch and NOT the 1998 remake!

20 August 2003,I'm not going to waste time writing this review,"There are movies that require a lot of thinking as to why they are great, then there are movies that are great because they are multi-layered yet complex on each layer.

Psycho is one such example. Hitchcock is marvelous in his manipulation of both the audience and the picture. To think this was robbed at the Oscar! Bernard Hermann, one of the greatest composers ever, proves his strength with total vigor. It is all to obvious why Hitch kept relying on him.

Simply put, this is required viewing to anyone. If it makes you want to take a shower again (I doubt it will cause any phobias of that)...so be it. Nonetheless, an important film that isn't afraid to be detailed with some pretty deep and disturbing material. I will take it over a billion Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street sequels any day, any time. No one will be able to match Anthony Perkins' eccentric mannerisms, not in a thousand years. Kudos to Hitch for casting him.

Overall, if there was one flaw I felt with this movie, it was that the shrink at the end did to much explaining to the audience and didn't allow Hitch to create something on his own that would have done the same job more effectively. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",10
5 January 2007,Hitchcok's best!,"Definitely Hitchocoks best, or the best Hitchcock film I've seen. the camera work and that superb score by Bernard Hermann makes this one of the greatest films ever made.

Anthony Perkins is undoubtedly one of the best villains in a movie that I've seen. So scary and unpredictable. The fact that Janet Leigh only made an appearance up to 40 mins or so into the film makes her appearance memorable and Norman Bates.

Contains one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. That score by Herman mixed with th illusions Marion supposedly being stabbed then the shot of the blood pouring into the plug hole is just unlike something that i've ever seen. Unfortunately I've given this 4.5 stars rather than 5 because the ending and the whole "" psycho killer"" thing has been done so many times over the last decade or so the film felt very familiar to me.

Overall definitely Hitchcock's best work and now I must watch some of Hitchcock's films done in the 40's. Definitely a film everyone must watch. Highly recommended!",9

22 December 2005,Just the best,"There is a before and after of this movie in the history of movies. Hithcook may be the director with more ""new things"" in his time. Is difficult to know how big could be he now in this special effects time. Psycho is a perfect combination of a great director, a great cast and a great script. Perkins makes his best job in this movie. Norman Bates is a legend. A lot of people did not see Psycho but everybody knows who is Norman Bates. The movie has a lot of symbols and the music is the best. Hitch confirms in this movie that good actors and good staff is enough to make a good movie. North by Northwest was excellent, but it cost 3 or 4 times more than Psycho. It is more than a cult film. Psycho is really a masterpiece. Psycho is a movie that you can watch 20 times and every time that you see it, found new elements. Is full of details. The subliminal presence of the mother figure is present in all the movie. The color of the under ware of Marion changes to black after she left the town trying to express that she feels dirty. And the scene of the bath... is maybe the most famous scene in the history... is difficult to perceive after that yo never saw a naked body and never so a knife inside of the victim. But during the sequence you're sure that it is happening. Psycho is magic... is a lesson to everyone who loves movies. I think that is necessary to watch this movie before to comment another one.",10
9 April 2001,Grand-daddy Of All Slasher Movies,"Not many people know it, but Robert Bloch loosely based his original novel on the story of Ed Gein, a farmer of Plainfield, Wisconsin who collected body parts from the cemetary and who killed two women. Almost too weird to be true, Bloch sensationalized the original story and created a top notch horror story which became a movie that started a whole new series of slasher and killer movies. Psycho is a masterpeice in direction, style, acting, writing, plot and execution. The story centers around that of a lovely, would-be female thief who absconds with a lot of money. The movies rotates around the movie's main character like a pin wheel before shooting in and absolving the story with a climax and one of the single most recognizable visuals in movie history. Anthony Perkins is a vulnerable but likeable maniac with a character, a far cry from his hockey masked and claw handed progeny. Janet Leigh proves how the shower is the most vulnerable spot for a person to be, and Martin Balsam creates a believable detective far from the trench coat gumshoes in the old nickel and dime stories. Spoofing the role later in the flick, Silence of the Hams, he proved just how far this movie has seeped into the consciousness of movie-goers.",10

Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
9 November 2019,cool,"Since the greatness of such a Director as Alfred Hitchcock can be said endlessly, then I, perhaps, focus my attention on acting. Psycho is definitely a Thriller with a capital letter. It is indisputable that it is quite difficult to judge the films that have passed through time, because of our impregnation with the culture of modern cinema. In addition, many Hitchcock classics may seem quite ordinary black and white picture. This happens to people whose eyes fundamentally do not perceive black and white classics. I must say that they lose a lot. Me same this the film hit immediately.

In General, I tend to evaluate the film, first of all, from the point of view of acting. I would like to highlight Anthony Perkins ' performance. Let me remind you that his hero is a psychopathic killer who lives as a hermit, creating even more fear about his image. It is necessary to pay tribute that such an image of the main characters of horror films, in turn, is often used in modern horror, which, above all, speaks of the classics of this picture. To be honest, the game Perkins hooked me not childishly. So I watched, literally with my mouth open. This eye that draws you to the screen, monotonous and at the same time sharp movements that speak about his unstable psyche of his character and cause a contradictory first impression, the famous smile - all these details, observed by both Hitchcock and Perkins, deserve praise. And what the film's production and acting do together is difficult to describe in words. I am a fan of non-standard acting. Expressiveness and emotionality used by actors is alien to me. Most of all in the game I like realism, when purely individual qualities of the actor help him not to overplay, that is, to adhere to the Golden mean. Perkins, for the most part, manages to intrigue the viewer thanks to his incredible male charm.

As for the work of Vera miles, the role of the weaker sex in A. Hitchcock is, first of all, the embodiment of femininity, which brings its unique charm to the picture, and therefore, speaking about her game it is difficult to find fault or comment on something. Women are an integral part of Hitchcock thrillers, and to me, her acting is no different from that of grace Kelly or Joan Fontaine. In his works, they act on a special pattern-either in danger or in the arms of a man. Thus, women in his films are an integral attribute, but not the basis.

Speaking of the film as a whole-it is certainly a masterpiece. It's all so coherent, clear and while watching there is a strange feeling that you-not the only observer, for the most part, because of the use of unusual angles. And, of course, the saddest thing that makes me think about this kind of classic is that such films are one of a kind and some techniques in modern cinema are no longer used.",10
2 May 2020,NICE,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie.

3 January 2023,Cult Classic,"This film is cult classic and for a reason, Norman Bates is the classic killer. The beauty here (or should I say horror) is not the supernatural and the scares and the gore but the sheer human behavior of someone who is mentally unstable, which in reality is the scariest thing of all.

You get introduced to Marion from the start and assume that she is the main character who I guess survives since she's been in the movie for almost an hour but then you get the classic shower scene after which so many people were scared to close their eyes while showering. I must add that I was pretty envious of the water pressure from the shower head in that scene, wish that was the case everywhere today. The scene itself has aged, the lack of blood was questionable and the way Marion was dying was a bit too theatrical (not to mention the stabbing was very fake).

Anthony Perkins does an amazing job portraying Norman, he wouldn't be an easy character to play.

The ending is great, it explains and ties the story well together.",9

5 October 2002,"The single greatest horror movie ever made, and one of the best movies ever made","It's hard to describe ""Psycho"". I can tell you it is the greatest horror movie ever made. I can also tell you it is one of the greatest movies ever made. I can tell you that Alfred Hitchcock's directing is simply flawless. No director will ever capture the suspense of a movie like Alfred Hitchcock did. I can tell you that there are no bad performances in this film, as every actor and actress in it was great. Anthony Perkins is truly frightening as the mentally sick Norman Bates. I can tell you that it contains one of the most famous and memorable scenes in movie history, the infamous shower scene. I can tell you that it is very scary, even by today's standards. But that doesn't begin to describe it completely. You simply have to see it for yourself.

14 October 2022,Honeymoon Hotel It's Not,"The '50s had been something of a success story for Alfred Hitchcock. He had done some great films, with some huge stars. Gary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Henry Fonda had all worked for him. In 1955, he also started ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", a TV show with millions of viewers. But now it was 1960. The director wanted to try something new.

In ""Psycho,"" Anthony Perkins plays a repressed young man named Norman Bates. He seems completely dominated by his disabled mother, but still tries to manage his run-down motel as best he can. One day, an attractive young woman (Janet Leigh) walks through the front door, setting in motion a fateful sequence of events.

Unfortunately, Paramount Pictures wasn't interested in the new project. In a desperate attempt to get ""Psycho"" made, Hitchcock offered to pay for the shooting himself if the company guaranteed to distribute the finished film. And ultimately Paramount said yes. Convinced that ""Psycho"" would be a box-office flop they also agreed to Hitchcock's demand for a 60% cut of the film's (unlikely) profit.

Hitchcock immediately set to work. To keep costs down, he only used personnel from his own TV series behind the cameras. And he shot the whole movie in black and white on a spare movie set. With a budget of $800,000, ""Psycho"" was the cheapest film Hitchcock ever produced.

Surprisingly, the picture became a smash hit at the cinemas. Thanks to his deal with Paramount, Hitchcock personally earned over $15 million from the box office. In the coming years, ""Psycho"" also became a successful franchise with three more new films, as well as a color remake of the original. Not bad for a tiny little flick that the movie company hadn't even believed in.",6

Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
17 March 2006,iconic,"'Psycho' is one of the most iconic films of all time, and this film had a huge impact with an audience, and it has been considered one of the best films ever made. It is the sort of film that haunts us with its gradual build-up to disaster, excellent cinematography, and its ability to allow the user to imagine the horrible events taking place. (The creepiness of this film is in the stuffed animals at the beginning of the film, the huge house upon the hill, the darkness of the night, and that unforgettable and iconic shower scene.) This film is the master of suspense with some great camera angles. Mr. Bates ascending and descending the staircase in the empty, creepy house with the body of his mother heightens the horrors. It is easy to put oneself in the place of the characters. This film will keep one engaged with the constant action and the mystery. There's even a little element of humour and disgust. This is definitely one of the best films of all time. Everyone should see this at least once in their life.

24 May 2023,I love this Movie,"One the best movies I ever watched Great acting, Great director Sir Alfred is a genius.

At the end of the movie i was like wow, It has a great ending that doesn't like other movies like vertigo but it is great

And about that murder in the shower scene, For that time and technology it is so great that i think no one ever could do something like that.

So if You didn't watch this movie don't hesitate because You'll miss a lot.

And it has a lot of details that although they're little but it made the movie to an another level. For example the architecture of the motel and the house a great paradox.!

28 December 1999,A MUST SEE!!,"Psycho is a classic, and a great watch. I t may not be the best movie like many people have claimed, the movie isn't very scary and the shower scene is very quick and over in a few seconds, but I guess it was made in the 60's when nothing like this had ever been done before. Yes I enjoyed it very much and I was thinking the whole way through. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman great, his friendly smiles, his comments his speeches ""We all go a little mad sometimes"") and just his general acting, the way he walked and moved. The story is Janet Leigh steals some money from her boss and takes off in her car to go to another city for the weekend. She stops off during a stormy night for a stay at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates. She gets into the shower in her room, but never comes out. Janet's family come looking for her, questioning all the places in the area, and they are curious about the Bates motel, for Norman isn't normal, and his loveable mother who sits in the house behind the hotel, isn't so loveable either. I long running time, but every second of it was needed and worth it. A must see!!

17 June 2004,"The best, bar none","So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine.

14 November 2019,The best horror movie of all time,"Psycho is the perfect example of a good horror movie. It's creepy, there's jumpscares, there's intense music, great cast, I could go on all day. This is a movie I could watch over and over again without getting bored. Psycho is a horror classic and is easily one of the best films of all time. Many iconic scenes have people recognizing this movie as a gem. Alfred Hitchcock made a true masterpiece. And who knew a horror movie released in 1960 would actually be nail-biting?

31 August 2022,An absolutely exquisite must watch,"I wholeheartedly loved all the characters that Hitchcock portrays, I especially enjoyed the crossover from Marion Crane to Norman Bates, as both characters have surprisingly a lot of similar traits that are being showcased. I found it quite intriguing as both characters break the fourth wall by looking directly into the camera, as well as when Marion crane portrays the feeling of being watched constantly after stealing the money, she continuously feels this way, as the office of Norman Bates also makes her feel watched. As she is deeply wary of the many birds there . In conclusion I cannot stress enough how this movie has so many intriguing and intricate scenes displayed throughout. Meaning that no review can truly entangle this masterpiece, so if you haven't watched it yet stop reading reviews and go watch it!

26 August 2023,Norman Bates!,"Wow!

This movie is so amazing even after so many years that you just can't compare it to any other horror movies of our times.

Norman bates is terrific here with probably the best performance of his career with his innocent charm and split personality, Janet Leigh gets a nomination in academy for her brilliant acting, an intense plot that keeps you on an edge and one of the most remembered score.

Alfred Hitchcock's direction does it again but this one for me is his greatest work of all time, a genius and one of a kind.

One of the best horror/slasher movies ever made, would always be remembered and thought upon in cinematic universe.

9/10 for this one!",9
21 December 2022,"Overrated, but still pretty good.","So this is probably one of the most controversial reviews I have written so before I will preface this by saying that this most definitely is a good movie. I am just writing this as a dude who likes films and my opinion is not a universal fact that everyone has to accept, watch the movie to form your own opinion.

Okay so I will just start by saying that the first 25 minutes of this movie are quite boring (IN MY OPINION) and I had to read the plot summary to even get that Marion Craine had (SPOILERS) embezzled money from a customer. But the following 40 minutes are still really good and it then leads into a pretty good third act

In conclusion, go see it if you want to see a Hitchcock movie.

24 July 2008,Truly Terrifying,"If you go on YouTube there are a number of short films that can be viewed from there. ""Psycho"" feels like one of those, both in its story and its construction (though ""Psycho"" is about 10 times longer than most of the shorts you'd find on the internet). That's part of its charm; it's simplicity gives Hitchcock a lot of room to work with, and really develop every last detail to create its greatest impact. The fact that the film survived almost fifty years (and a remake) proves that all the work paid off.

The less said about the story, the better (in fact, the best thing to do is to go into this movie knowing as little information as possible). I will say this: A woman (Marion Crane) has just stolen $40,000 from her boss and skipped town to join her boyfriend, and on the way she stops at a motel.

There are two names (of real people) that are always going to be associated with ""Psycho:"" Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins (arguably Janet Leigh would also be mentioned, but she doesn't create the impact that the other two do in my opinion). Both of them work wonders here. Hitchcock has created the perfect film; everything works so brilliantly that I can't even find words to describe it. Down to the last detail, Hitchcock meticulously constructed one of the most awesome and terrifying films ever to grace the screen.

People may not remember Anthony Perkins' name, but anyone who has heard of ""Psycho"" will recognize the name Norman Bates (which is the point of acting, though the opposite is the case in today's world). That is how effective his performance is. I recently watched ""The River Wild,"" where Kevin Bacon does a terrific job of portraying a character who is sympathetic in the beginning and a total psychopath later on. Anthony Perkins accomplishes the same thing, and his performance is a lot more effective. At the beginning, he's a young, boyish sort of man who is a motor-mouth at the beginning because he is absolutely smitten with the beautiful woman who has just stopped at his hotel. His charming personality slowly turns to being a frightening one as the movie goes on, and this is accomplished with the same effectiveness. It is especially noteworthy that he does this completely in sync with Hitchcock's direction.

The other actors are understandably overshadowed by the Hitchcock and Perkins, but to their credit no one can hold a candle to what they accomplished. Actually, the other performances are very strong. The females are the most successful, especially Vera Miles. Miles is the perfect anchor for the film. She finds a balance between anxiety and determination. Even though she is not given much to work with, she creates a sympathetic sister. Wide-eyed Janet Leigh is also good (though she overacts slightly at times) as Marion Crane, and her scene when she talks to Norman is delicately handled (though even she can't help but be out-shined by Perkins). Martin Balsam brings a noirish feel to his character, but he still fits right in. Like Perkins, John Gavin has a change of character, though he goes from charming to determined instead of psychotic. Gavin makes Sam Loomis easy to sympathize with.

James Berardinelli, a film critic that I greatly respect, said that ""Psycho"" is not Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film is not his best because it lacks the story and character complexity of ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo,"" the latter of which I have not seen. I respectfully disagree. Why? Because it doesn't need them. ""Psycho's"" simplicity works to its advantage, and it's clockwork like procession adds a deeper level of fear that a film with more complexity in any area would not be able to create.

I often say that ""Halloween"" is the scariest movie of all time. Strangely, though, I gave that film an 8/10 and this one a 10/10. The reason is because while ""Halloween"" is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen (and in some parts scarier than this one), it is not without flaws. ""Psycho"" is flawless and, maybe because it's been a few years since I have seen John Carpenter's film (and a lifetime before I will see it again), more polished. I also said that ""Halloween"" creates a high level of suspense with minimal violence, and that is true, but ""Psycho"" does it with even less.

Earlier in this review I said that it is better to go into this film knowing as little as possible. This is true, though ""Psycho"" is so well-known that many people already know a lot about it, especially the ending twist. I was one of those unfortunate souls who knew about it, and while I have to admit that a lot of the impact was lost because of this, Hitchock still delivers the goods well enough to warrant a viewing.

""Psycho"" was remade shot for shot by Gus van Sant in 1998. It would be interesting to see what difference there is in the two versions (though I've heard the remake is terrible). Still, I'm going to see the remake and be the judge. But maybe I'm making a mistake, for the reported awfulness of the remake may taint the praise I have for the original. That said, nothing, not even ""Halloween,"" can hold a candle to ""Psycho.""",10
19 January 2003,Psycho: 10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie is only forty-three years old, yet it rings fear into the hearts of millions of people, each scream louder than the next. What movie is this? Why, Psycho, of course.

It begins with a swift opening credit sequence that is low-tech but does the job. Just like the rest of the movie. This, along with other Hitchcock films, is what horror movies are. You don't need excessive blood and gore and amorous teenagers. All you need is a decent story and tension galore.

Actually, this landmark films is pretty much thrill-free for the first half. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary. She is asked to take $40,000 to the bank, but instead she runs away with it, without telling anybody. She then decides to check into the Bates Motel and chats a bit with loner owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She then takes a shower.

Everybody knows the plot, everyone knows the shower scene. What most people also know is how great this film is. It's finely crafted with superior music and terrific acting all around, with some symbolism all around. First, the music.

Bernard Herrmann, who produced the score for most of Hitch's other movies, did a top-notch job here, also. His strings orchestra really brought out the noir-ish mood. Even when Marion is just driving, you still feel tense because of his A+ score. The superimposed voice-overs that weren't very frequent were also quite good; it seemed like you couldn't tell whether Marion was thinking that or not. Hitchcock is a great directory; his camera shots and precise timing are superb. Most horror filmmakers try to carbon copy his style, but never succeed, because they don't have any of his wit and superiority. This is a fine craftsman at work.

Perkins is eerily great. He manages to be vague and yet vulnerable. He's being overpowered by his overbearing mother who lives in the house behind the motel. He seems like he could be a nice guyuntil he snaps. Leigh is also great, along with Vera Miles (Marion's sister Lila), John Gavin (Marion's boyfriend Sam), and Martin Balsam (P.I. Arborgast).

I don't understand why Psycho was remade thirty eight years after it came out. Nobody needed to see it in color, with new actors, and the same scene-by-scene! It probably would have been a lot better if Gus Van Sant (who directed the new one) did a `reimagining', like Tim Burton and Planet of the Apes. Sure, William H. Macy is in the new one, but I've seen some of it and it's just horrible.

Reading up online, I see some symbolism throughout the movie. Norman's obsession with birds (his middle name is Francis in the movie) means he wants to fly away from his mother. Something that I always love in movie is when they put `hints' of the movie in. For example, in the office where Marion works, there are two pictures: one of where she will be pulled over by a cop and one of a swamp that comes into play later. That type of stuff I always find fascinating.

Look for Hitchcock's cameo (like he always has) as a man in a cowboy hat around four minutes into the movie, outside of Marion's office.

My rating: 10/10

Rated R for two scenes of violence.",10
21 November 2019,Very good,"I liked this critique of Rotten Tomatoes: Infamous for its shower scene, but immortal for its contribution to the horror genre. Because Psychosis was filmed with tact, grace and art, Hitchcock not only created modern horror, he validated it.

30 May 2016,"Top, top cinema","This is one of the best horror films you'll watch in your life, and no this review is not just another band-wagon follower. This movie isn't overrated and its reputation isn't exaggerated. It truly is excellence if you've ever seen it on the silver screen. The utilization of the protagonists is unique and makes for a standout dynamic in this film, while at the end the twist is truly completely unexpected. And I'm saying this now at a time when we've seen it all in every possible way, so at the time this was just light-years ahead of its cinematic period all things considered. All actors play their part just fine and help establish at each moment, along with the excellent cinematography (all in subtlety and allusion) and soundtrack, a particular feel, or a specific lingering emotion. It's really very well done, and some parts are just spot-on like it is rare in film. But Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates just steals the show here amongst the cast. In this film, there is an unsettling weirdness that oozes out of him, and it is never overdone, nor is it ever unremarkable. It's just...just right. Moreover, the plot revolves around a fairly common, and very real occurrence: the Oedipus complex. And it's so well carried out throughout the film, and never gives in to over-exaggeration although it would remain of course a very extreme case. But never does this turn into overdramatic cheesy 60's horror cinema, and the tensions are handled perfectly, as always with Hitchcock, cleverly and meticulously. The only criticism I would give this is the too obvious explanation at the end and overall that ultimate elaboration scene just isn't realistic, in regards to a few things. Finally, the very last scene with Norman Bates' inner-monologue, and the way Perkins acts it out, and that smile. Just ...perfect.",9
13 August 2006,Quite simply my favourite horror film which still manages to scare me!,"Psycho, ever since I first saw it, has stuck with me. It is my favourite horror film and I can confidently say it always will be. Nothing comes close to the sheer thrills and chills Psycho delivers. From Hitchcock's masterful direction to Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins' flawless performances to Bernard Herrmann's unforgettable score, Psycho is the ultimate in real horror.

Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her employer's client and leaves town intent on starting afresh. While on the run she stops by Bate's Motel where she meets the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). They dine and converse for awhile then she returns to her hotel to get ready for bed and make amends for her crime. However, she takes a shower before this during which she is brutally stabbed to death by an unseen assailant. Her absence does not go unnoticed, as her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), and her sister Lila (Vera Miles) begin to question her whereabouts. Also hot on her trail is Detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam).

Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho traded the supernatural beings of the genre's past (vampires, werewolves and zombies) for a human monster. The film made Norman Bates a household name in the world of horror and movie villains. Hitchcock does not rely on cheap, hokey scares to terrify his audience, but uses various camera angles and tracking shots to heighten the tension and then, accompanied by Herrmann's shrieking score, lets lose a shocking image. Hitchcock is quite simply, as his common title suggests, the Master of Suspense. He knows how to tap into the movie-viewing public's collective psyche: By making his monster seemingly normal and by blending sex, madness and murder in a sordid tale.

The cast is spot on: Janet Leigh, in one of her more famous roles, is the naïve ""leading lady"" who meets her demise in the now infamous shower scene. Anthony Perkins gives a chilling performance as Norman Bates, his deceptive normality which masks his madness could not have been more convincingly done. Vera Miles and John Gavin provide excellent support in the last half, they both had great on-screen chemistry! Herrmann's famous score is arguably the best of any horror movie (it has been parodied and imitated countless times) and Hitchcock's direction is flawless (just look at the ending, which still shocks me to this day)! 5/5",10
13 October 2006,Now enjoyable on multiple levels,"I recently saw this classic again - unexpectedly - at a friend's home. One of the people visiting mentioned she'd never seen it, so he popped-in a tape and we all enjoyed it again.

It now presents not only the same ""classic"" genius of a great director's most famous work - but with the decades since it was made provides an historic view of the ""noir"" genre, and stars of the past in their more youthful days.

This was perfect for Tony Perkins. His constant twitches, peculiar mannerisms and demeanor, and always somewhat weird persona, were perfect for Norman. Janet Leigh was beautiful to view, even in this key. but necessarily shortened. role.

Although the two sequels, and another ""prequel,"" never equaled this original (no surprise), I couldn't help but run them through my mind as I watched the original again.

I also remembered one professional reviewer's subsequent humorous comment (I believe for Psycho III), remarking that (after therapy) ""Norman's doing better, but 'Mother' isn't doing so well.""",10
28 May 2011,The sex,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9

21 June 2006,The greatest horror movie ever!,"Marion Crane ( Janet Leigh) is a working woman in Phoenix Arizona who just took away some very important money from her boss and runs away to a motel owned by a strange man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins)who owns the motel and lives in a nearby house with his bizarre mother. She meets her final fate over there at the motel, investigations start occurring on some mysterious murders happening at the motel and to see who might be the murderer.

This just happens to be the mother of all horror movies in my humble opinion and it's also one of the all-time great movies! Alfred Hitchcock has brought the book from Robert Bloch to the big screen and turned it into one of the scariest and most suspenseful movies to ever hit the screen since it debuted in 1960 making audiences aware when taking showers. The shower scene is one of cinema's most terrifying and unforgettable moments with incredible tension that makes the viewers feel for the characters, the score by Bernard Herrman is total classic for sure and the movie went on to become an important landmark for the horror/thriller genre for years to come.

It's often imitated and rip-offed a lot of times and paved the way for slasher flicks since then but nothing can ever come this much close to the original masterpiece that started it all!",10
16 July 1999,"Psycho, The most overrated horror.. NO suspense movie of all time.","Well, what can I say about this film. It's merely okay and the black and white makes the film seem completely dull and frankly quite boring. I don't understand what all this talk about the color being artistic but I found it repulsive. The acting in the movie was very mediocre, especially from the stiff John Gavin, the ever so proper Vera Miles, and the so serious Martin Balsam. Try watching the new Psycho and you'll find that these characters can actually have personalities. As for Janet Leigh, well she was good, but Anne Heche seemed more innocent, more human, and more sympathetic. As for Anthony Perkins, he's also so monotone, barely ANY emotion, and I struggle to understand why people rave over his dry performance. As for the ""mother twist"", well that was good but there are twists in about every horror film now a days and they are usually more entertaining than this joke. And then there is the shower scene which everyone says is so scary? Where have they been , I could pick out a dream sequence from any A Nightmare on Elm Street sequel that was done more creatively and powerfully. It was a simple knifing in the shower for god's sake, isn't watching the opening of Drew Barrymore in Scream ten times more chilling and exciting? Give me a break, when I went to Universal Studious they said the shower sequence was one of the most famous scenes of all time. Well, give an audience an opportunity to watch either that or the astonishing death of Piper Laurie in Depalma's Carrie, or the thrill of the finale chase in Halloween, and well see what brings more reactionary emotion of the audience. Well, what can I say about a movie that I will never understand? When people made the new Psycho some thought it was stupid because of the story--and so I know I'm not alone. It's just that these old foggies are so hung up on old movies that they are blind to see that modern movies provide for much more entertainment. Some old horror films like Rosemary's Baby are excellent, but this is not. As for Bernard Herrmann score, it's overplayed, can't he think of anything new to compose? Compare Pino Donnagio' lush score from Carrie opposed to this and see what's more creative and effective. What can I say besides people, this movie is simply average and that it might of have been good back then, but it's simply OK now. Do we still rave about the type writer just because it was original back then? I have spoken and I guess that Blockbuster Video agrees with me that the movie is too much of a joke to be placed in the horror section. It's in the Drama suspense category, and certainly a thrilless and dated film to belong anywhere else. Psycho remains as the most overrated film of all time and the new Psycho is a much better improvement.",1

17 June 2020,What stays in your head is frightening than in your heart.,"What worked:
screenplay; I am surprised and amazed by the storytelling and dialogues. They are so crisp, engaging and keeps you focused. The movie is well directed, acted and works overall. The movie starts strong and ends strong, which is complementary.
What did not work:
technical aspect; of course if the movie was made with the technology of today, the thrills and horror would be intensified. Nonetheless, it's still a good thriller.
Final verdict: Recommended; at least to see the concept

16 November 2020,Anthony Perkins: Robbed of Recognition,"There's something rather fitting about the first Alfred Hitchcock film I've seen being one of his most famous. Unfortunately, thanks to pop culture having referenced the now famous shower scene in Psycho, I was already aware of the 'twist' early in the film that shocked audiences of the day, so a fair bit of the impact that Hitchcock had intended to create is lost on me. It is a shame that I can't experience this fantastic film with fresh eyes from 1960, but I would love to have the opportunity. However, the film's score is extremely effective at being unnerving and distinct from almost any other movie I've seen. Using only string instruments as a budget restraint proved to be beneficial to the tone of the movie. The same reasoning also applies to the decision to film in black and white, which may be a point against it to some people, but not me. Also impressive was Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates. He truly gives off the impression of a man completely unhinged, from his occasional stuttering, to the numerous physical things he does like the subtle twitching, and the completely deranged expressions he puts on. I can imagine why he reprised his role for every subsequent Psycho sequel movie, even though I haven't seen them. Definitely worth a watch today, even if some of the more intense moments may have lost their impact over the course of time.",10
14 March 2013,Probably Hitchcock's best,"Unlike most of Hitchcock's movies, everything in Psycho is excellent.

The script is consistent, coherent and captivating from start to finish. The actors are very convincing, special mention to Anthony Perkins who delivered a brilliant performance. Finally, the direction and mise-en-scène are of a high level as always, with great attention given to details.

But the most surprising thing is the two distinctive parts. The plot and main character defined at the beginning of the movie aren't the same at the end, because after about 30 minutes, the script takes a big turn, for the viewer's delight. How could one have anticipated such a twist so early in the movie and that shift in the story ? This is probably the best aspect of Psycho.

If there were any reproach to make, it would be about the lack of realism of the murders, especially the shower scene which incomprehensibly remained the token of the movie.

But it's minimal and Psycho remains probably the most accomplished feature of Hitchcock.",9
27 May 2008,A pretty good damn movie,"Everybody knows the famous score; everybody knows the villain and most people know what kind of man Norman Bates is like.

Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" starts off with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who robs a sum of forty-thousand dollars before driving through the California state with almost being caught by her boss and the employer she robbed the money from to the cop that pulls her over. Marion then wonders more into the state where during her departure not only does she get a new car to be incognito but stays at the Bates Motel where Norman Bates comes out and sees that she's by herself and needs company. To Marion, she thinks Norman is just a nice guy until the voices from the house start to ring where maybe something isn't right after all.

And that's where it all begins.

I love Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" as a thriller, but I don't get why people are calling it a great horror movie just because of the shower scene and Norman dressing like his mother. I think of Psycho as a crime/thriller/drama film where people need to understand that Marion committed a crime of stealing the money and after her death in the film, her disappearance along with the money is still involved when the detective starts questioning those involved with Marion about her whereabouts.

This is the only Hitchcock movie where I can't keep my eyes off for one damn minute.",9
10 September 2020,Name says it all,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament.

At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
5 September 2020,An Absolute Classic,"Finally, 60 years after its initial release, I got around to seeing Psycho after hearing references all the time and, of course, seeing the shower scene pop up in every compilation of greatest horror moments, or in essays and other writings about the genre. Ultimately, it's deserving of its iconic status: this is a truly fantastic film.

In terms of personal preference, I don't like this one quite as much as Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist, which are at the absolute top my list, but this film is worthy of its praise. It was ahead of its time, showing the audience things that had never been shown before (the first flushing toilet in American cinema, for example), it portrayed things that were taboo and often not discussed by the ""polite"" society of the time, and it is perhaps the greatest use of a musical score in history. That grating, screeching music is burned into the collective conscience of society, to the point of some people thinking of that score every single time they step into a shower.

Anthony Perkins is a fantastic Norman Bates. There's no question about that. Having just seen the original for the first time, I'm interested to see how he expands and develops the character in subsequent instalments, because there's definitely a lot of potential there.

And, of course, we have Janet Leigh, my personal favorite part of the entire film. Mother to Jamie Lee Curtis, Leigh earned the ""iconic horror badass"" crown just 18 years before her daughter would go on to do the very same thing in ""Halloween."" Janet's character isn't the traditional stupid character that ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time; she makes some bad decisions, but she's intelligent about the way she handles things, which is really nice for a change. Of course, without spoilers (if you don't know by now, you must be new to the genre), Janet is the face of that iconic shower scene, and it truly is one of the best scenes in classic horror history. It's not particularly graphic (dealing with censors back in the day had to have been an absolute NIGHTMARE), but it effectively finds that ""sweet spot"" between showing the audience what they want and pleasing the powers that be.

A lot of time has passed since Psycho first came out, but the passing of time hasn't tamed this beast. It's inevitable to view the film a little differently in the light of present day, but it still has the power to raise the hairs on the back of your neck 60 years later. While the shock might not have the same effect, the emotion that it's able to create in the viewer makes this one a guaranteed success.",7
4 May 2003,Hitch's best,"With so many great films, how can we pick Hitch's best? For me, this is it. The Victorian house, the b&w, all of Hitch's convoluted personality conflicts and dualities all rolled into his most direct masterpiece, plus Bernard Hermann, so good for so long, has never been as effective as he was here. Many other good films to be sure, such as Vertigo, N/NW, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt, The Man Who Knew Too Much (34), 39 Steps, Frenzy, but this one has the most impact for me. Vertigo is a close second, very close.

22 June 2000,A horror-classic,"Psycho is one of the best and most popular horror-movies. Psycho can still scary you, even after 40 years. Norman Bates owns a Motel, and a series of strange things happen there. I borrowed this from my local library, not expecting much from it, but I ended up being rather impressed by it. 9/10

1 September 2017,Not so horrifying,"To be honest, the movie is not that horrifying. The famous shower scene is bloody but not scary. The scene that the corpse of Norman's mother is discovered is more terrifying. Overall speaking, without supernatural things typically existed in a horror movie, ""Psycho"" is not so horrifying.

It is not mysterious as well, since it is not hard to guess that Norman kills Marion. The movie is just an quintessential Hitchcock thriller. The climax lies in the last twenty minutes, during which the audience will hold their breath and keep wondering what happen next.

Anthony Perkins performs extremely well in the movie. His tone of speaking is a little like that of Andrew Garfield.

10 September 2020,CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED MASTERPIECE....!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine.

23 September 2013,Hitchcock Exceeds Anything He's Ever Done,"Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness.

Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career.

Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower.

The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters.

The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal.

Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself ""Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife"", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene.

Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film.

Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience.

27 December 2000,A classic if there ever was one.,"As much as I like the 1998 remake it was very unnecessary in my opinion. Why remake something that is already perfected? Psycho is probably the best horror movie this world will ever see. I think the fact that it's in black and white actually adds to the suspense of it all. Most of the movies from the 60's have faded with time and aren't spoken of much anymore but psycho even before the remake is still very remembered, very fresh in our heads, and still held in the very highest respects. (and thats not the only one of Hitchcock's movies that is.) I will always love the famous shower scene and always think about when I'm home alone in the shower and hear a noise. Not every movie has a scene in it that can live in your head like that. One of the ideas in this movie that i particularly like is how Marion was going to go back and fix what she had done wrong in the morning but it was too late. No one would have ever known after that that she was sorry and she was going to bring the money back it just brings up and interesting point. I wish todays horror movies were this good.

The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
19 November 2019,A Horror Masterpiece,"I thought this movie was very well done for its time, especially as a horror movie. The lighting and music built up a tense atmosphere that I haven't really felt in recent horror films. The characters were played so well by their actors to the point that I didn't expect quite a number of things to happen. This film was made so well and it really is one of the best horror films ever made. I highly recommend this to any fans of the horror genre if they haven't seen it already.

7 September 2012,What a thriller...,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue"").

1 October 2023,10/10,"Psycho was a very original horror in 1960 when people were mostly scared by ghosts, aliens or monsters. But the real terror lied in people.

That's why it came as something new and refreshing; choosing a man as the villain for a horror-slasher was certainly a brave decision that was viewed dubiously by the film's producers. In fact, it worked out very well and the film was a massive success that put it straight to number 1 in the best horrors ever made.

There are 2 ways the movie can be perceived- as a psychological analysis of family trauma, the duality of the human being and the fight between good and evil, or as an intriguing tale of murder and mystery, pumping with adrenaline and suspense until the last few minutes. Psycho works best when it's about action and mystery, rather than characters and their psychologies.

Hitchcock is, indeed, the master of suspense and he proves it in almost every film he makes - terror and fear are in the air, but that's precisely because you have no idea what Norman Bates is going to do next - the moments when you don't know what he's thinking are the most successful because no logical explanation can suffice for his actions. That's why the final twist, along with the psychiatrist's presentation of events make you chuckle a little, the terror turns to some amusement and the story becomes a little unbelievable and exaggerated.

The ending is kind of laughable, but the rest of the movie is horror at its best.",10

16 May 2004,"One of, if not the...","One of, if not the most influential horror movies ever, with many plot devices which have now become clichés, and proving that Hitchcock was the master of all genres. The themes can be talked about over and over, but it is the build up of suspense, coupled with Perkins's performance which keeps it fresh today. Perhaps not jumpy enough for some, although there are plenty of those moments, the film relies on the director's knowledge of the viewer: we are in his hands. Probably my favourite scene-when Bates bursts out of an upstairs room, with the overhead shot. Deliberately gritty and bleak, and no pimply teens to be found...those were the days. 9 out of 10

10 September 2001,To make awful remakes from great originals is blasphemy!!!,"Along with George A. Romero´s ""Night of the living Dead"" ""Psycho"" is the most genre-defining film of modern horror. The ""shower scene"" is legendary and mastermind Alfred Hitchcock has done absolutely great work with using an expressionst style in making this movie. Main actor Anthony Perkins is giving an unforgettable over the top-performance! His role was so perfectly convincing that he was branded with the Norman Bates-image for his life time...

Recently I wrote a review about Robert Wise´s all-time classic ""The haunting"" and compared it to Jan de Bont´s terrible remake... Now, ""Psycho"" is a similar case: the suspense has gone, the creepy atmosphere is totally missing and Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates is one of the greatest miscasts in the history of cinema!!!

I always thought that the disgrace of monuments is punishable...

19 February 2000,not that good,"i feel this movie is way over rated, i mean don't get me wrong it's a classic, it started the horror genre. but was it really that good? i feel no it wasn't. the first 30 minutes are very slow, once Anthony Perkins enters the movie it gets better, but even then it's kind of slow. but it is very suspenseful, the reason it's so popular is cause, it's the first real horror movie. and Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job directing this movie the shower scene just might be the greatest shot ever. i feel that Halloween blows this movie away big time, though if you like suspense rent psycho. and you might get a scare or two i give psycho 6/10.

26 May 2003,"good direction, paved the way for modern slashers, low production values","This is a well directed and extremely well-scored movie. Unfortunately, while the movie is interesting for its place in cinematic history, (just look at the accelerated editing in the shower scene) it really isn't at all scary, or even all that interesting today. The production values for the movie are amazingly low, and it often shows (it was filmed on the cheap on a hitchcock presents TV lot). The script is weak and reeks of an exploitation film. The acting is good, though not great. Bad material handled by a great director that's worth watching if youre interested in cinema or too old to enjoy a gory, though better film. If you're looking for the zenith of this genre look elsewhere (ie: Halloween). If you're looking for the pioneer, this is it.

6 July 2020,The Advent of Modern Horror,"Being hailed as the film which gave rise to the Golden Age of Slasher in the decades that followed and the impetus which revolutionized the horror genre to what it is known as in today's modern world, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho still remains a timeless classic.

Though having been released more than half a century ago, this psychoanalytical thriller makes brilliant use of a variety of recurring themes, parallelisms and motifs all throughout the film, adding more depth to the experience of watching and analyzing it,-a quality which I greatly appreciate in any film-giving the audience more incentive to give the film the honor of receiving another viewing pleasure.

Overall, it is not only the underlying themes and the clever use of cinematography which make Psycho a film staple in my eyes, not only the iconic score provided by Bernard Hermann or the daring decisions which the director decided upon when releasing this type of film in the 1960s, but also its lasting contribution to the genre itself, serving as the mold which shaped horror cinema to its current state.",10

10 February 2013,Masterful...,"A truly excellent piece of filmmaking; yes, it's a bit 'wordy' in places, but that was the style back then. There are equally many scenes in which there is no dialogue at all and these are even better in my book. Hitchcock knew just how much to show the audience to intrigue them and I so wish there were more filmmakers around today who were as adept as he was. The performances were all excellent; particularly Janet Leigh as the conflicted felon and Anthony Perkins as the mentally tortured motel owner. The only thing I felt let it down was the very long explanation towards the end; where every nuance of the condition afflicting Bates is exposed. I didn't feel that much detail was needed; but I could be nit-picking a bit here. It's a great piece of filmmaking and one every fan of the movies should see at least once.

SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

My score: 9.4/10.

14 April 2021,Psycho,"Inside every tough guy there's a little psycho, and inside every psycho there's a teensy weensy mother just waiting to jump out with a knife in her cold, dead hand. So director Al Hitchcock would have us believe after watching his original psycho drama of 1960.

Born in London (Leytonstone), Al began in Silents, first directing rom drams, then suspense (The-Lady-Vanishes The-39-Steps). Like many proven English makers, he'd cross the Pond, then the North American continent to the USA's movie mecca, Hollywood, expanding his repertoire on makes like Mr-&-Mrs-Smith Rear-Window Rebecca Saboteur and Strangers-On-A-Train, eventually focusing his energies on one genre. And of his vast catalog, two films stand out, cementing his place atop the hierarchy of horror directors: Psycho (60) and The-Birds (63), both ingenious tales set in eerily everyday circumstance, the latter airing on 70s TV with frequency (What's a little eye gauging and tortious bird behavior, anyway, right?), and Psycho, with its famous chef salad shower scene and weird mother-son dynamic, proving too graphic for censors who sometimes DID know best. But with cable's arrival (80s) and codes liberated, all of us finally got to check-in the Bates Motel, assuming all risks and liabilities appurtenant (gulp).

Some earlier films crossed the line: Born-to-Kill (47) & Powell's neglected masterwork, Peeping-Tom (60), also featuring a lead whose creative, kindly nature masks a parent-fostered, demonic psychosis, released in the UK two months prior (Ap 60), yet, its US distribution delayed (11-61) when usual partner in horror proliferation, A-I-P, oddly took a pass, allowing Paramount's picture to make the first, indelible mark on minds of American movie-goers. Even so, Psycho did distinguish itself. Innovations in technical arts created shocking sights & sounds that would change movies forever. How censors ever let it show in theaters is a small miracle, or deal made with the devil.

Anthony Perkins stars as the charming but demented desk clerk Norman Bates in the role that made him as legendary as Hitchcock, with Janet Leigh cast the comely check-in who jumps from criminal frying-pan ($$ >> APB) into the victim's fire, learning the hardest way possible that 'Crime never pays!' Other contributors: writers Joe Stefano (s/p) & Bob Bloch (b), cinematographer John Russell (his frame and pull-back from the eye of a corpse is exquisite), music man Bernard Hermann & sound specialist William Russell (the piercing note that powers the shower scene may be the most famous single tone in all of cinema), costumer Rita Riggs, set designer George Milo, special effects by Clarence Champagne and highly under-rated editor, George Tomasini (Rear-Window Stalag-17 Vertigo The-Misfits The-Birds The-Time-Machine).

Missed the mark: 1) At first meet, Norman is too normal for what lay ahead, his ""mother"" and ""madness"" mentions a little too cute; 2) John Gavin's Sam is almost as weird as Norman, his attempts to fluster Bates enough to get the boyfriend tossed on his ear anywhere else, but then Loomis has his uses, and 3) I could've done without the last five minutes of psycho-splaining from the good doctor (Oakland) in preparation for Bates' legal defense (incompetence in Arizona), and yet, still a masterpiece (4/4).",9
16 July 2017,Classic horror film,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8

3 February 2007,Chilling and totally unpredictable,"This is rightly considered Hitchcock's greatest film. The black and white cinematography, combined with low key lighting in most of the (indoor)scenes, gives the story a mysterious look which is reminiscent of the film noir genre of the 1940s. The film score is at its most powerful in Marion's driving-in-the-rain scene and in the famous shower scene. Anthony Perkins is really perfect as the psychotic killer, having just the right combination of rage, vulnerability, fear, and compulsion. The finale, where the psychologist explains the character of Norman Bates,completes the film very well. All in all, one of the greatest films ever made.

21 October 2013,"An Excellent,Scary And Landmark Horror Masterpiece And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. Alfred Hitchcock At His Best.","Psycho is an excellent,scary and landmark Horror Masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made that is filled with amazing direction,a terrific cast,a fantastic script and a masterful score. All of those combinations make Psycho not only a masterpiece of Horror cinema,but also a masterpiece of cinema in general and is Alfred Hitchcock at his very best.

Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch,Psycho tells the story of Marion Crave(Janet Leigh),a real estate office secretary that has been given 40,000$ in cash to take to the bank but when Marion doesn't do so,Marion takes the money and goes on the run. Scared and tired,Marion decides to stop at a Motel ran by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins),a young man that runs the Motel and takes care of his Mother. The stay at the Motel leads to horrific and strange turn of events.

What can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho that hasn't been said before? The film is a flawless Masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest,scariest and most iconic movies of all time and is the first modern Horror movie that changed the Horror genre as we know it. Prior to Psycho,Horror movies from the 1930s to the 1950s had been done by Universal Films and Hammer Pictures and Horror films mostly dealt with monsters like Zombies,Vampires,Werewolves and creatures from outer space or were set in the 18th or 19th century in castles. But then in 1960 Psycho came out and changed Horror films forever and brought Horror into the modern world and gave viewers a different kind of monster which was a human being and Psycho would set the standard for Horror and Suspense Thrillers that came after Psycho and despite Hitchcock giving cinema many classics and Masterpieces Psycho is Hitchcock's most famous and iconic film. Psycho is a great film that right from the very beginning the movie pulls you into a frightening and terrifying nightmare that is relentless and powerful like a tightrope with white hot suspense that never stops until the very end. Psycho is also a great film because it gave audiences a new and different kind of Horror film that breaks all of the rules and conventions that are associated with Horror and Hollywood films with Hitchcock make people think the film is going to go one way when it goes another and the film gives you a sense of dread and offers no salvation or happiness. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Psycho are done with great timing and much detail and when the scary scenes happen they hit you like an unexpected punch in the face and your heart will be racing because with each scary and suspenseful scene Hitchcock is frightening you not only physically but mentally as well. The style and brilliance of Psycho would influence Horror films and Thrillers that came out years after Psycho's release. Probably the scariest and most suspenseful scene in the film is the famous shower scene,a classic and iconic scene that Hitchcock filmed with such a masterful stroke using clever camera angles and tricks making you watch in awe and terror. It's a scene you will never forget and will change the way you take showers forever. While the film is scary,Psycho wouldn't be as nearly scary without the atmosphere. During the 1950s,Alfred Hitchcock had filmed his movies in color but with Psycho Hitchcock filmed this movie in Black & White thanks to Jack L. Russell's beautiful and visually stunning photography which gives the movie a dark and beautiful Film Noir look that is harsh and bleak almost like you're in a living nightmare. The main characters in Psycho are wonderful because they are not Horror movie stereotypes or Cartoons but real people that viewers will relate to because of the horrific and dangerous situations that happen in the film. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano is amazing and memorable,with Stefano giving the main characters dialog that is tight and incredible. The ending of Psycho is amazing,scary and is an ending you won't expect or see coming. The ending of Psycho is twisted and shocking and is one of the things that makes Psycho a masterpiece.

The whole cast is great. Anthony Perkins is excellent and iconic as Norman Bates,with Perkins bringing intensity and power to the role. Janet Leigh is brilliant in her most famous and iconic role as Marion Crane,with Leigh bringing depth and class to the role. Vera Miles is terrific as Lila Crane,Marion's sister. John Galvin is wonderful as Sam Loomis,Marion's boyfriend. Martin Balsam is fantastic as Milton Arbogast,a private detective. John McIntire(Sheriff Al Chambers),Simon Oakland(Dr. Fred Richman),Lurene Tuttle(Mrs. Chambers),Frank Albertson(Tom Cassidy),Patrica Hitchcock(Caroline),Vaughn Taylor(George Lower),John Anderson(California Charlie)and Mort Mills(Highway Patrol Officer)give good performances as well.

The direction by Alfred Hitchcock is excellent and stylish,with Hitchcock constantly moving the camera and using amazing angles giving the film a great visual style and tone while doing a terrific job with the scary and suspenseful scenes. Masterful direction by Hitchcock.

The score by Bernard Herrmann is brilliant,scary,intense and one of the greatest and most iconic scores in movie history and it truly matches the film's dark and frightening tone. Terrific score by Herrmann.

In final word,if you love Alfred Hitchcock,Horror films or movies in general,I highly suggest you see Psycho,an excellent,scary landmark Horror Masterpiece,one of the greatest films ever made that you can watch again and again and is Alfred Hitchcock at his best.",10
30 October 2013,Excellent,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
16 December 2010,One of the Greatest of all Time,"I have only recently saw this movie and before I seen it, I have to admit I was very sceptical. Though, I was very wrong, this has turned out to be one of my favourites movies of all time.

I was told by many that it was a very scary experience though I personally do not find it that ""scary"" I find it more creepy than anything, Anthony Perkins performance as Norman Bates is phenomenal the acting he delivers is incredible, every time he spoke I had a chill run down the back of my spine.

The other performances throughout the movie, are great as well not as good as Anthony but still great. The script was also fantastic, and the camera angles were also perfect there were no over the top moments, they were just right. And finally, the soundtrack to this movie was amazing.

Though there are a couple of complaints I have got and one of them is that there is a couple of scenes which were totally pointless and some of the effects were quite, how shall I put it, 'shabby'.

Overall though this is one of my new favourites I would have to give this a 10/10. Though I still do like The Shining just a little bit more.",9
21 April 2020,On the Misleading of Details,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament.

14 August 2021,Didn't age too well but still worth watching,"Surely Hitch took his time to introduce the main character here.

""Psycho"" has been quoted, remade, and parodied so many times that it lost a lot of its punch, but is still an entertaining film to watch. Historical value aside, the first half is a superb example of fine storytelling, and Anthony Perkins's performance is so natural that it makes me shiver every time. I like how the film makes such a big deal about Marion and the 40,000 dollars only to completely shift the focus halfway through. The second half gets kind of spoiled by Vera Miles' stiff performance but also offers an interesting twist. Nothing exceptional in 2020, but at that time it must have been something groundbreaking, as Hitchcock had to hire Simon Oakland just to explain the film at the end.

19 May 2010,Mundane Freudian Horror from This World,"At the age of 60, Alfred Hitchcock decided to go wildly radical after his award-winning big productions. His next film, Psycho (1960), was an independent production whose budget was only 800 000 dollars. Through this Hitchcock was able to make a film, entirely in a way he wanted to but also achieve a naturally mundane atmosphere which was still characterized by psychological and film noir-like elements. Psycho is still Hitchcock's most shocking film and the most influential film he ever made. Just like The Beatles, the death of Elvis and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so is Psycho a part of the cultural legacy of the 1960's. It marked a turning point in the history of American cinema and changed its being forever: reality was now approached in a brand new way, through a Hitchcockian prism of fear.

In the central of Psycho there is a run-down motel which has been left to the side of a new highway: a picture of alienation, a system which progresses quickly, neglecting the actual needs of people. The motel is run by an extraordinary man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives alone with his mother. One day Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a woman who has just stolen 40, 000 dollars, arrives to the Bates' Motel. Having disappeared, Marion's boyfriend and sister start to look for her. But Norman isn't too happy about it and tries to avoid their investigation.

Like in many films by Alfred Hitchcock, the opening credits of Psycho are extremely important and fascinating. These opening credits were designed by the storyboard artist and pictorial consultant Saul Bass, who had also designed them for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). The credits, together with the score by Bernard Herrmann, manage to set out the theme and the topic of the film. The credits are often seen to illustrate the decomposition of the human mind but also the change of order and disorder which is common for capitalist urban life. It is an expression of the ""new"" world order.

The graphics designed by Bass don't just reign the opening credits: they're everywhere in the film. In the beginning, we see the horizontal Janet Leigh and her brassiere, and the vertical John Gavin, completely topless. The geometric polarity of horizontal and vertical lines repeats in concrete forms throughout Psycho: for example, the horizontal motel and the vertical Victorian mansion in which Norman's mother lives.

Psycho is mundane, or as Michael Schmidt has said ""Psycho combines wonderfully the everyday and mysterious."" But it really isn't a b-movie. For Hitchcock the horror and excitement just happen to arise from ordinary, mundane things. Once again, the opening scene is a wonderful example of this: just a conventional, simple scene. Back then, the audience was affected by Janet Leigh's breasts and brassiere which were shown for the first time in the history of cinema but, what is more, the scene is so well filmed that the viewer can do nothing but get identified with the characters. Psycho indeed might just be the most polished thriller ever made. It's perfect, no matter how you look at it.

Psycho puts the society to a collision between the shadows of past and presence. It conducted dialog between the old past and trendy presence. In the film, we meet two modern urban clichés: a regular office girl and a lonely youngster who also spends most of his time at his office. There is one intriguing scene which is a wonderful example of this: an unconventional love scene between two loners which, in turn, conducts dialog with the opening scene: now the characters don't talk about money and sex but about loneliness.

The way I see it, if Psycho has got a thesis, it must be that fear is in ourselves. Marion is constantly put in scenes with mirrors: first in the office, then in the motel etc. The most luminous proof of the nature of this thesis is in the scene where Marion's sister (Vera Miles) scares her own reflection on a mirror -- a brilliant shot which soon became a cliché.

In Psycho money isn't really essential. Money is present, all the time, but it doesn't make a difference -- it is insignificant. Hitchcock obviously wanted to show money just as a part of the society. It is a part of the air we breathe, so to speak. However, Psycho does also talk more widely about consumer society. A good example of the consumer culture is the scene where Marion quickly changes her old car to a new one. Even if her motive was to get away from the cops, the scene doesn't just talk about her personal hurry but about the social hurry inside us all. Psycho talks about the American society and about the transition, in the 1950's: how it turned from the conservative to more and more liberal in the 1960's but at the same became more alienated and anguished.

I'm sure I could go on and on about Psycho but, unfortunately, there are limitations. To put it briefly, Psycho is one of the best American films ever made and its aesthetic, cultural and sociological influence is undeniable. Many have spent thousands of words just talking about the architecture of Psycho: how the mansion represents the Freudian psychic apparatus (id, ego and superego) and how much influence Hitchcock took from an American painter Edward Hopper (take a look at The House by the Railroad). Together with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960), Hitchcock's Psycho opened the gates for the graphically clear treatment for violence. However, it is much more of a film about our world than violence. Psycho is all about an example of voyeurism and alienation but, in reality, the criticism hits the whole perverted culture and society. Its mundane, Freudian horror is straight from this world and those who criticize it for being horrible, actually criticize their own existence and twisted world.",10
28 November 1998,What do I think of the movie Psycho(1960)?,"I saw this movie one day and I really liked it a lot. It became my favorite movie. After I saw this movie I started to like other horror movies. I think that Psycho is the best movie that was ever made. I will always like the original better than the remake that is coming out on December 4.

30 July 2003,The best movie ever made?,"This is possibly the most brilliant movie ever made. Both technically and in terms of theme. I cannot even begin to praise it. Hitchcock is obviously the last true cinematic genious. Genuinely ghostly this movie will haunt us for ever. Deserves to be among the greatest artworks of the 20th Century.

22 March 2001,Terrible,"I've always thought of Psycho as a masterpiece of classic horror, one that makes you cringe and sparks true fear, especially when pulling the shower curtain across, leaving you exposed, naked to monstrosities lurking on the other side: and that was before I'd even seen it. Now that I have seen it....I believe that Hitchcock is the most overrated director of all time. With the exception of the the shower scene which is effective in the same way Blair Witch was, it preys on basic human emotions, this one being vulnerability. I mean, what could be more vulnerable that a naked woman in a shower in a strange hotel, a woman who's sinned and you know is ""gonna get it"" anyway? The only surprise is the short amount off time it takes to discard the leading lady. In that sense, it is a true shock.... but with that exception what does Psycho really have. Nothing. And I have proof. Consider the new adaptation of Psycho by Gus van Zant. It bombed at the theaters and was slayed by critics, even though Zant's version is identical in almost every way. And these are the same critics who call the original Psycho a masterpiece. Their only critique should have been on the acting or the photography, but alot of them attacked pacing and story line, even though they were the same. It's the memory of a scary film that you saw when you were young that won't let you destroy the illusion. Well an illusion is all it is. Rear Window and North by Northwest are boring films speckled with a few exciting moments, nothing more and so is Psycho. I feel the same way about Toxic Avenger. When I was 5, I thought it was fantastic, best movie ever-then I saw it again a year ago and it was filth, complete garbage but at least I let go of the memory of the film and concentrated on the film itself. Some of those Hitchcock fans ought to do the same....",
23 May 2018,My favorite Hitchcock movie,"No list of favorite movies is complete without something from Alfred Hitchcock. I keep changing my mind on my favorite of his. Vertigo was one for a while, then I switched to Strangers on a Train, but the pieces add up best in Psycho. If someone has never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie and would like to know why he's so important to cinema, here's a perfect introduction. The music by Bernard Herrmann is one of the most famous songs in the history of music. The scenes are memorable both in what they're about and how they're filmed. The casting is pitch perfect. The story adds up all the way through. The trade marks of Hitchcock are everywhere in this, especially the ""twist ending"", which he invented and never fails to shock me when I watch the picture due to it's realism.

4 January 2006,Simply Chilling,"You've never experienced chilling until you watch PSYCHO. Alfred Hitchcock was and is the Master of Suspense. The shower scene is one of the most chilling and blood-stopping scenes of all time (especially for its day). However, the real reason the shower scene was so chilling is because of the music. The music is classic and extremely recognizable. Interesting fact: Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) was originally discouraged by friends and family about taking the role of Marion Crane, saying that because she died the role wouldn't be good for her. Well despite all that negative energy from family and friends, Janet took the role. Now that is her most famous role she ever played. As a matter of fact, few people can name any other film she WAS in besides PSYCHO.

If you like to be scared but don't like all the gore of many now-a-day horror-suspense films, then PSYCHO is a great Film.

Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
3 October 2006,Shower Scene Did It For Me,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

2 October 2012,Excellent psychological thriller,"That's my current favorite Hitchcock film. Its more of a terror film than a psychological thriller and this is the reason I like it: its the only Hitchcock film that has really managed to scare me. However, I do not consider a film such as this as ""a great film"", simply because I am not the greatest fan of such type of genre. Still, I admit it is a masterpiece of its genre and the fans of such films will certainly love this movie.

Also, given it is a very old film, it has some flaws given its obsolete pacing and structure. The story drags a little in the first half of the film and later it seems to be rushed through. Though in a sense this improves the final dramatic shock of the film. The ending is totally ""holy sh*t this is great!"", though I took off two points out of 10 because of its incomplete nature as a film.

30 September 2023,Overrated.,"I eventually got round to watching what is probably the most famous Hitchcock movie and I have to say it was a bit of a let down. While the story is obvious to anyone who hasn't been living as a hermit their entire life, I still should have been able to engage with this movie much better than I did. Its simply not in the same league as something like Rear Window.

While the movie does have a few great stand out scenes overall it doesn't have the same grip you come to expect from Hitch. The first act focuses on a woman who rips off her boss to the tune of 40 grand, she's also an adulterer so you obviously don't care for her, but then the movie does a 180 and focuses on Norman Bates. This is quite a jarring switch and seems a very odd choice in terms of narration. I would also argue that the conclusion is a huge let down. There is a minor action scene and then we are subjected to what I can only describe as a psychobabble explanation of why Norman is why he is. But unfortunately its complete nonsense, there is no such thing as a ""split personality"" and the psychiatrists speech is pure bunkum. Had they bothered to write a story about someone with an actual diagnosable DSM/ICD illness and write the story around that, then sure. But to basically invent a mental illness and have some pretend psychiatrist take up the final act talking nonsense is unforgivable. While I am sure it may impress some people who have no clue about mental health, the Norman Bates case is laughable to anyone who knows about mental health.

The pros of this movie are the cinematography and a couple of stand out scenes. The negatives are the entirely fictitious mental health issues and the ropey script. This isn't an 8.5 out of 10 movie, it's not even an 8.5 in terms of Hitchcock. Its a just above average thriller that is unlikely to shock or thrill the way it may have in the 60's.",6

25 April 2001,lock the door next time you take a shower,"I gave this movie a 10, not out of sheer unjudging infatuation of the movie or of Alfred Hitchcock. I gave this movie a 10 with a very clear and unbiased viewing. So believe me when I say: this movie is very best of its field. The scenes are amazing, everything must have been very intricately imagined by Hitchcock because everything had maximum effect. Mr. Hitchcock very brilliantly considered all aspects of the movie, even the fact that he had it shot in black and white meshes together so very well. The villaian is so believable you can almost taste his sweat and franticness. So are the victims, you can taste their pain. The murder scene in the shower is the BEST murder scene I have ever seen in my life. And believe me, I have seen loads of movies to choose from. The murder scene made Argento's murder scenes look like Sesame Street. There was an editing of a scene which showed nudity, many people complained about this but I salute the MPAA for cutting out the nudity scene. This movie is pure, it does not need even a flash of nudity. I want you all to understand one thing, recently they remade this movie with a newer cast, more money, color, etc. and they could still not come close to touching the power Psycho had. It is not just because it's a remake either, it's because something was completely missing. This movie is unbeatable in its field.",10
6 May 2021,Iconic and Hitchcocks best,"Hard to think of a more iconic film than Psycho so it's difficult to watch objectively. None the less it's a brilliant horror mystery with great performances and cinematography. Genuinely shocking and surprising at it's pivotal story moments. Having seen a number of Hitchcock films with quite similar male leads, Janet Leigh was a welcome change.

27 August 2006,Hitchcok's Masterpiece,"Psycho starts as a common ""black"" movie with our heroine Marion (Janet Leigh)stealing us$ 40.000 from his boss for sentimental reasons. Her run ends up at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman (Anthony Perkins) and his sick mother. All of a sudden she is smashed to death in the famous shower scene, no more than 40 minutes after that start. Then we realize we have entered in a completely different kind of movie: a sordid Thriller with a surprising ""finale"" much like a horror film. Hitchcock carries the picture perfectly and it makes complete sense at the end. Back in 1960 double personality movies where not common and many appeared after Psycho (Dressed to Kill, as the outstanding example),but none could get even close to the original. Interest is kept all along and the music score is perfect too. As for the cast, it could not be better. Leigh proved for the first time she could really act and did well after Psycho. Vera Miles also grew as an actress after Psycho, and John Gavin was correct (unusual in him). John McIntyre and Martin Balsam make great supporting. As for Perkins there can be no doubt this was his best performance ever; in fact, you could say the film ruined his carrier because whenever you saw him after Psycho you could not help see Norman Bates. But on the other side, the role put him forever in films history. Saying that Psycho is Hitchcok's best picture shows clearly the huge size of this movie coming from a guy that made such classics as Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, North by Northwest and many others. Without a ""shadow of a doubt"" Psycho is the best thriller ever made!",10
29 October 2007,Works because of the performances,"Reviewing Alfred Hitchcock's famed black and white opus Psycho from a 21st century perspective gives the film less credit than it deserves. For it's time, it was revolutionary. Now, it is just a well acted, yet somewhat dated horror film. The editing in the shower scene has become a cliché in pop culture, but one cannot deny the original brilliance of the scene. The movie really only works as well as it does because of the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Perkins never really had another role he was better in, save Mike Nichols' Catch-22, a personal favorite. After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.

Psycho also created the character of Dr. Sam Loomis, a name later used in the other revolutionary horror film, John Carpenter's Halloween. Overall, the movie doesn't age as horrible as some other select black and white 50's-60's horror films, but nevertheless it does age a reasonable amount, leading to many cringe worthy and laughable scenes, most likely due lackluster performances by the rest of the cast, low production values, and shady effects and ""skeletons.""",7

Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",
11 December 2002,"Musaeum Piece, unfortunately...","I really like this movie, I really like Hithcock and I really liked Psycho. But unfortunately Psycho, thanks to pop-culture references and Time, had degraded over the years into nothing more than a museaum piece. Unlike Vertigo, which needed time to ferment before being accepted, Psycho is now, like ""Beowolf"" or ""The Devine Comedy"" something that not all would find appealing.

It deserves the name ""Classic"" but it doesn't deserve the place as ""The No. 1 Most Suspensful Movie Ever Made.""

Sorry.

The music, on the other hand, is timeless...

11 June 2009,Norman Birds,"Anyone ever notice Perkins' bird-like performance? Look at the stuffed birds in the motel room. And the way he's eating like a nervous sparrow. In a movie (and a directorial career) full of impish inside jokes, Hitch turns Norman Bates into a frightened fledgling unable to escape momma's nest.

All in all, a gigantic and immensely well-made trick on the audience's expectations and the ""über""-mother of all the inferior slasher flicks that followed.

(Were it not for the silly final speech to explain Norman's behaviour away with psychological mumbo-jumbo, this would be a minor classic.)

17 November 2001,Don't go in the shower!,"What made me love this movie was Norman Bates. He seemed like a such a nice every-day type guy...that just so happens to be psychotic and stab people in their showers. Janet Leigh (who is a much better actress than her daughter) was a great choice for her character. On the other hand, I really hated the whiny girl they cast as her sister. What made psycho work as a thriller/ horror phenonemon was the way it was marketed..because, let's face it--the shower scene isn't THAT scary. The reason why its so memorable is because of the way it shocked people who didn't know what to expect. I mean if you watch the old trailers, it doesn't give away much. So Psycho really should go down in history as a classic.

29 July 2012,Best Horror Film Ever!!!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

27 October 2000,Not all It's Cracked up to be,"I watched Psycho for my Perspectives on Popular Culture, and I was not impressed at all by the shower scene. The one thing that was really intriguing was the character of Norman Bates, who would make an interesting study in probably any field. I guess what made me dislike Psycho is that I knew the plot ahead of time. I bet that if I saw this film in 1960 I would have enjoyed it a lot more. It reminded me a little of the Sixth Sense, another psychological thriller.

27 October 2011,The most potent and terrifying film of its era!,"Psycho defined a generation of filmmakers. It is a film of such power that some still worship it. The most potent movie of this time period and the scariest. It still remains one of the most effective films around. Perkins gives the best performance of his career as Bates, the villain of the century. Psycho scares us from the beginning and scares us at the end as well. It may be Hitchcock's scariest movie, if not his all-time best. The score is legendary, the filmmaking is powerful, and the acting is incredible. So many films have tried to replicate the suspense of this movie, but all have failed to match the sheer power of Hitchcock's groundbreaking horror fest.

9 July 2004,"""We all go a little mad sometimes, haven't you?""","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is one of my favorite films of all time and the best horror film I have ever seen. Hitchcock does a great job of telling a story with a film, not necessarily pointing everything out to viewer, but keeping the viewer on their toes the whole time. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is the heroine of the story who steals $40,000 of her boss's money and flees the city. Twists and turns abound as Marion is followed by a police officer for much of her trip neither her nor us knowing what he knows or why he finds her suspicious.

Eventually Marion meets up with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who runs a run-down hotel much like any you could find along any highway anywhere in the country. What follows is one of the most famous scenes and events in motion picture history. If you don't know yet, I won't ruin it for you.

Hitchcock is at his best messing with the audience's heads in this flick, in my opinion right up there with his stellar story in ""North by Northwest."" The film is a great thriller and a great horror film that takes you on a roller coaster throughout all the events that take place.

Not much can top ""Psycho"" and I'm not sure if there is anything that could be done to improve it. It is just that good.

10 November 2001,Forerunner of slasher flicks,"Minor spoliers.

I disgree with many Hitchcock fans in that I prefer his ""obvious"" creepy films such as this one and ""The Birds"" more than more sublte (and far less effective, and subsequently duller) works like ""Vertigo"". What a film such as ""Vertigo"" lacks that ""Psycho"" has is edginess. This is demonstrated adroitly in the ""parlor"" discussion between Norman and Marion which is penetrating and smart.

It would seem hackneyed to comment on the ""shower scene"", but the reason it is so demotic is because of its brillance. By exploiting the vulnerablity that is simply being in the shower he brings horror close to home. The shot from inside the shower where we see the blurry image appear on the other side of the curtain, is ominously fufilling.

Oh yeah--Janet Leigh is unbelievably sexy (pardon for a moment while I digress to my fellow males--ain't black bras great!). It's too bad that she had to leave at the film's middle, but then of course this movie would have never been what it is, huh?",
12 December 2015,My Favourite Movie Ever!,"Psycho is one of the very few films that I could say is perfect. It has no flaws what so ever and has some of the best performances in a film of all time. I am not a fan of horror movies which just proves how good a film this is! If you have not already seen this film I suggest you stop reading this and watch it right now! This film features what I consider the greatest twist of all time. It's even better than twists from films like Starwars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Planet of The Apes, The Usual Suspects and so on. You've Probably noticed all I'm doing is throwing a bunch of great things about the movie at you and that's because I feel this is the best way to explain the Masterpiece that is PSYCHO!

7 November 2003,Best horror movie of all times??,"Sorry, but I've never understood why ""Psycho"" is considered by so many people to be the best horror movie of all times (I give it only 7/10). Very influental it is, yes. Maybe also I've just seen a bit too many dozens of mass murderer movies based more or less on ""Psycho"", that the original doesn't feel so special anymore?

I think that a good movie must stand time and can be watched many times over and over again. Why should one want to watch ""Psycho"" again? The plot is so easy to guess even when seeing the movie first time that I find there not too much excitement.

What's the plot and idea of this movie? Some nut just goes killing innocent people, because he's crazy, and that's the whole story. Period. Scary? Well, as much as irrational violence is scary.

I also find it disgusting that in many horror movies psychotic people are often portrayed as the cause of all evil, when most of them are only very sick and mostly not particularly harmful to anyone. What is really scary - in real life or on a film - are people basically having everything ok and a good mental health, but still often doing horrible things, including irrelevant violence. Most violence in the world is done by such ""normal"" people.

I think that Hitchcock has many better movies than ""Psycho"". For example ""Rear Window"" is a true classic in its minimalism, though maybe not particularly scary, at least in the way modern horror movies playing mainly on special effects are. Anyway, there you have just an ordinary guy, could be your nextdoor neighbour, who cruelly kills his wife etc., Now that's a scary idea, and the plot makes you think too.",6
5 December 2016,Great Movie,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
14 August 2020,All These Years Later - Still The Best,"Stuck in a dead end relationship with a man who doesn't want to get remarried, Marion Crane makes the rash decision to steal money she was supposed to put in the bank for her boss in order for her and her boyfriend to have a cozy life. It's a fateful stop off at the backwoods Bates Motel that changes Marion's life forever when she meets Norman - the boyish motel manager who has a strange relationship with his emotionally abusive mother.

Hitchcock created his most perfect film when he decided to adapt Robert Bloch's novel of the same name and turn it into the movie event of the year - even going as far as to tell patrons they wouldn't be seated until the previous screening had come to a close. Hitchock's daring twists are still shocking to this day and his visual language is out of this world.

28 March 2006,What made Hitchcock Unique?,"I do not know which film has attracted the greatest number of IMDb user comments or ratings, but the database for Psycho currently includes a total of 511 comments, and there are 64,372 users who have rated this film at an average of 8.6 - giving it the #23 spot in the all time top 250 films. Hitchcock's Psycho was released in 1960, before most of today's cinema patrons were born, and today it is not often seen either in the few remaining repertory cinemas or even on TV movie channels. Younger viewers will never be able to experience the shock that this film created when first released. Seeing it on a home DVD can give no hint of its original impact in the theatre. In principle one might expect that by now this film would be nothing more than a fading memory for most of today's movie goers, but instead new comments on it are being submitted to IMDb on an ongoing basis and major film reviewers also continue to discuss it in numerous other publications. Such facts probably tell us all that we need to know about Psycho; but, even if they do not, there can be very little left to say to add to the 511 comments already published by IMDb.

Although I originally had no intention of adding any comments, I have gradually become forced to change my mind by the flood of copies, near copies and look alike films that attempt in one way or another to trade on the reputation of Hitchcock's masterpiece. We have an almost shot for shot remake with the same title (1998), as well as Psycho II (1983), Psycho III 1986, Psycho IV (1990), and American Psycho (2000). In total IMDb now lists 97 films with Psycho in their title and many of these clearly hope to exploit the reputation of this 1960 film in one way or another. There are others which also exploit it, sometimes even more blatantly, without trading on its actual title; even though they may be released with titles such as The Psychopath or Psychotic. It is difficult to comment meaningfully on most of these films before my comments on Hitchcock's original are on record, so here goes: Firstly I must take issue with those who imply that Hitchcock was the originator of horror films per se, or even that he was the first director who understood how to use a movie camera to create horror, suspense and tension. If you really believe this, go back and carefully look again at the early masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) in which the use of many techniques later so effectively exploited by Hitchcock can be found. Although Hitchcock actually directed one film in 1914, long before Dr Caligari was released, only part of this survives; and even his greatest fans would find it difficult to claim him precedence in the exploitation of these techniques. Hitchcock success was due to his mastery of cinematographic imagery combined with a very adept hand in using whatever technological or artistic developments were available to the maximum advantage. Most of his early work was carried out in the period when colour stock was not readily available or was very expensive and potentially unreliable. Until his reputation as a director was firmly established, Hitchcock was not free to make his films in colour and most of his early ones were shot in monochrome. But before he created Psycho he had filmed a long string of successes, in full colour, starting I believe with the period drama Under Capricorn in 1949. He had also experimented with one important film released in 3D format (Dial M for murder), and his choice of monochrome for Psycho was clearly made because he believed that it would be artistically more effective made in this way. This judgement was so accurate that even today when every movie goer has some familiarity with the story, it is almost universally agreed the visual impact from watching Psycho is far greater than that from a whole library of more recently made horror films.

Psycho did not however become the classic it is simply because it is a very effective horror film. The horrors of World War II and the fears associated with the development of the atomic bomb provided more than enough material to occupy most movie makers during the period immediately before 1960, but these horrors remained remote from everyday life in normal North American communities. Hitchcocks genius probably lay primarily in recognising this, and becoming the first major filmmaker to exploit the horrors that result when individuals with normally insipid personalities undergo some experience or trauma that leads them to behave in ways which those who know them can neither understand or comprehend. To see a Hitchcock film generally involves not viewing in a detached way what might happen in some remote and hazardous locale far away from home, but watching with mounting horror what might easily occur in ones own home community in the not too distant future. There are more and more directors who try to make horror films today, but unfortunately very few of them even understand this is why Hitchcock's films remain so much superior to their own.

Hitchcock has frequently met well justified criticism for unduly cavalier treatment of the novels that he filmed - he regarded a novel as no more than a framework on which to hang an often very different story created in a different medium, and for this reason his films often irritated readers of well loved books such as Buchan's ""The ThirtyNine Steps"". Although this may also apply to Psycho, we should consider how many readers today would be familiar with the works of Robert Bloch if his novel had not been filmed by Hitchcock?",9
13 May 2008,"Good ending,but time will hurt this film.","This film started somehow,and the whole film seemed good for first look.As I can remember my mother sad some-when at the middle of the 90-S,this is a famous film.I had seen the Gus Van Sant-version,and cause I know that is almost the same,(in some parts almost from cut,to cut)and I wanted to read what negative reviews says about the original,and the remake.I was surprised,some of the negative comments are not says incoherent things about it.If you will do the same,you can see,what is the point,or thing where your,and others opinion not the same.And this is a great thing.Alright,I know you knew what I'am talking about,I just wanted to say:that is a very good thing,if you have opinion,about this film,cause Psycho(1960),has some interesting points,(the ending,the concept,or the visuals)but all the way I can see problems,with the same points.Against typical 60,S-Alfred style not send to the bed the whole creature,but all the way the style,the written,the characters,and some other little things could have been so much better,or different.But if you loved this film,seemed like time,and the major part of the IMDb-users are still agreeing with you.

2 February 2011,"Hitchcock: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy.""","I agree with the fact that it has been of (most) importance for the movie industry because of some new elements it introduced. But besides that and the good directing, it totally lacks of brilliance. The actors were OK, but not worthy of all the praise they were given for it... Just take a look at what they have achieved in life: Anthony Perkins: 1 Oscar nomination (for supporting role), Janet Leigh: 1 Oscar nomination (for Psycho, which tells us a lot), and I won't even mention Vera Miles simply because there is nothing to mention. These are no great actors, not in any other movies, and neither in Psycho. Then we come to the story, the part of the film I really did not like. There's simply nothing brilliant about it, it's merely a plain story. Also, it was a little too obvious, referring to the fact that Norman's mother was already dead. This should have been worked out better, just like the shower scene. OK, the idea was brilliant, but I just can't believe, even back in 1960, that people find this shocking. It was such a let-down, I had expected so much more of this scene... It really looked like a big comedy. I know that many of the Psycho fans will disagree with my opinion, but let me just quote Hitchcock to add force to my opinion: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy. Had to be."" Then I wondered, how come it still has become a classic? Well, allow me to again quote Hitchcock: ""Even my failures make money and become classics a year after I make them.""",6
27 June 2000,"A thrilling, suspenseful, sensational.....","If anyone likes a thrilling, suspenseful movie, this is one to see. Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh played their part as near to perfection as anyone could ask. I personally didn't like Vera Miles in this movie; she always jumped to conclusions and was anxious.

I also happened to see a show called ""Dial H for Hitchcock"", before seeing this film, which gave away the ending, so I knew beforehand the truth. Let that be a warning. Anyone who plans on seeing any of Hitchcock's movies, stay away from ""Dial H for Hitchcock"", until you have seen the movies.

I feel that Hitchcock was one of the greatest director's of all time, and he will always live on through the memories of his classic and timeless movies.

17 December 2010,Awesome.,"I shall never look at motels the same way. They are disturbing. Actually I've always thought they were disturbing. Hitchkock probably always did too. This movie delivers tension like no other. The famous shower scene gets me every time I choose to watch the film(Psycho). When ya first saw you didn't see it coming. But then when you saw it again, you anticipate in dread. So it's got REPLAY VALUE. Excellent photograpy and camera work. The house on the hill sure is spooky. And the ending scared the crap out of me when I was little. I still does. It's such a disturbing looking skeleton. It looks like an ape for crying out loud! Gee whiz. It sure is a great flick. Hitchkock foreva. Rest in peace my dog.

8 March 2006,The Ultimate Horror movie,"Psycho was one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous works. It gave us a killer that looks like the rest of us. He could be living next door to you and you wouldn't know he's a killer unless you became one of his victims.

Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) runs a motel. One day Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) stops overnight to rent one of the rooms. She has a secret, and that secret is that she just stoled 40 thousand dollars in an attempt to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) to leave his wife an marry her. She finds more then she bargained for at the motel however.

Soon after her sister (Vera Miles) and a friend come looking for her, only to find a little mystery themselves involving Bates and his mother. Bates' mother is never seen clearly on screen, but we do hear her horrible voice a number of times. The mystery surrounding Bates and his mother is now known as one of the biggest shocks in cinematic history, along with a certain shower scene that just about everybody remembers.

Alfred Hitchcock uses lighting and camera angles, along with creepy atmosphere, to give us one of the best horror movies ever. The movie is black and white, but this only adds to the scariness of the film. This movie also contains one of the best musical scores of any horror film. I'd say only the Halloween theme matches it for scariest ever.

Psycho is, without a doubt, one of the best horror movies ever made, and it deserves its high rating on IMDb. It's in my top five list of greatest horror films and rightfully so.",10
22 October 2006,Flawless,"A groundbreaking film from beginning to end even by today's standards. Psycho has been reviewed over and over in Film schools and Universities and with very good reason. Alfred Hitchcock was a savage stuffed bird genius. He was so very inventive, courageously creative and true to his cause. He was so ahead of his time. Psycho has no clichés, on the contrary it broke boundaries and crushed all sorts of taboos in film making. Apart from shocking this film must have been downright scandalous too. This film is great from all angles. Starts with Janet Leigh fleeing the city with the stolen cash like an escaped canary to freedom or the unknown dangers outside. Hitchcock was obsessed with birds and totally inspired by them, yes hence the movie 'The Birds'. The suspense in Psycho is superb. We are constantly at the edge of our seats and what comes to us is way beyond our expectations and imagination. Anthony Perkins was perfect for the role which was to follow him for the rest of his days. He even had the right shape for this part and that is were I think they failed the most in trying to remake this film, it was a small but very effective detail, they did not take into consideration the shape of this man Hitchcock had chosen. Hitchcock was also the first as far as I know to ever slash our starring attractive blonde actress to pieces in the middle of the movie and sending the film off into another direction with our suspense at its peak. The shower scene is an all time classic that must have downright shocked the audience at the time because even watching it today will keep you with it imprinted in your memory forever, no matter what we are used to seeing on our screens today. The irony in those shots is that as they were being shot Hitchcock is going ""cut"" ""cut"" ""cut"".....That knife is the beak of a bird of prey. Metaphorically there are birds everywhere in this film as in most of his work. The mother is a stuffed bird.",10
7 July 2001,better in black and white,"the movie i watched at the begging of july 2001, a little late but hey! i thought it was quite good beening in black and white, i watch the psycho 98 (remake) straight after it and for some reason i thought it was worse than the original one. No i do not say it is the scariest movie infact there has been no movie that has every scared me, they just tell either good or bad stories.

13 April 2014,MY REVIEW: Welcome to the World of Alfred Hitchcock!!,"Psycho. It has been more than 50 years now when this Hitchocokian piece of amazing cinematic experience was first shown to the world and it has not dated at all. A chilling story, watertight screenplay, detailed narration, solid acting, subtle conversations and on top of it the magical touch of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock did not need gore or violence to spook you, he did it with just creating the creepy atmosphere and giving you scares at the right moments. Janet Leigh as the victim of its own actions and Anthony Perkins as the mysterious guy give you chills now and then. There is hardly any unwanted scene and Hitchcock makes you root for all characters including the evil ones. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Psycho. This is my first triumph with Alfred Hitchcock's old world of black and white gems and I am sure I am going to dive deeper and deeper.

14 January 2021,A Masterclass in Suspense,"Hitchcock has always been credited for his ability to create incredibly suspenseful scenes in his films, and Psycho is a great example of this. Utilizing close ups that make the viewer feel boxed in, uncommon lighting scenarios that accentuate subtle features of the face to just slightly distort them and give off the uneasy feeling of looking at something familiar and yet unfamiliar, and some excellent framing and blocking, Hitchcock creates a timeless thriller masterpiece that had me absolutely hooked. Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is amazing as well; he creates this unsettling air about him that is noticeable immediately upon first meeting him. Of course, there is also the famous bathtub drain to eye transition in this film, which has to be mentioned as one of the best match cuts in cinema history.

The very few issues I had with the movie are mostly just that the film starts off a bit slow in the beginning, and that the ending fell a little flat for me, although these are basically just nitpicks. Definitely worth the watch!",9
23 April 2004,Get's Better Every Time,"When I watch Psycho I always see something new with it. That is something which is a joy when watching a film over and over again and always finding something new about it. Psycho is that kind of film. I studied the way Psycho was filmed in my Film Studies class and when you are taught to look at the film in a completely different way to when you actually watch it. Marion is a woman who has no idea. We are told by Hitchcock to not feel sorry for her because she is someone who has just robbed a man of his earnings and is on the run. Whilst she drives to her destination she is hearing all the voices of the people she had cheated and feeling guilty and on her way she bumps into many situations with a policeman and a car salesmen who make her feel un comfortable even more than she already is. She then arrives in the place where she thinks she is safe in the form of The Bates Motel. A secluded place where not to many visit. Here she bumps into the shy and vulnerable Norman who takes an interest into Marion the moment she steps into the motel. With Norman being so alone at many times except when his mother wants something from the house just above the motel he takes a shine to Marion as he is never bothered with guests and they bond over some tea. Marion does notice something unusual in Norman but believes this is because of his all demanding Mother and it takes it's toll on him but what she doesn't know is that Norman's life and way of living is more sadistic and terrifying than she cold ever imagine. I want talk anymore because everyone else knows what comes next.

What I found interesting about Psycho is how Hitchcock took the movie way beyond the lengths that any other films gone in the history of Hollywood. I mean Psycho was the first film ever to show a toilet being flushed and when Critics and audiences saw this they kicked up a huge fuss and little others thing to moan about. Psycho is one of the films which I do find terrifying and it must have been even more terrifying when it was released back in in 1960. Hitchcock is a director that was very rare to come across in the way of playing the it's audience and his way of brilliant filmmaking and when you look back at his films especially Psycho you realise he has put most of the directors we know where they are today.",
28 June 2021,Mother rules!,"Psycho takes place in December , yet not a Christmas decoration in sight and no one makes reference to the Yuletide season. Other then that good for it's time , but the film has aged and the plot holes have become magnified. Still wondering how Bates didn't suffer any financially with so very few customers. What income did he live on?

1 July 2021,Hitchcock is a mastermind,"Hitchcock always manages to create suspense in the most unlikely places, and this title didn't manage to disappoint.

Although it was supposed to be between my friends and I, they didn't show up, personally making it one star lower than it should be. The reason for them not showing up? They were rude.

Anyways, this film is amazing and everybody has to watch this at least once in their lifetime!

3 April 2012,"""Psycho"" spells the ABC of horror","The face of Anthony Perkins aka Norman Bates as the psycho has burned itself deep into the mindset of moviegoers since Hitchcock's horror thriller hit the silver screens in 1960. It's essential for a whole genre, as iconic and unmistakable as Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster in Jack Pierce's make-up and will be for many more generations to come. As far as horror movies go it can't get any better than this. Anthony Perkins remains stuck in your mind due to his nervously shy performance throughout most of the film, likable and odd at the same time, and the ice cold twist at the end makes perfect sense.

But the film is much more than Perkins. It's Robert Bloch's excellent script, Bernard Herrmann outstanding score, and then there's the director. Hitch shows his handwriting as the master of suspense in every detail. The black and white cinematography of course is crucial and used to perfection in ""Psycho"", the shadows and tilted angles contribute to an unnerving atmosphere. And who else would get rid of someone introduced as the protagonist after a third of the film? Or take the famous shower scene, where the master demonstrates his cutting edge editing abilities, literally. It's reduced to the necessary minimum, artistically composed for maximum effect. And the mise en scène of the final revelation, the secret that awaits in the basement? Heart-stopping. In short: ""Psycho"" spells the ABC of horror, and rightfully so.",10
14 January 2018,This is why classic are always the best,"So I finally watch it and I'm surpise that the movie feel short, still a good movie though. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates=Outstanding preformance! I have to admit my favorite scene is the shower scene because of how the mood was set. The acting is great, excellent pace, good script, and a classic story. I love this film and I hope the seqeals are good. This is my review on Psycho (1960), it's always gonna be a classic.

13 November 2015,A cleverly made psychological thriller film which can take audience wherever Hitchcock wants.,"First of all I was disappointed to see the movie in B&W. But, after watching the movie I can clearly understand why Hitchcock had chosen B&W over colour. If you are also thinking like me, don't care about the colour just watch this.If you don't, you are just giving up on the ""mother"" of all modern horror movies. No movie lover will take a risk of not watching Psycho. The cinema begins normally, in Phoenix, Arizona. The lead actress was a worker in a real-estate service corporation. She stole $40,000, which she had to put in bank and decides to leave the city. When she was driving, there must be scenes at her office and home to be shown. All we expect was to see those but not the face of the actress, but Hitchcock made a remarkable history to just show what is really needed. This makes you realize the mastery of Hitchcock. A psychological thriller which people didn't see till 1960, remains unaltered in its image.This connects to our minds directly. Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), the owner of Bates Motel and a Momma's boy looks like a friendly person. His action really brought the movie to life. An great movie which makes us predict what happens next, but deceives us every time in a HONEST way. Coming to the part which contributed majorly to the movie's success, MUSIC. Bernard Herrmann's score is quintessential. The music he gave makes the movie appealing at the most famous scene ""Shower Scene"". The most frightening scene is the out-of-nowhere murder of the Private Investigator. The music helped a lot here too. By continuously shocking the audience, Hitchcock took the movie in his direction, righteously. At the end, the audience will be shocked again and this is most horrifying too.",10
25 October 2005,10 reasons to like Psycho,"Sometimes a film will make you fall of your seat laughing. Maybe it will shock you beyond belief. Or, it could make you weep. These are all reasons to love movies. But, what really makes a movie great is the fact that it has more than just on good point. Psycho has many great points.

1) The story takes many twists and turns. It seems to change a bit after every set of minutes. The ending is the biggest twist of all. Psycho is nearly unpredictable.

2) Perkins performance alone is deserving of an Oscar. We see him twitch and tremble as Arbogast interviews him. He slowly becomes mistrustful and dramatic as he talks with Marion. Anthony Perkin's performance in here deserves to be ranked among the ""Best Male Performances of All Time!"" along with Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.

3) Hitchcock knew how to work a camera! His creative style brings the film to life. He films on top of the car hood to see Marion and her stalker in the beginning. The camera spirals backwards, using Marion's eye as the starting point after the shower scene. During the staircase scene, there is a stunning bird's eye view so we can see the killer and Arbogast.

4) The dialogue is fun and smart. How unforgettable is ""We all go a little mad sometimes""? It will keep you entertained and thrilled to hear. Even if the film is full of dialogue, it manages to keep you interested.

5) Do you know how much Hitchcock worked on this film? I heard the shower scene took days to film! Think about all those shots! Good thing it was all worth it, because the shower scene is one of the best parts of the film.

6) Another small, but genius part in Psycho was the part in the cellar. Lila Crane accidentally falls backwards and hits the light bulb, causing it to swing back and forth, to create a spectacular lighting effect.

7) The musical score is one-of-a-kind. I hear it re-playing in my head all the time. It's often parodied in shows and other movies. But, don't listen to them. The best music is in the opening credits.

8) The murder scenes are visually fantastic. The staircase scene brings sickening pleasure to the mind.

9) The voices we hear when Marion is driving away explain what's happening back at her hometown. This saves screen time and allows the story to continue without wasting precious time.

10) The ""main character"" Marion is killed off right after the infamous shower scene. I guess she really isn't the main character, (Norman is.) but it makes a fun twist, and the story still continues to flow.

Multiple things like this define a movie. So what if it isn't scary? Psycho is a one-of-a-kind film. It's THE Psycho. It's THE movie. It will forever remain timeless.

8 December 2010,Fantastic thrill seeker,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

24 July 2013,Overrated Slasher Relic!,"Psycho (and Alfred Hitchcock movies in general) is one of the most overrated films in cinematic history. First off this has nothing to do with any distaste for ""old"" or ""black and white"" movies, as I very rarely watch anything post-1980. But this movie is just really boring. Maybe it's because it is so iconic that any scenes that are supposed to be scary have been burned into pop culture, thereby dulling its power. The first half of the movie, while slow, held my interest enough but once the main character is killed off, I found the movie unbearable to sit through. Yes I understand that this film was a trendsetter as far as slasher flicks go, but I think a real good movie will draw in and hold its audience's interest just as much as time goes on - and Psycho does not! At least not mine. If its place in horror film history is really the only selling point for this flick then it really should be in a museum and not on your television. The Hammer Films, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Val Lewton's films, Black Sunday, The Exorcist - now those are movies that have stood the test of time and retained their entertainment value and fright factor. I give this five stars for the good camera work and Anthony Perkins, who really eats up his role.",5
8 November 2008,The one that started it all,"When released in 1960 Psycho's impact on the horror genre was so great that 48 years later filmmakers still seem to be influenced. Psycho inspired movies like Halloween,Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street,Child'd play and many more. When I watched it for the first time a couple of months I was worried that I wouldn't appreciate it seeing as the twist is widely known. Despite knowing the twist it was still shocking and I throughly enjoyed it. The scene in which they find out the truth about Norman Bates mother still disturbs me. The star of the movie has to be Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance was outstanding, especially in the scene in which he almost shows his true colours. Psycho is a true gem and in my opinion has made a valuable contribution to the horror genre. Absolutely unmissable.

24 February 1999,It scared me,"Of course the shower scene has been so cliched over the years that it was hardly a surprise. Several other moments, though, were truly terrifying.

Janet Leigh is a dish.

Do yourself a favor and watch it from the beginning.

26 August 1999,Great Shock Treatment,"This surgical ultimate horror brings the greatest dark mind psychology on the screen. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is absolutely magical. Fabulous plot, camera and directing along with great performances make this film one of the best films ever made. This Horror is dry reality shuffled with some deep dirty connotations. Sympathetic Janet Leigh played fantastic naive villain while driving around during the escape stops at Bates Motel and got herself into a trap.

8 December 2000,Frightening !,"I'd heard all the rumours that Psycho was a scary film. They were all true. The film is in three parts, the first with Marion leaving town with her boss's money, the second part begins with her arriving at The Bates Motel. I'd heard there was a shower scene, but not having seen the film I didn't know whether she was stabbed, shot, strangled or what. So when the curtain is pulled back I wasn't surprised. Shocked at the fact Norman tries to stab her about three times and misses, and finally catches her. Arbergast getting stabbed in the eye (?) by ""Mother"" at the top of the stairs is hideous, but at the same time funny. Part 3 consists of Sam & Marion's sister Lila investigate her whereabouts and Bates is caught trying to stab Lila as ""Mother"".

A frightening film, it scared the sh*t out of me, I don't mind telling you !!

Whether I'd watch it again is another matter....

30 July 2010,A Classic that should never have been touched,"Well first of all, I liked to say that the Psycho remake was a lovely piece of garbage and that Alfred Hitchcock's original should have never been touched.

When Alfred Hitchcock made this film just over 30 years ago, it was a huge hit with anyone. Not my most favorite horror film ever though this was a classic masterpiece that should not have been touched afterwards.

The music is greatly chilling, the surroundings that are among us in this film are just sensational and then the ending of seeing Norman Bate's dead mother really left me in suspense. There where no negatives about this film. I'm just giving everyone advice about the remake. Watch it once, and then never ever watch it again because it is full of crap. The remake has no original ideas and it just copies straight out of the Original, though with no suspense.

I think this is a great horror movie and also it's a lovely display and probably Hitchcock's best film made. This film is also a good one to watch over and over again because when Alfred Hitchcock created this film, it started the Slasher Genere off really well. To me the Original Psycho later on created other great slasher flicks like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""Halloween"".

30 December 2019,Hitchcock's magic has never been better,"Psycho is as much a meditation on fear as it is an outright horror film. The master's most well known film is a masterclass in case and character study. With the exception of Halloween, no latter-day horror/thriller has been capable of generating as many goosebumps. The black-and-white photography is perfect for the film's tone and mood - the starkness of color would have blurred the nightmarish quality. The painstaking care with which Hitchcock composed every scene is evident in the quality of the final product. Psycho may not represent the master director's pinnacle, but it is the motion picture for which he is best known, and its legacy is inarguably one of the most far reaching of any film to come out of a Hollywood studio. With Psycho, Hitchcock dabbled in cinematic taboos, pushing the censorship envelope. This is a film that s rightfully considered a benchmark and a milestone of horror.

5 July 2019,A classic. You've gotta love it.,"One of Hitchcocks's bests, if not his best. Amazing acting, amazing story, amazing twist and incredibly filmed. Subtle thriller. May not scare nowadays but still is flipping amazing, probably my favourite film ever!

14 August 2016,A Great Hitchcock Suspense Film,"Let me begin by saying that I grew up in the 80's, meaning that I am of the generation that was reared in the age of ""Friday the 13th"", ""A Nightmare of Elm Street"", and ""Halloween"". Those ""slasher"" films as they're often called set the stage for later horror flicks the likes of ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", along with a slew of other more modern horror films that follow in the legacy of movies with very intense villains.

The first time I saw ""Psycho"" was around five years ago, and I had heard that it was the prototype of all of the above modern horror movies that I'd grown to love from my adolescence. I was quite let down, as this film is far from a Freddie, Jason, or Michael type of movie. Instead, this film is a ""horror"" film of a different time and era--the era in which Alfred Hitchcock was synonymous with the genre. And, inasmuch as that's true, ""Psycho"" has an altogether different feel than any of the post-""Exorcist"" or post-""Halloween"" horror films which have come to be more popular nowadays. Another way of putting it might be that this movie may rightly be considered a ""horror"" movie, but it's not really a ""scary"" movie by today's standards. Creepy at points? Yes. Scary? No.

That said, I gave this movie a second chance today at a screening at a local historic theater. This time I went into it expecting a Hitchcock movie rather than a modern horror film--and I was not let down. Expectation is everything when it comes to what you get out of a movie, and when before I went hoping for an introduction to a gruesome killer the likes of Michael Myers, I left feeling like I'd been ripped off. But when I watched this movie knowing what to expect--a film high on suspense, with a psychopath as the main villain, albeit one that is a bit cheesy by today's standards--I found myself thoroughly enjoying this movie.

I don't think I'm alone in feeling that this film has lost its horrific element in light of modern horror story telling. At one of the most climactic parts of the film (not the well known shower scene, but rather the climax involving Mrs. Bates later on toward the end of the movie), everyone in the theater literally laughed out loud. Perhaps not robustly, but still--the audience's reaction to a scene that was meant to be grotesque was laughter. That's how cheesy parts of this film can be by 2016 standards.

And yet, still, when you watch the film for what it is--a suspense filled Hitchcock movie which deals with concepts of ethics and karma, along with the story of a hermit turned psychopath, this is an extraordinary movie.

Two of the things that I like most about the film are the great camera work and its score. The movie is in black and white, but its picture quality is sharp (I saw it in digital projection), and the cinematography is as good as any ever put on the silver screen. And that theme song! The violins rushing this way and that--definitely one of the movie's best attributes.

All that said, I'm giving ""Psycho"" a score of 9/10 stars, which is much higher than I would have given it when I expected a more modern touch, and indeed much higher than I imagined myself giving the movie when I walked into the theater. Perhaps the only thing making this movie fall just short of a 10/10 is that there are a few little plot holes that seem somewhat obvious if you think things through for a moment--but I won't go into those as it would require spoiling some things. The point is that this is a great movie, so long as you know what kind of vibe to expect. I highly recommend it--just know that you're watching a suspense filled Hitchcock movie, not a modern day horror film.",9
25 July 2021,Masterpiece,"A masterpiece in the genre of horror. So if you are confused about watching it because you have a prejudice because its an old movie please beat this prejudice. Its totally worth to watch. I gave 9 because the killing scenes were bad but its totally normal because the movie made in 60's.

5 August 2021,Very Well Written and Portrayed,"Anthony Perkins does an outstanding job portraying his character. The story is very well written from start to finish. I like how this is original, and not an overdone type of theme. Very well done.

Overall, 8/10.

27 March 2021,Best horror ever?,"If you haven't seen this film don't worry it was made over sixty years ago. Don't worry if the story will stand up in modern times or that it is in black and white. You will never forget it. The first ten minutes is like a quaint retro American TV episode but the viewer is drawn in to something else and intrigue takes over. Maybe the best horror film ever made.

17 February 2007,THE greatest horror movie ever made.,"A very natural, or unnatural and unpredictable movie about Norman, the owner of Bates Motel and his mother. Truly Hitchcock's greatest ever.

Well it starts off when Marion Crane, an employed woman is given duty by her office to carry $40000 to a place. She sees this as her best opportunity to change life forever and live it up to the most. Like any other cunning human being, Marion steals the money and heads to Phoenix in Arizona. On the way, she is forced to change her car to avoid any suspicions by anybody about the crime she's just committed, as the thought goes through her mind every minute. Somehow managing to exchange her car to a pre-owned one, she carries on when suddenly there is a huge storm and finds no other choice but to stop nearby at Bates Motel near the highway, an isolated place. The owner of the motel, Norman Bates escorts her to her room and even offers to have dinner with him. The two have a long conversation, Norman mostly talking about himself and his dear old mother. Marion listens with interest and finally ends up going back to her room for a shower, where the story begins....

Remarkably the greatest horror or thriller movie ever made, Hitch's best. Like ever, no scene in this movie is imaginable for any first time viewer. Hitch being intelligent ever to make it black and white adds to its brilliance. My all time favorite.",10
16 July 2016,Triumph of Fear,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
9 February 2023,The best film in the history of cinema by the best director in the history of cinema,"The best film in the history of cinema by the best director in the history of cinema.

First-class direction, unique performances and the final sequence of the film, which is transmitted to the audience in the form of a narrative in his(Anthony Perkins) mind, psychologically.

Janet Leigh's wonderful performance and her challenge in the film is a complete breakthrough in this film.

Also, the unique soundtrack, first-class cinematography and a masterpiece script complement the creation of this masterpiece by Alfred Hitchcock.

Undoubtedly, Psycho deserves the first place in the world in classic and modern cinema.",10
21 February 2021,It was alright,"It was alright but I got kinda bored. Maybe I'm just smart enough to think it's a masterpiece I'm pretty dumb. Got room temperature IQ but in celsius not fahrenheit which is worse.

But yeah if you really like film stuff and getting all deep with the meaning of film elements, camera angles, codes and conventions and stuff you'll like it. However if your a low IQ watcher like me than it's probably not for you.

Fam squad out!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎄🔥🔥🔥

20 June 2011,Terrifying Presence,"IMDb Top 250: 24 Psycho is one of the most iconic films ever. The simple name, the menace, the immortal shower scene. the immortal, impossible- to-form-as- words screech of the violins during the most intense scenes in the movie. Psycho has stood the test of time, even 50 years later.

It's still important to know that this film has aged, but only because cinema evolved. Movies became more graphic and visceral, but Psycho can still ensnare you in its grasp. Hitchcock is a brilliant director, it seems that everything is so easy to him. He has nine films on the 250, more than anyone else.

It's interesting: over a half hour goes by before Marion reaches the Bates Motel,and the film is one hour fifty minutes. Time is taken to set up a plot and develop characters, which happens less and less today. Hitchcock takes his time... and when he strikes, there is true terror. The plot moves along, never taking too much time, and everything wraps up well.

Most of the acting is fine, but Anthony Perkins stands out. 1960 must've been a strong year for him to not be nominated for Best Actor. His casual walk, his kind smile, it's unnerving. Something's up with Norman Bates. But the little things make it: his eye movements, muscle twitches- especially those- make him the star of the show.

Yeah yeah yeah... the shower scene. Truth is, it's probably the most aged scene in the movie. But I won't dwell on something most of you already know.

I was surprised by the music. While the screech is universally-known in film circles, I was impressed with the rest of the music, which fits the film completely.

Psycho is an experience that must be seen by any film fan. If you can picture yourself in 1960, you could be shocked. Psycho is greater than the sum of its parts. 9.2/10",9

7 January 2010,Still chilling after all these years.,"This is the mother of all slasher films and that chilling feel that some horror movies have. Instead of straight horror like monsters and ghosts, Psycho makes a physically normal human being more terrifying than any movie monster you've ever seen. What's so scary is that it could have happened, and if I'm not wrong Psycho is based on a true story. This movie is still chilling after all these years.

I really wish modern day movie makers would go back to the feel of Hitchcock's movies. There's just something really scary about them. The realism, the acting, the cinematography and the music are just unique. There are few, but still some people who managed to continue the feel of Psycho. Take John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) a knife wielding maniac attacking babysitter at Halloween night. he wears a mask to hide his face and has no human emotions left whatsoever. And take the 2000 film American Psycho, a normally looking businessman who's well liked for his success, performs random violence and gruesome fetish killings at night. I Alfred Hitchcock had still lived i think he would have been very proud of the Psycho legacy.

I must admit after years with seeing parodies and hearing references certain scenes of the movie isn't particularly scary anymore. Like the shower scene which has became a bit of a cliché by now. Nonetheless it's still a unique moment that shocked the audiences in 1960. But I warn you, even though some scenes are a bit outdated, it will still give you a scare. I'm serious I saw ""the Exorcist"" with no problem, but this movie freaked me out.

This movie deserves attention for it's legacy and it's great actors and of course Hitchcock himself. I give it a 9/10.",9
31 August 2014,"Man, this is the weirdest adaptation of A Rose For Emily I've ever seen","A woman with a secret meets a man working at an out-of-the-way motel. He is neurotic but charming, and the two of them decide to eat dinner together. She learns about his problems getting out from under his domineering mother, and encourages him to stand up for himself. And then he stabs her to death.

Psycho works so well not because it is gory or innately terrifying but because it uses the familiar tropes of romantic comedy to set up a string of horrific murders. It suggests that the ordinary people we like or even feel sorry for are just as dangerous as the ones we instinctively fear. Norman Bates' twisted psyche ties together love, violence, and the Oedipal complex -- Hitchcock's favourite themes, perhaps never realized so well.

I've always been something of a Hitchcock skeptic, and Psycho contains its share of the overcomplication and affectedness that often dogs his work. There's a lot of glut here -- the whole plot line of Marian stealing the money, the tedious investigation sequence after the first murder, and the clumsy exposition that puts everything in a neat little box at the end. If Psycho is great, it's not because of Hitchcock but because of Anthony Perkins, who makes Norman Bates somehow pitiable and terrifying at the same time. The scenes he shares with Janet Leigh are captivating, and more than make up for the less memorable material surrounding them.

Psycho may not live up to its reputation, but it's still well worth a look. You won't get a more pure exhibition of Hitchcock's obsessions than this, and you're not likely to see a better performance anytime soon.",8
13 August 2007,"Thank You, Alfred Hitchcock!","Alfred Hitchcock is clearly one of the greatest directors the world has ever seen. He proved this to me with Psycho, a film that has transcended time and technology to remain a masterpiece. It is ahead of its time in all its aspects: Cinematography, music, even the fantastic performances from the incredible cast. And it is all put together by a master: Mr. Alfred Hitchcock.

Most people by now know the classic story: A young woman stuck in a road-blocked love affair steals $40,000 in a desperate last attempt to make a life with her boyfriend. She stays the night at a deserted and somewhat decrepit old motel, where she meets a young man who may not be quite what he seems. I won't say more. I was lucky enough to know nothing about the story when I watched it, and it only made my experience all the more thrilling.

I must give credit to the absolutely perfect performances from each and every cast member. Both of the leading ladies are excellent. Janet Leigh plays the woman who stole the money, Marion Crane, while Vera Miles plays her sister. But of course the show completely and totally belongs to Anthony Perkins in what is probably one of the greatest performances ever given. He plays the young man who runs the old motel, and is our titular character. What Mr. Perkins did with this character is brilliant: He's a seemingly kind and attractive man. It's pure brilliance.

Yes, Mr. Hitchcock gave us a true masterpiece with Psycho. It remains still one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I had trouble getting to sleep two nights afterwards! The film is shocking as well as groundbreaking. Thank you, Alfred Hitchcock! 10/10 stars!

15 May 2007,Two Psychos in This Movie?,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

19 September 2003,Still one of the all-time great shockers,"I was fortunate to see this movie at the theater. Unfortunately, I already knew most of the story, so I could only enjoy the shocks through the audience. One of those films that it is hard to talk about for fear of giving away any of the numerous surprises. All I will say is that this film has one of the best casting jobs in history. Everyone is perfect for their role. Even though the description of the movie is rather bleak, there are many funny lines in the movie that are even funnier upon repeat viewing (Hitchcock has said that this was a comedy). I even like the much-maligned ending; ends the film on a satiric note. One of the best movies ever made.

29 August 2017,Revolutionary Horror Film,"I just recently seen this film for the first time ever. I didn't know much about in terms of story, actors, or really much of anything except it is considered Hitchcock's most popular film. After nearly 60 years later the film still has an impact. One thing is for sure, it inspired modern horror. A smart, bone-chilling, suspenseful horror film. No other horror film has had as much gravitas as Psycho before it, or since. The film is practically flawless starting with a sinister performance by Anthony Perkins. It doesn't take long once we meet him that something is definitely amiss with him. That's one of the things that Hitchcock does so well is he constantly cranks up the suspense, and twists our nerves and minds until it can't be tightened anymore than he lets loose. Revealing twists and turns no other director would ever think of. Psycho perfectly represents that, as the characters are well thought out, and each scene is cleverly put together. This film also holds some of the most iconic moments in cinema. Along with the creepy wrenching music by Bernard Herrman, which adds a whole new level of tension, to bring these wonderfully eerie scenes to life. As no other film before or since has ever reached the magnitude to Psycho, and it will stay that way for decades or even centuries to come. Story: A+ Characters: A+ Music: A+ Scare Factor: A Overall: A+",10
29 April 2023,"Slow forerunner of horror, not quite as good as THE TWILIGHT ZONE","I took a class on Hitchcock in high school, where we watched several movies by the revered director. In my opinion, his work is almost as timeless as The Twilight Zone. However, The Birds and Psycho mar his filmography of great mysterious noir and usher in horror ahead of its time. Even though Psycho gets universal praise, I found it to be slow and without the jump scares which became perfected by the mid-90s. With only one or two scenes which really compel the audience to feel the surprise of an edge of their seat turn of events, this film plays too much on the atmosphere to be truly ranked among the greats of the genre. The main character is slightly unlikeable as the film begins, and this pulls me out of the story a bit. Overall, it's good, but not as good as they say.

17 January 2023,"8.1/10 - Great First Hour, The Rest a Little Pale in Comparison","""I think that we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out. We scratch and we claw, but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.""

Psycho, probably the film Alfred Hitchcock is best known for, is a 1960 psychological thriller/horror movie. It's considered by many as an early masterpiece that paved the way to many films in that genre to come. The film revolves around Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a troubled woman who wishes to take off with her lover and find herself a better life. Trying to do so she gets, in a hurry, to the Bates Motel, an unpopular motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) in the middle of nowhere. As the film progresses, things begin to slowly go awry, more and more with every passing moment.

I'd consider Psycho a film with two distinct parts - a subjective psychological dive and a more objective mystery-solving segment that sheds more light on what came before it. The first hour or so of the film, the psychological dive, is definitely more powerful to me than the rest of the film overall. The second part of the movie has some iconic moments as well, and I like it too, but it doesn't feel nearly as deep as the first one.

The first part of the film is way more thought-provoking, showing how we chase what seems to us as true freedom and happiness with all our might when we can't be truly free if our mind is enslaved to inner demons and mental illness. I don't think that I get the birds as a motif fully, but I think I have a pretty good grasp there. The second part of the film is much more technical, much more tell than show, but it's still pretty good. Just a little pale in comparison.

Some things about this film are absolutely excellent, though. The score is one of the best scores I've ever heard - eerie, disturbing (goes hard sometimes). Absolutely adore it. Perkins and Leigh also portray their characters perfectly, especially Perkins. Their characters are multi-faceted, intriguing, reflecting each other in interesting ways. Both of them are really top notch, and I totally love their performances.

The cinematography is much more interesting in the first part of the film as well - immersive, unsettling, sometimes slightly dream-like. The second part has some visually captivating shots and moments too, but overall it's weaker in that aspect (for reasons that make sense when you think of the nature of each part, but still).

I also really disliked the psychiatrist scene watching it for the first time, but rewatching made it a little better. Still annoying a bit but it's not horrible, really.

Overall I'd say that Psycho is a very good film. It's not consistently unique and thought-provoking, but its first hour or so is still great, the score is amazing and the eerie, unsettling vibes are totally there. Anthony Perkins truly kills it here, too. Aged well, worth checking out. I'm feeling an 8.1/10 on this one.",8
30 July 2000,"""I think we're all in our private traps""","Psycho was the first movie of the slasher genre, and remains the best. Its has been often imitated but has never been equalled. The 1998 remake tried to, but failed in capturing that atmosphere and sheer supense.Anthony Perkins gave the performance of his career and was typecast ever since. He was Norman Bates!. All the other actors gave great performances. Bernard Hermann's score still sends chills down my spine everytime I hear it.This in my opinion is one of the best and scariest movies ever made.

30 April 2021,The Literal Blueprint of an Entire Genre!,"Undeniably, this is the definitive masterpiece of veteran director Alfred Hitchcock. This movie has always been my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie of all time with Vertigo being at #2. Psycho also happens to be my favorite slasher movie of all time. This movie ought to be the very first movie that kick-started the whole notion of a protagonist potential victim and an antagonist killer / stalker kind of trend in movies. Some of the greatest slasher movies of all time including Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street etc were unequivocally influenced by the blueprint Hitchcock had left behind through Psycho. If it wasn't for Psycho, none of these movies would exist. 10/10 for this Slasher masterpiece from me.

Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
10 July 2009,Hitchcock's best,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially.

18 October 2001,"Without a doubt, Hitchcock's best.","Many of Alfred Hitchcock's movies are considered classics, but ""Psycho"" is easily his best. But the reason for that isn't Hitchcock, it's the cast and story.

Hitchcock is the kind of director who succeeds best when his movies deal strictly with person to person situations, and ""Psycho"" does this best. I have seen many, many Hitchcock movies and my peak of interest in all of these movies is when there is an intriguing situation between two or more people, such as the one-sided murder plot and its resulting conflict in ""Strangers On a Train,"" and the attempts of Barry Kane in ""Saboteur"" to clear his name of sabotage. However, in the case of these two movies and many other Hitchcock films, the person to person situation is almost destroyed by an overly large climax that is ridiculously corny. The merry-go-around scene in ""Strangers On a Train"" is an embarassment, and the Statue of Liberty scene in ""Saboteur"" is a few steps too far. Other bad climaxes include the hilariously bad fall Jimmy Stewart has at the end of ""Rear Window,"" and the lackluster mountain climax in ""North by Northwest."" ""Psycho,"" however, avoids these kinds of climaxes. ""Psycho"" stays on a person to person level throughout the entire movie and does not include a terribly corny ending (unless you count Norman being able to perfectly imitate an old lady's voice). Considering the odd set-up, a man assuming the role of his mother, the story of ""Psycho"" is executed rather realistically. Also (and I don't mean to slam Hitchcock) ""Psycho"" contains far more realistically portrayed characters than any other Hitchcock film. In other Hitchcock films, only one or two characters have any depth, while in ""Psycho"" there are five characters (Norman, Marion, Lila, Arbogast, and Sam) that have depth (though John Gavin's performance is a little stiff). Even supporting characters like Al Chambers and the detective at the end are very believable. Pat Hitchcock, however, as Marion's friend at work, does her part in destroying depth (as she did in ""Strangers On a Train""). But most of the scenes in ""Psycho"" are very well-acted, especially the questioning scene between Arbogast and Norman and their light-weight argument outside. As usual, ""Psycho"" contains the Hitchcock knack for irony (""The first customer of the day is always the most troubled,"" and ""Insect or man, death should always be painless), but, for the most part the realistic performances save the movie from too-much corniness and truly make it one of the finest movies ever made (one of my top five). 5 stars out of 5. The underrated ""Psycho II,"" (released in 1983) contains excellent performances all around and contains no irony whatsoever. Although ""Psycho II"" is generally liked, straying away from Hitchcock didn't sit well with some.",
16 February 2018,A must watch if you are film lover,"Psycho (1960) - A masterpiece from suspense and thriller guru, Alfred Hitchcock. He cleverly brings on the screenplay by potraying the ""mother"" role as a medium for all the murders and where else the son ""Norman Bates"" as a normal hotel receptionist. The plot twist at the last 20 minutes is the one that makes this movie still remembers till today by the film lovers.

22 October 2002,Best Film Ever Made !,"Psycho is the best film ever made ! I´ve no doubt about it ! It´s perfect ! The direction is perfect and it passes to the viewer the sensation of the bizarre , the suspense , the mystery and the dark mood as Hitchcock pretended to show. It´s a real shocker !

The screenplay is out of this world ! Joseph Stefano is a genius ! He and Mr. Hitchcock tricked us ! Everybody thought that It was a film about Marion Crane , a girl confused about her relationship with Sam Loomis , that decides to steal forty thousand dollars ! So we try to figure out how was she going to handle the situation ! But It ain´t the main point anyway ! Joseph and Hitchcock gave us a bait and we bit it !

This movie is well remembered by the very imitated shower scene ! Hitchcock (with the help of Saul Bass) designed it and used montage in this scene and it worked very well !

This film would not be the same without Mr. Hitchcock (off course) , Joseph Stefano and more two people : Bernard Herrmann and Anthony Perkins !

Bernard Herrmann composed an ""all made of strings"" dark music to Psycho and at nowadays it´s suspense synonymous ! It´s brilliant ! My personal favorite song is in that scene when Marion decides to steal the money and she is making her baggage ! By the way , that shot was a masterpiece too ! Hitchcock told us everything without a word (as in the beginning of Rear Window) , just showing the baggage , the money and Marion´s face ! Amazing ! Thrilling !

Anthony Perkins gave us the best interpretation in a motion picture ever ! Norman Bates is a very well developed character ! Tony is great as the fragile boy dominated by his crazy mother ! He has a strange glamour that make us believe that he´s innocent and he´s trying to hide the truth about his mother ! You still thinking : ""It can´t be ! He seems to be a good man !"".

It´s hard to me to describe the film that changed my life and the way I watched movies ... I didn´t know that a picture could be art ! I´m fanatic for this film ! If you have a chance , RENT IT , BUY IT , STEAL IT ... Whatever ! :)

Rating : Perfect.",10
15 April 2013,Best...nightmare...on real life...ever!,"""Psycho"" is simply the best horror film ever made. The story is incredible, the acting is near perfection, the cinematography is awesome, the soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find is the Inability to stand the test of time. One of the Reasons the shower scene has become so notorious Is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in the shower was something no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing double-Jason Spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. Psycho its nothing like that, it's more! Aside from this though, the movie is flawless, the cinematography it's just incredible. The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh to the beautiful and sexy Marion Crane; Vera Miles to the Concerned sister; Lila Crane excellent; and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins to the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates. The film not only scares you a lot, but leaves you stuck on screen until the end of the movie, and only the strong survive's the insane dialogs, mentally, in the end, it will haunt you to the end of your lives, because ...

28 June 2018,"Iconic and masterfully executed, though thematically slight","Psycho is a perennial horror classic for good reason. Its best scenes are among the most iconic in the genre and remain potently suspenseful and visually arresting even if they aren't quite horrifying by today's standard. Going toe-to-toe with the ""scare"" scenes are a couple of tense dialogue exchanges that are just as compelling thanks to Anthony Perkins' layered and chilling performance.

The highs are incredibly high, perhaps to a fault. Connective tissue scenes in the film which have the misfortune of resting before and after some of the best moments in horror can feel a bit mundane by comparison. There is an unevenness that has become more pronounced with repeat viewings, as I find myself looking forward to the best moments rather than enjoying each on its own merit. It may be a consequence of the fact that this is a film that is somewhat heavily reliant on its mystery and eventual twist, with many moments dedicated specifically to throwing the audience off the scent. Once you've seen the movie, the tricks take on a transparency that betrays the slightly shallow nature of the story. The execution makes up for these shortcomings convincingly, but Hitchcock has certainly made other thrillers that are much richer thematically (Rear Window, Vertigo), and less reliant on a central gimmick.

Regardless, Psycho absolutely shines in its best moments thanks to the excellent performances and Hitchcock's masterful direction. It certainly deserves its classic status in both Hitchcock's filmography and the horror catalog at large, even if it lacks the consistency and substance of some of his other classics.

Strong 4/5",8
8 February 2010,The movie that redefined a genre,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was the movie that revolutionized horror forever. This is a must-see for anyone who calls themselves a connoisseur of horror. And while not the scariest film ever, or even in the top tier, it still provides a marvelous psychological aspect, and some genuinely terrifying moments.

Psycho also has one of the most famous horror sequences, and even movie scenes in general. Is there anyone who hasn't heard of the shower scene? This scene is famous for a reason. The eclectic shots, switching so frequently that it almost looks like still frames create an atmosphere of realism. This seems like a newscast, a real event. And that's what is so scary about this movie. It seems completely real, as if these events could happen. Hitchcock caters to the imagination, his brand of fear rooted in emotion, not visuals.

Hitchcock's classic black and white tale of passion and horror was revolutionary for the time, and consequently has spawned a slew of imitators. None of these emit the intensity so easily shown in Hitchcock's Psycho. There has even been a remake, a travesty to the original. In the spirit of honor, the 1998 film with Vince Vaughn should change it's name so it won't be associated with this 1960 gem.

Hitchcock was, and actually still is, a force to be reckoned with in this league. He is a force of nature. New horror movies come and go, and, aside from a very select few, are forgotten in a matter of months. Hitchcock as shown his staying power in the dog eat dog world of horror by creating not one, or two, but countless classics. The greatest of these, though, was unquestionably his little came changer called Psycho.",7
27 December 2002,Horror/Suspence at it's best,"Hitchcock I must say has made some great movies, and Psycho is one of them. From the opening credits to the end credits, Psycho captured me in my seat and didn't let me go until the end.

For all fans of Horror movies Psycho is a nearly perfect release. It has all the elements of a modern film, in fact, this film, if it wasn't in black & white, could have been made yesterday.

Psycho bridges the gap between classic horror films and modern slashers in less than two hours, and to this day, should be remembered as one of the greatest movies. Not only for fans of Hitchcock, Horror and suspence, but also for casual movie watchers.

20 April 2000,NOTHING SPECIAL DESPITE AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BY ANTHONY PERKINS!,"Psycho**[2 Stars]- There is nothing good or bad about this movie. Its just an ok movie. The acting isn't great nor bad. But Anthony Perkins gives an excellent performance as Norman Bates and theres nothing great about any of the other actors. Also the shower scene is effective but it should have been longer. If you're a major Alfred Hitchock fan than I would recommend this movie to you but if not than skip this and go on to 'Psycho 2***[3 Stars]''.

6 June 2016,Best Film by Hitchcock,"I was entirely impressed by this movie, since the beginning you feel something bad is gonna happen because of the music and the dialogues, but you won't understand until the end what is all about. You think the story goes on one direction but then you realized you were wrong talking about the characters and their motivations. You really feel you're watching a thriller, you feel as nervous as Marion all the time. The music was amazing, the scenes and the script. I would say it's a perfect movie. I wanna keep the story like that and won't watch the other Psycho movies. It is also interesting to know all what the movie involved during the production and after. For example the shower scene is one of the most memorable in horror films, the relationship between Norman and his mother is 'represented' in the Simpsons by Director Skyner and his mother, and, Antony Perkins couldn't get more success after his performance and he died in 1992, he got VIH.

13 August 2007,The Best Hitchcock,"""Psycho"" has held a well-deserved spot in my top five favorite films of all time, and I have no doubt that it will stay there forever. It's got everything you could ask for in a movie of its type. ""Psycho"" is extraordinarily scary, especially for an older film. The B & W cinematography is enchanting and very creepy. Hitchcock sure knows how to shoot a movie and surround himself with the right people.

The acting in ""Psycho"" is also amazing. Anthony Perkins is beyond creepy as the multi-dimensional Norman Bates. Janet Leigh portrays the flawed damsel part perfectly, and she brings a great strength to the role.

I won't give the story's plot details so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that it is both incredibly compelling and strangely disturbing. There's a strong psychological aspect that gives the film a whole other dimension. You can watch it for the chills, the thrills, the themes, or all of the above. If you can only see one Hitchcock movie in your lifetime, let this be the one.",10
4 January 2021,No way 10/10 ratings are truthful,"Hitchcock fanboys have been hyping this for over 60 years. It's a good thriller movie, no reason to rate it R. There is basically no blood or violence ON CAMERA. The pefromances are mediocre at best. The effects are good for the 60s era I guess. 6-7/10.

24 May 2020,Nomen Omen,"If The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's most philosophical and technically challenging movie, Psycho is the most evident, even brazen, proof of the Leytonstone's director genius, an impossible movie bet that he won hands down!

Against the decision of Paramount, which regarded the filming of the Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, loosely inspired by a real murderer and grave robber, ""too repulsive"", Hitchcock defied the major and went ahead to fulfil his contractual obligation for a last film with the studio by purchasing the rights of the novel, producing the film with his own money, shooting in black and white after four years he had abandoned this feature, using his TV crew and the Universal studios, which he would then join for The Birds, his next film three years later.

But Hitchcock slap in the face of the film establishment was even harsher, punching below the belt of the Motion Picture Production Code, which set the cinema morale of the time, from the very start, with the opening scene showing and openly acknowledging, if not celebrating, an extra-marital affair and half-naked affair, and culminating later on in the pivotal shower sequence, with its nudity and the trailblazing slasher, Grand Guignol effects, used again at the end of the film to reveal Norman's mother, or, more trivially, showing for the first time in American movies a toilet flushing. He didn't stop here, though, introducing a strict and unusual ""no late admission"" policy for the film screenings, inspired by Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, not to mention the game-changer of eliminating the female lead, a false protagonist, just before half of movie running time, leaving a very controversial Norman Bates as the only main character. Unlikely for Hitchcock, Norman Bates persona is rather closely modelled on the real source of Robert Bloch's novel, Wisconsin killer Ed Gein, who like Norman Bates was a solitary murderer living in an isolated rural location, had a deceased and domineering mother to whom he had built a sealed off shrine in his residence and dressed in her clothes.

Notwithstanding all these idiosyncratic deviations, Psycho was an immediate success at the box office and still today is Hitchcock's' movie with the highest cumulative worldwide gross, forcing also part of the critics, originally puzzled by the film, to appreciate its unconventional values and the Academy to nominate it for four Oscars, giving none though and ignoring Anthony Perkins amazing performance.

In fact, one of the marvels of Psycho is indeed Anthony Perkins rendering of Norman Bates, making the character the ultimate psycho-murdered, a perverse icon of film history. While homosexuality had already been implied in Rope, Norman Bates' gender dysphoria becomes in Psycho the key element of the story, sublimely as well as subliminally played, most likely helped by his own sexual preferences, by Anthony Perkins, who subtly but unnoticeably reveals it early on during his dinner conversation with Marion, and it is actually plainly explained and theorised, even if maybe too didactically, at the end of the movie, just before the final, haunting close-up on Anthony Perkins' deranged look and female-voiced thoughts, themselves worth an Oscar. Regrettably

A daring, innovative masterpiece that went a long way to seal the 50s cinematography, opening the door for the more controversial 60s.",9
19 April 2021,It gets better every time you watch!,"Psycho is one of those movies when you re-watch it, you find more and more details that contribute to the ending. Everything about this film was intriguing, mysterious, and kept you on edge. Lighting and shadows were pushed further than I've seen in a film so far. A memorable and iconic film has to do with either the ending, the score, or a specific scene. Psycho takes the cake and checks off all three boxes multiple times. The actors delivered their roles and made you feel like you never truly knew what was going on, which added to the suspense. The ending totally threw me off guard, and made me rethink the whole plot. It's important to note how well the script was written, because it makes the ending that much better. Overall, this was a film of genius and really had you tearing your mind apart trying to piece happenings together. Nothing will prepare you for the ending!

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
27 December 2003,Don't get me wrong....but,"This is a very fine movie. Yet I grew a bit weary of it after the 4th or 5th time. The first time I saw it I raved. That is also when it left it's greatest impact. After you are knowledgeable of the conclusion, some of the impact wanes, if you know what I mean. It is a great movie but I think a bit over-rated. The second time I viewed it I am more able to appreciate the 'Hitchcock' technique of steering the viewer to assume a conclusion. In lesser hands this could have been mediocre. (See the sequels) Hitchcock has never failed to capture beautiful angles with each camera shot. Even after several viewings a veteran can still be unbalanced by Hitch's foreboding approach. Despite loving this film it would probably not be one I would select to show at a Halloween get-together - especially to those who have seen it a few times before. I am more 'chilled' by other movies. However, at a film discussion get-together - YES. If you haven't seen it - DO! You will love it!! If you've seen it once do see it again and enjoy Hitch's story-telling. He is quite good. If you've seen it frequently you are probably like me and don't NEED to see it again although it remains dear to your heart. I've often wondered how Hitch would have handled 'The Sixth Sense'?",8

26 July 2000,Ambushed,"I have never seen anything but good reviews of this movie. I saw it in its original run at the age of 24. I felt ambushed by it. Up to that time I had seen many Hitchcock films. Suspense, yes, horror, no. I loved Hitchcock films AND his TV show. But, I never went to another Hitchcock film for 10 years after that. Now, we have ratings -- But, they would not have protected me. I think you ought to be warned if you're going to see offensive violence. Some reviewers say it was a funny movie. They are wrong. I have never seen the whole movie again and never plan to.

Whilst the performances regarding acting a good, particularly Perkins the story is not credible, even laughable in places. If you want suspense then go for Rope. Hitchcock had lost his touch with this film including Birds

13 January 2001,humor is definitely there,"There's not much to comment on in regards to this basically perfect film. One thing that I hadn't thought about before reading some of the comments, however, is the sly humor woven into it. There are moments in Psycho that are kind of hilarious, actually. In a weird way, it's the blackest of black comedies. Oh, and by the way, Psycho has the greatest musical score of any movie ever, just in case there was any confusion on that point.

27 July 2000,INCREDIBLE,"Hitchcock was a very brave man. He fronted the $800,000 budget himself, and the film took in more than $40,000,000!!! And it is no wonder why it was such a huge success. The novel was incredible, and Joseph Stefano's script did a great job of telling the story. The sad thing about it was that it is based on a true event. The People of Plainfield, Wisconsin might remember about Ed Gein. I'll spare people's stomach fluids and not tell you the details. But this movie has all the classic Hitchcock elements. Do yourself a favor, watch it from the VERY beginning if you have not seen it before. That is all.

Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8

30 October 2012,Classic influential horror,"There's no denying Psycho's classic horror status. Hitchcock had done creepy Gothicism before, such as in Rebecca, and he'd done charming murderers before, such as in Strangers on A Train, but he hadn't done a slasher.

Psycho is what it says on the tin: it's about a psycho. Exploring the deep psychosis of a murderer was not something that had been done in Hollywood film before. We all know the shower scene but not everybody knows the nature of Bates' psychosis so I won't say anything on that topic. The psychiatrist at the end is a clumsy clunky Hollywood addition explaining the blatantly obvious. I fail to see that in 1960, the audience wouldn't have worked it out. It's a testament to Hitchcock that he still manages a creepy final scene. Bates may be a psycho but we can't dismiss him in the way that we may have dismissed previous psychotic villains.

Of course, the star of the film is Anthony Perkins. Everybody else is either bland or annoying and quite frankly, you want them all to die (maybe not the hot guy). Janet Leigh as Marion Crane...thank god we didn't have to spend too long with her. She spends most of the film in her bra (now a horror cliché)and steals loads of money from her boss. It's interesting that Hitchcock chose to make her so unsympathetic.

Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, the proprietor of the motel that Marion checks into. He looks just like a creepy bird but initially he's quite sweet. It took me a minute to clock that he was going to be our psycho. One thing I will say on his psychosis was that the psychiatrist says he is straight, which I don't entirely buy. I think that's just to placate the audience.

Now, Psycho has been compared to Peeping Tom (or rather, Peeping Tom has been endlessly compared to Psycho. See my review on Peeping Tom for more info). Peeping Tom came out a few months before and on the surface it has a lot in common with Psycho: both have a handsome man who is psychologically disturbed with parental troubles and murders women. However the major difference is that Psycho cemented Hitchcock's reputation and Peeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's illustrious career. So what gives? Psycho has lingering shots of a woman in a bra, gore and explicit horror; Peeping Tom has no blood, only brief nudity and no explicit horror. Surely if any film was going to shock the critics, it would be Psycho? Yet the only thing that the British censors objected to in that film was a flushing toilet.

Actually, no. Hitchcock was famously the master of suspense and had dabbled in types of horror before- it was obvious that he would progress to something like Psycho. Powell was known for his partnership with Emeric Pressburger, making beautiful innocent British films (although at times some of them are very dark). He threw a curve ball and we couldn't take it. In some ways, Psycho is a mystery story and in the moments when the boyfriend and Marion's sister are exploring the motel, it brings to mind some of the creaky mystery moments Hitchcock had in his earlier films (Stage Fright, for example). Peeping Tom is not a mystery story. Bates is a main character but Mark Lewis is our protagonist. We see everything through his eyes. Both characters are handsome and polite but once we know something's up with Bates, we don't view him in that way. We always know that something's up with Mark Lewis and yet he's so adorable and polite and we never want him to get caught. Ironically, there are many moments where he almost gives himself away and we're shouting at the screen telling him not to.

As for the psychology, Psycho explains everything. Bates is a classic textbook psycho. Lewis is a very disturbed pervert but he's more than a Psycho. His problems stem from the sadistic experiments his father does on him. We see some, but not all. What we do see is horrible but it's only scratching the surface. It's a more interesting imaginative bit of psychology than Psycho.

Finally, the cinematography. Both films do brilliantly here- there's lots of creepy jump cuts and close-ups in Psycho. A particularly creepy moment is when Bates is framed by lots of stuffed birds glaring down at him. And it's all in scary black-and-white but not the cliché lurking in the shadows. But for my money, the cinematography in Peeping Tom is better. It's filmed in garish seedy colour, which makes it all the more scary. There's a clever bit of filming where Mark is looking through a grill with a birds eye view of the room and then the angle changes so we see the pens from his pocket falling down. The whole premise of Peeping Tom is a guy who kills with his camera and the cinematography takes full advantage of this. Filming in shadows and gloom is a cliché- luckily neither film does that.

Psycho is still a scary film- dated in its treatment of the secondary characters but modern as ever with its treatment of the psycho. Loads of thrills and chills to be had here. This film changed the horror genre in America forever.",8
11 December 2020,Still as freaky today.,"What a film. Seeing this now after a few views it just gets better. I love Hitchcock, and this is one his best. Psychological this is a scary film and a good insight into a psycho. Well worth a watch.

25 September 2001,A Dark look into the mind of a mad man,"Norman Bates is the mad man here, and to take a look into his life, is very, very scary. Psycho is Hitchcock's masterpiece. For anyone to come up with a story like this is genius. I fell in love with this movie the moment i saw it, was when i was 12 years old. I wanted to make a movie like this so bad. Then i realized i wasn't that talented. This movie is a great suspense, because when you watch this movie, you try to put all the pieces together, but you just can't do it, and get an answer so different from what you thought. In the beginning of this movie , when i was watching it for the first time, i thought Janet Leigh was the mother, but boy oh boy was i wrong ( and stupid ). I used to have a crush on Anthony Perkins when i first saw this movie, then after the movie was done, the crush was gone. Straight up this movie is A MUST SEE, and if you did not see this movie, you don't know what you are missing out of. It's wonderfully done and what really amazes me is how old this movie is, and how no other movie has beaten this movie in the scariest film category of all- time. I give this movie ***** out of ***** stars, because this is a classic.",10
19 August 2023,Beyond the Shower Curtain,"Psycho stands as an iconic masterpiece that forever reshaped the horror genre and solidified Alfred Hitchcock's status as a cinematic maestro. His deliberate pacing transforms even the simplest scenes into suspenseful landscapes, each movement building an aura of dread that clings to the audience long after the final credits have rolled. The monochromatic palette and minimalist visuals serve as a canvas upon which the complex hues of human psychology are painted, drawing viewers into a world where the sinister and the subconscious intertwine.

Hitchcock's propensity for psychoanalysis is an innovation that was indeed groundbreaking during its time. However, in this era of nuanced storytelling, the film's reliance on Freudian concepts and symbolism occasionally overshadows the art of crafting a coherent plot. Hitchcock's fascination with the psychological underpinnings of his characters is undeniable, yet the heavy-handed application of psychoanalysis risks diverting attention from the central narrative, leaving audiences lost amidst layers of symbolism and interpretation.

Moreover, in an age where modern cinema is teeming with a plethora of influences drawn from Psycho, we must question whether the film's impact has somewhat mellowed over time. The plot twists and revelations, ingeniously shocking for audiences of its era, might register differently today, amid the era of sequels, adaptations, and remakes that followed Hitchcock's groundbreaking creation. The palpable tension that once hung in the air like a taut violin string may now encounter audiences armed with knowledge and expectation, potentially diminishing the film's ability to elicit the same raw, unfiltered reactions.

To be sure, these perspectives don't diminish the film's legacy but add layers to the discourse surrounding it. For just as Hitchcock layered symbolism onto the silver screen, so too can we, the viewers, build layers of understanding through diverse interpretations.",8
17 December 2015,A woman tries to attain money but ends up in a bad situation.,"For a black and white film, this was extremely well done. The lighting and contrast was perfect and really set the mood for a good film. It wasn't too bright or too dark and it outlined characters faces and the blood during the ""violent"" scenes. The camera was great when shooting at different angles. Especially in dramatic scenes, the camera would focus in and out of the scenes to add more flare to the subject and take long shots. I felt like the meaning behind the movie wasn't that strong because it was just a ""horror"" film. Behind it, though, there was definitely a hint of mistrust and deceit. It kind of showed that psychos are everywhere , no matter where you go and that you should be very careful in going to new places and with strangers because they could not be who they say they are. Acting was okay and some scenes you could tell were really fake but a good film overall.

13 June 2005,"psycho, falsified","now that Alfie is dead we can say that this movie was a complete rip off.

It is a copy of a film totally the same, but called ""Van Buren"" from Holland, produced in the late 1930's by a little known director named Hans Guberschmidt

I am sure many of you have wanted to vent your feelings and now is the time to do so.

I can arrange for a private screening of ""Van Buren"" if anyone would like to see the real ""psycho"".

Thank you for your time

26 June 2002,The best film I have ever critiqued in film class!,"""Psycho"" is one of the best films I have ever seen! After seeing the updated version twice I thought watching it in film class would be boring. But when I began to hear the music in the beginning play and the plot started to unfold I found myself shutting my eyes and jumping out of my seat still. This movie is full of twists and turns that keep you wondering what is going on. Why I like this film? Well there are many points. Alfred Hitchcock puts in so many little details that are noticable and not noticeable that make it interesting to look for the little things. The plot never gets dull, the characters all are formed correctly and their stories make sense. In the end it all comes together in a sensible way which is a big plus for films when I watch them. The movies music and camera style is intense and gave me the creeps. Hitchcock really new what he was doing when he made this film. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and you still can find new and intresting things. And it will haunt you still!!

27 December 2007,The best film that I have ever seen including thoses to Hitchcock films,"I have completed almost % 60 of IMDb's top 250 list and it may be big talk but as I said above this is the best film that I have ever seen. I read lots of comments related to it, but almost nobody emphasizes the conversations that psychiatrist made. This is why I praise as it is in title. Most people say that the scenes like that bathtub hole or murderer with knife make it enormous. I agree with the people who think like that but in fact there is a more important scene that you watch breathless. These scenes are that the psychiatrist made inferences from Norman Bates' view and words. I will never forget these scenes.

According to the story, Marion Crane works in an estate agent and she is wanted to deposit 40.000 $. Crane doesn't return to the agent. Everybody believe that Crane runs away with his friend Sam Loomis but the truth isn't like that. Crane starts to stay in Bates Hotel that takes part in the way that goes to his friend's town. Afher even her sister lost the connection with her, a detective starts to search for her but he disappears like her, too.

A man who has two personality that he switch one of them spontaneously. This man is Norman Bates that makes history in cinema by Hitchcock. If your list lacks this masterpiece like me, complete it the shortest time as you can.

Quite impressive tension scenes and of course together with sounds, inferences made by the psychiatrist, scenes that make you ask Bates' mother all these are unforgettable about Psycho.

My admiration to Hitchcock increases step by step. Thanks a lot for all of them.",10
7 March 2003,The Fruits of a Fatherless Society,"`Momma's boy!' I remember the taunt from grade school, directed at introverted and overly sensitive boys who had little athletic vigor. Momma's boys were always objects of social opprobrium, because they were exceptions to the rule.

Or were they? At the time that Hitchcock directed Psycho, Western society had been through several industrial revolutions, which removed the father from the traditional household industry, so that the sons received their fathers' discipline, not their teaching. And, lacking initiation rituals that removed older boys from their mothers and initiated them into the society of other men, most young men were insecure in their manhood, momma's boys who were wannabe men. Unlike the archetypal hero of Norse mythology, who stole the key to the wild man's cage from under his mother's pillow in order to free him, these men had never released the wild man from within themselves, from their mothers' control.

And that's why Psycho is so terrifyingly brilliant: it taps into the hidden fears of a society in which young men enter adulthood overly attached to, and overly socialized by, their mothers. Psycho illustrates the hidden dangers of a fatherless Western society.

Norman Bates, for example, the disturbed young man of Psycho, has twelve cabins, all empty. They represent his masculine development, perhaps even the twelve labors of Hercules, all of which have been usurped by his mother. He's content to leave the cabins unused, changing the sheets once a week, watching the sun rise and set every day without incident. He's totally emasculated by over attachment to his mother. Never having released the wild man, he's incredibly passive; but, his passivity is precisely why he's also a homicidal maniac. He's sensitive and overly delicate, unable to mention the toilet to a woman. If he had any male friends, he wouldn't be able to belch or fart in front of them. But his sexuality is so repressed that, when it breaks forth to the surface, it manifests itself as the fear of voyeurism or the angry control of violence. Is it a coincidence that, at the time the film was made, the larger society as a whole was becoming obsessed with pornography, which offers both voyeurism and the false empowerment of imaginary control? Is Norman Bates an aberrant microcosm of the rest of us? Is that why his character is so scary?

Watch it for yourself, and decide for yourself. This is one hell of a classic.",
29 October 2017,Virginia Gregg and Jeanette Nolan,"Both of these women did the voice of Mrs. Bates in the movie, ""Psycho"". Both had considerable radio training. Ms. Gregg played ""Kitty"" on the radio version of Gunsmoke and also Miss Wong on the radio version of Have Gun Will Travel. Ms. Nolan played a witch several times in television and even did Lady Macbeth in the movie version of Macbeth. Her husband was John McIntyre who played the sheriff in the movie, Psycho, and his wife was played by Lureen Tuttle, who played Effie, Sam Spade's secretary on radio. McIntyre had the classic line of asking John Gavin (Sam Loomis) who claimed Mrs. Bates was still alive. McIntyre told him that Mrs. Bates had died years before and if someone had seen her in the upstairs window, ""then who was that woman buried out in Greenwood cemetery."" That is when people might start getting suspicious of the outcome.

13 May 2016,Masterfully directed nail-biting horror,"Hitchcock really is brilliant. I could predict the plot from a mile away, but I still felt suspense and shock in nearly every scene. Even the smallest moments, like Marion unpacking her things or being stopped by a police officer, had me scared. I feared for the danger of the innocent lives, but in a way, I also felt the fear of the killer's private details being exposed as well.

I like how Psycho initially tries to be one kind of movie and then startles the viewer once it develops into an entirely different animal. With the ending in mind, I'm compelled to go back and re-watch it to find small details I missed. It's a low budget movie, but every little humble scene packs an enormous amount of weight to it.

29 April 2003,The best suspense/horror ever - Spoilers.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",

28 June 2021,Still mesmerizing!,"Always watch this when it is showing. I remember when I was a kid hearing my mom talking about this film especially the shower scene. I knew I would have to see it at some point. Eventually saw it on tv years later and it didn't disappoint. And it still doesn't to this day. In 2015 it was on the big screen as part of a Fathom Events series and I had to see it in this form. So I took my youngest daughter with me who had never seen it. She was gripping her seat throughout. And this was a kid who grew up watching 80s slasher films. Mission accomplished. This movie is the template for those slasher movies. In the first scene it is obvious that Marion (Janet Leigh) and Sam (John Gavin) are in a sordid relationship. In that later genre this seals her fate. And her sister Lila (Vera Miles) is the original ""Last Girl"". The story is superb. Great acting ( although John Gavin is mediocre) especially Anthony Perkins as Norman . The black-and-white cinematography escalates the creepiness effect. And the music score? Even people who have never seen this film are familiar with it. The camera effects outstanding. The shots when Vera Miles approached the house to confront Mrs. Bates. As for my daughter, the climactic scene in the fruit cellar freaked her out. I would say that is great filmmaking.",10
27 November 2010,"Visually impressive, but doesn't hold up.","While I know I'll anger a lot of thriller fans, here's my two cents: this is one of the least enjoyable Hitchcock classics. To clarify: if you compare Psycho to North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train, Vertigo or Rebecca, I can't see how any self-proclaimed film fan wouldn't conclude that it falls considerably short. Even other Hitch classics I don't particularly love or hate (such as The Birds, Rear Window or Marnie) trigger a wider emotional response than the pretty simplistic shock effects which are all Psycho has to offer. Of course there's some great cinematography, but it isn't backed by any involving factors other than sheer horror, or the kind of hammy pseudo-psychology Hitchcock already tried his hand on in Spellbound.

My reasonably kind rating of seven out of ten is mostly motivated by its historical importance - even if you take into account that Peeping Tom, which I think is a far superior film with a similar theme, relentlessly flopped earlier in the same year - as it opened the mainstream public's eyes regarding the horror/thriller genre. But if you've seen Psycho once (which, in fact, any film fanatic should), to me there's no real reason to watch it again.",7
15 June 2019,"The ""MOTHER "" superior of horror !","This original classic manages to cross genres its a sublime mix off horror/thriller and its probably regarded as one of the best films of all time. Marion crane, a secretary steals 100,000 from her employer and goes on the run , she accidently stumbles upon the BATES MOTEL and she is welcomed by a kindly motel manager with a hidden agenda and a few skeletons in the closet, The film is the first of 4 movies psycho 2 (1983) psycho 3 (1986) psycho 4 the beginning (1990) this original is definately the best in the series if not in the thriller or horror genre 8.5 groundbreaking ! This film will never be forgotten

28 September 2017,"""we all go a little mad sometimes""","Alfred Hitchcock was considered a master of suspence and Psycho was considered his masterpeice of all of his work and it has been considered one of the best that he has directed in his carrer and i would agree with people who say that. Psycho follows Marion Crane a asssistant who after getting a whole lot a cash from one of her bosses customers ends up running away and eventuallu running apon the bates motel on her travels and from there her fate is sealed. Janet Leigh is Marion Crane our leading lady through Psycho and she has such a iconic role that it has cemented her in pop culture forever and she is amazing and one of my favorite scenes with her is when she is in the car and she is thinking of all of the senarios of what people say after she goes missing and her facial expressions are perfect for describing what she is thinking in her head. Anthony Perkins is Norman Bates and he has one of the scariest preformaces in cinema as the errie owner of the motel who is haunted by his over protective mother and she is a looming part of his life and even in facial expressions alone this guy can be scary and one of the best parts of this movie.the cast also has amazing supporting stars like Vera Miles,John Gavin, Martin Balsam, john McIntire and Simon Oakland the cast that is more supporting is also as good as the main two stars who get plently pf screen time. Psycho is by far my Favorite Hitchcock movie Psycho plays on peoples fears and also makes some afried of going in the shower and that was only thought of because of Psycho and it is one of those moves that has become so iconic that it's a movie that is a must watch for horror fans and for any movie buff or general movie watcher and i would recommend it as it is a Hitchcock movie that lot's of people were talking about and still haven't stopped talking about and that is why i rate Psycho 10/10 it is supurb",10
18 April 2014,Black and white thriller,"When i was younger i believed that there is no way a black and white thriller to be good enough. My brother always told me to watch Psycho but i was like: An old movie like that, NO!!! One day i watched it and i was like wow that is a masterpiece, i could not believe that a black and white movie could make me love it so much. The plot is flawless, it makes you anxious and satisfied in the end. The bathroom scene (which is one of the most famous scenes worldwide) was amazing. Anthony Perkins interpretation was so good. I am a huge fan of movies that conclude crazy main characters. To those who hasn't seen it yet i recommend to choose one rainy night and watch it. Also i believe that psycho is one of the must see thrillers such as Stanley Kubrics: The Shinning, Hide and Seek, Lost in Highway and the others.

21 August 2009,Psycho!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
24 February 2014,"Best psychological thriller, a true Hitchcock Masterpiece","To me Psycho is the best movie from the master of thrill and suspense Alfred Hitchcock. It has everything that makes a thriller perfect, the start is a bit different from the plot but that is what making psycho even more beautiful, the tension in Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind weather to steal and run away or remain loyal, the free way scene with cop following her and then her entry to the BATES Motel, the main concern of the movie, Everything is shot to perfection. The music never gets better, it sounds to be created specially to scare you. Norman Bates has a very special characteristic in his character and no one could have played him better but Anthony Perkins. Hang on guys, because no one is going to relieve himself of the great tension from start lasting through the entire movie up till the final frame. Anthony Perkins is the reason why you are never gonna feel out of the movie for even a second, and you never forget him even after watching this flick. It's not an ordinary horror film because everything makes sense, a mother's love is eternal.

Alfred Hitchcock has proved himself to be the cinematic icon, He manages to catch you through his characters in every film he has made, While this one being the best of all.",9

22 April 2023,This Puppy Did Not Age Well. Plenty of Manufactured (too long) Drama...,"""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.

I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending.

The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.

The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.

Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.",4
12 August 2003,It ain't for kids,"Psycho ain't for kids. Not because of the much celebrated shower scene, but because it asks something of its audience that a lot of children haven't developed yet.

Hitchcock takes all the time in the world introducing us to the world of Marian Crane (Janet Leigh) before the bottom falls out of reality. And there's the real horror. This poor fool wallows into a trap of her own making, wanders into another set for her by the amazingly weird Norman Bates, played intently by Anthony Hopkins.

After the prime horror of the story is completed, no one can do anything. Not the detective Arbogast, not the handsome but useless boyfriend, no one, because the prime horror was committed long before Marian Crane ever stepped into that shower, and it came out of the excesses of the nuclear family. But you're in Hitchcock land now, and what seems clear, beautiful and all-American is hiding a deep corruption steeped in fear of sex and death, and that is heavy indeed.

A film like this reeks of a certain conscious angst, which is perhaps why the full color remake of a few years ago was so presumptuous. Psycho works because we have Robert Bloch and Alfred Hitchcock playing out some of the darkest realms of the subconscious in black and white. It is we, the audience, who add the color, in this dream that surrounds the dream. No color remake can ever hope to attain the same effect.

In the meantime, this tight horror film stands, not only in its own time, but for the foreseeable future.",
30 December 2013,I wont even harm a fly....,"A secretary steals 40,000 dollars from a client and goes on the run, only to end up at the Bates Motel. Enter Norman Bates a man with a devious side to him who is controlled by his domineering mother.

One of the most classic and shocking films for its time, and directed by the master of suspense. Hitchcock to this day is still considered one of the greatest film directors of all time and it is easily believable as you watch his direction through photography, lighting and pacing. Psycho is one if not his most revered film. The pacing and the tension grow with each passing minute and for the first time viewer one truly has no idea what to expect, other than the growing feeling that something isn't right. Shocking for its time, and with a twist ending that in this day and age may be easy to figure out but for its time truly took the viewer for a surprise. With a famous score that anyone who hears it will instantly recollect this film. One of the most famous scenes in all of cinema as well, the infamous shower scene. Psycho is a an unsettling film though ages in many aspects still a cinematic treasure that any fan of film can enjoy, as it is in my opinion a timeless classic.",8
23 August 2022,I feel weird???,"Is there something I missed or did it so happen I was to tired to properly enjoy this movie? I had heard so many great things about this movie so I thought I would enjoyed it more. Instead I almost fell asleep 6 times. The twists for me at least were easily predictable and I already knew the famous shower scene. Maybe I should re-watch in a few years and I may enjoy it more. Or maybe I expected more? Maybe I thought the movie would deliver more than what it had to give? There are hundred of thousands of reviews on this movie and almost everyone rates it high for once I feel special.

17 November 2003,In a way that only Alfred Hitchcock can...he rocked my world,"It was a little weird when I sat down to watch Psycho for the first time a few hours ago. Being a fan of horror films, I've been told by everyone that this was the one I have to see. Talk about a reputation to live up to, I didn't honestly see how it could be as good as it was supposed to be. I recently had been hearing great things about A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum', and was disappointed in that, so my solely-based-on-reputation expectations were a little shot, plus I'd heard so much about the shower scene I figured that was the big payoff. Well, in a way that only Alfred Hitchcock can do it, any expectations I had were not only met but shattered. I cannot imagine the impact this movie must have had on audiences in 1960, even watching it forty years later on my DVD player with the volume turned down he rocked my world. If you're someone who hates top 200 lists because they're usually all the same, ignore the fact that this on every one and give it a chance, it honestly deserves any attention it's got over the years. All of the acting is solid, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is believable in his difficult role and Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) gets scared with the best of em. The soundtrack is perfect, and there's some great cinematography in a few of the more dramatic moments, making Psycho' close to a perfect horror film. I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and say that if you haven't seen this movie yet, stop what you're doing and go rent it/buy it/steal it, whatever you need to do to watch it. Rating: 34/40",9

The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
15 December 2011,The absolute pinnacle of Hitchcock's genius!!!,"My appreciation for this film has really gone through the roof! From the first time I saw it (maybe 8 years back) I knew it was my favorite Hitchcock. But after rewatching and totally being thrilled by NORTH BY NORTHWEST a few months ago I started to wonder if NBNW isn't almost as good as PSYCHO. Well, it's not. This most recent rewatch confirmed it. As great as NBNW is (oh believe me - it's great!!) PSYCHO is that much better. Far and away the best Hitch!! And almost everything that disturbed me about HALLOWEEN and made me look away from it I was drawn into and totally mesmerized by in PSYCHO. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is one of the most brilliant creations in film history! His conversation with Janet Leigh in the parlor is sooooo engaging that you're literally sitting there with your mouth agape. And need anyone say anything about the infamous shower scene?? Plus the B&W cinematography combined with Bernard Herrmann's amazing score really sets the creepy/paranoid mood of the film - sends shivers down your spine. Brilliant stuff!!

30 April 2002,`What are you running away from?',"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue"").

12 October 2007,Weird.. they didn't win Oscars..,"This is probably one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and I watch movies as often as I can. A woman steals some money from her work and runs away with it. She goes to the Bates Motel, where she meets Norman Bates. A psycho.

This is Alfred Hitchcock's best work and I think that he should have, at least, been nominated for best picture, cause this truly is an amazing film.

Janet Leigh was good, at least the whole forty-five minutes she was in the film until she got whacked... But the really weird thing is that Anthony Perkins did not win an Oscar for his role, a very difficult role to play I might add, as the psycho who kills his own mother and kills Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) in the shower. That was some scary stuff.

This is one of the greatest films ever made and it's absurd that the academy would give Oscars to let's say Denzel Washington for Training Day, and not to Perkins or Hitchcock. I mean yeah, it's been 40 years, but still! Well, good job Perkins for giving us one of the greatest performances ever in the history of film.",10
30 October 2008,Hitchcock...At His BEST !!!!!,"WOW!!! this is undoubtedly one of the greatest horror film of all time!! this film is not overrated...it deserves to be in the top 100 movie... but i really think it is unfair for other horror movie like exorcist and the omen...i think those two movies are the best horror movie of all time!! this movie could be rank as no 3 in my horror movie list...

Anthony Perkins proves he is one of the most greatest psychotic actor ever!!! Vera Miles and Janet Leigh have proved themselves as one of the greatest actress in history!!i think Anthony Perkins should be nominated an Oscar for this film...i wouldn't want to say anything more about this movie...judge it by yourselves!

watch PSYCHO (1960)!! psycho 2 and 3 are okay...but not a masterpiece...i don't know about psycho 4..BUT...AVOID THE REMAKE !!!

Overall...i give this 10/10*** :)",10

19 March 2002,Two cents,"I know a lot of comments have been offered up for this movie but seeing as this is my favorite movie of all time, I figured I need to toss my two cents is as well.

In my opinion this is movie perfection. From the beginning you know that Marion is (for 1960) a rather unscrupulous woman, but you like her. Albeit a poor decision-maker, she's strong and courageous. You follow her along through her folly, wondering, `Will she get away with it?' Will she come to her senses?' And when she finally does with the help of poor, lovable, goofy Norman, the whole thing takes a twist that you could never have seen coming from a movie made back then. The cinematography is excellence, I have yet to see it's like again. The remake made a great attempt but it just didn't feel the same. The performances are as pure as Ivory soap. This is the one movie that I can sit through time and again and it only makes me love it more. The man was a genius and obviously at the top of his craft here. That's my take. What's yours?

18 September 2006,Witness a master filmmaker at work,"The second most suspenseful and compelling film I've ever seen (just behind Jonatahn Mostow's outstanding but heavily underrated ""Breakdown"") Psycho is a true classic and is rightly hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. The story is so simple and easy to follow, but Hitchcock brilliantly uses the late Joseph Stefano's screenplay to squeeze every bit of nerve and suspense out of the viewer (most notably in the two death scenes).

The performances are all terrific, but the standout performance belongs to Perkins offering one of the most chilling portrayals your ever likely to see on screen.

If you haven't seen this yet you're truly missing out on a great piece of cinema. Watch it now! 10/10

23 January 1999,Possibly the best use of the director's ability to manipulate the audience in film history,"Check out Franscois Truffaut's classic book ""Truffaut On Hitchcock"" for some terrific insights into this film. Hitch really was convinced he has made a really dark comedy. Obviously, what he had really managed to do was create several long lasting American icons.

22 June 2000,Psycho (1960),"I would prefer going back to 1960 to watch this movie. ( I was only 2 at the time) Knowing who the killer was took alot of the mystery out. Overall it was a great movie for its time. Alfred did his best not only in directing this movie but by his ingenious method of not allowing people to view the movie after it had started.

Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",6
4 April 2019,THE MOVIE THAT STARTED IT ALL,"I've never heard about the movie, ""psycho"" til my teacher made us watch it. The movie was great and a very over the edge movie. Alfredo Hitchcock did an amazing job not going stepping too much over the line. Very good screenplay, acting, camera shots. This must be hitchcock's most best film. i feel like if hitchcock was alive today he would still have one of the best movies in the industry, especially since everything is different now from it was back then. i'm glad that i got to watch this film cause i learned a lot from hitchcock. i would recommend this movie for any of my peers or family. i would watch this movie over and over again for its that good.

5 May 2019,A Descent Into Madness,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially.

17 June 2003,A new face to horror! Make that two!,"Psycho is the best Hitchcock movie I had ever seen! Psycho displays Norman Bates who owns the Bates Motel and is having trouble with his mother. Marion Crane stays at the Bates Motel for a good night's rest. When she takes a shower, there's mother with a knife!! The ending is something you never expected!!

WARNING!!WARNING!!WARNING!! IF YOU HAD NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE, DO NOT READ THIS STATEMENT!!IT WILL RUIN THE ENDING FOR YOU!!

We find out the Norman Bates is his own mother! He murdered his mother and her lover when he was young and won't let anyone get near her corpse. Great horror movie! I liked Psycho II.

6 September 2010,A Horrifying Work of Art,"By today's standards, the murder scenes are laughable, but I know that back in 1960, this movie was terrifying.

Alfred Hitchcock is definitely a master. The way that he used music and editing made some scenes really frightening to me. I feel like the music was the most effective way that Hitchcock got into my head and stressed me out. Even in some scenes where nothing was happen, that music came on and I was scared. I was grabbing onto my friend and biting my fingers. The night after I watched this, I had to lock my door, check my bathroom for a hidden creep, and think of happy things until I fell asleep. It left a lasting impression on me, definitely. The conclusion is insane! It is a freaky film.

The actors were great, minus the murder scenes. They were calm when they had to be, scared when they had to be, and creepy as hell when they had to be. I will never see the remake of this film, because I really doubt that anybody could ever fulfill these roles better than Perkins and Leigh did.

Hitchcock really knows which angles to use, what editing techniques work, all the things that make this a good movie. The content is scary, the form is excellent. I completely understand why this film is iconic, why it has been brought up so often in society. This is the movie that made motels kind of creepy places, I bet.

I would buy this movie, sure. It's recommended. It's great studying material for a budding filmmaker, so it should be in my collection sometime soon. : )",9

21 March 2007,Slightly dated but none the less effective film,"I'm not afraid to admit a few small portions look a little silly by today's standards, however overall I was surprised that despite film being well over 40 years old, is still more effective then any horror film released within the past decade.

A quick synopsis of the plot for the uniniated:Marion Crane has sucsessfully stolen 40,000 dollars from her boss. Going off on her own, some bad weather forces her to stop at the Bates hotel, which should be an uneventful night before getting back on track. However there is nothing uneventful about what she's going to go through...

Yes, this film is over 40 years old. Yes, this film does look dated in a few small areas. However despite all this Psycho was still, to me frightening. I first watched it on TV and thought it a well done thriller. Having watched it in movies class again, I couldn't believe how much the film had scared me. The now infamous shower scene(infamous to the point it's not even a spoiler), although looking a little dated, frightened me. A lot of it had to do with the music. The music and clever camera angles make this very effective, especially the music. Despite all the sppofs where you hear the music, this is the only time the music proves effective. Also acting ranging from competent to, in Perkins case great, helps the film along as well.

In today's age where exploitation films have gone from an underground genre to commercial and mainstream, films like Psycho will always produce more fear then all the Saw and Hostel films put together.

10 April 2001,"the best hitchcock film surpasses rebecca, notorious, and north by northwest by far","before i first watched psycho, i had a vague idea of what it was about. actually i didn't. i knew that janet leigh got stabbed while she was taking a shower. that's all. so i knew nothing, because that's public knowledge. like if a psychiatrist says psycho you say shower. well it was ten at night in the height of summer and i was laying down to go to sleep when my mom said scott come here! i went down to the living room just in time to see the black and white almost generic credits roll by. i thought what is this? my mom wouldn't tell me so i just sat down. as soon as i saw janet leigh i knew what it was. so before the movie progressed too far, i got some popcorn and pop and strapped myself in for the ride. i didn't know what i was in for. as soon as leigh turned on the water, i looked at my mom and she was asleep. i woke her up, knowing that there was no way in heck that i was watching the first ever graphic murder scene complete with the screeching violins of bernard herrman alone. and i thought the shower scene was bad! the second murder and the final attempted murder at the end resulted in strewn popcorn all over my living room floor! i was scared out of my mind. just when i thought i had made it through this roller coaster of a movie, i saw anthony perkins in a jail cell at the end thinking. it wasn't bad until norman looked down at a fly crawling on his hand. this was the scariest part in the movie i think. so now its twelve thirty in the morning im the only one awake in the house and my room is upstairs and to the left. i wasn't going to bed. the only fault with this movie is that i think it ruined anthony perkins career because he never was able to escape norman bates. but this movie is incredible. excellent twists in the plot, first rate soundtrack, an excellent cast, and of course, the masterful direction of hitchcock make this film one of two perfect films that i have seen in my life (the other one being Remember the Titans)",
17 January 2019,A mixed bag,"When I began this film I went in with the notion that it couldnt be scary and was underwhelmed about 30 mins in, but hitchcock being a master of audio scared the hell out of me with nothing more than sound and prescence. Such a simple yet effective jumpscare.

19 August 2013,Must be Psycho for not Loving It,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
26 April 2015,Wow,"What more can be said about Psycho other than 'WOW'. Psycho isn't just an iconic horror film, it's an icon completely as an item and a piece of art. The film that cemented Hitchcock's star in the hall of cine-fame, Psycho narrates the infamous story of Norman Bates and his warped motel, inhabited by the elusive silhouette of his over-bearing mother. When a beautiful young runaway flees work with a chunk of her employer's money, of course her first thought is to check into the nearest motel, inevitably leading to one of the most notoriously scary scenes in cinema. Worth a watch in all kinds of weather, the film was nominated for four Academy Awards upon release and features a young Janet Leigh and a handsome Anthony Perkins. Scary, extremely tense and mildly psycho-sexual, Psycho is great.

16 October 2013,HUH. so predictable.,"considering this was in the top 250 of IMDb its hard to not watch this movie. i was expecting great things and what not. but alas it was disappointing in every way imaginable. may be it was something amazing or different in 60's but today it is just another predictable movie which wont impress today's audience. Just after the first murder i predicted its ending and not to my surprise the ending was just as predicted by me (trying not to write any spoilers) ..why its in top 30 movies is just beyond me. maybe only old people are rating these movies. and there might be a lot of them.

so yeah. its just not that thrilling or horrifying or anything it claims for today's audience. i am breaking the DVD right now.

8 September 2017,An Undisputed Masterpiece,"Ever since I was a kid, I always loved watching vintage horror movies. When I got older, my mom started telling us more and more about Alfred Hitchcock's movies and invited us to watch as many as we could. If my memory serves, the very first two Hitchcock movies that I ever watched were ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds."" Like Stephen King after him, Hitchcock made you unable to trust your surroundings, whether it be something simple like a motel or just walking down the street and see a group of birds sitting on power lines.

What angers me about this is that it was poorly remade later on and it just didn't have the same type of scares as the first one. You do not need a horror movie to be in color to have it be scary. ""Psycho"" was done exclusively in black and white and that's all there was to it. If something like this can scare you once, it can certainly scare you again no matter how many times you watch it. ""Psycho"" is definitely a masterpiece that no matter how many times you try to do it, you cannot duplicate it. It has been parodied many times on TV shows and music videos, which goes to show that people will keep coming back to it to get the daylights scared out of them.

In the end, let me say this: if it isn't broke, don't fix it. If you want to truly be scared out of your wits and be paranoid about checking into a motel, watch this.",10

2 June 2004,A masterwork by the master of suspense,"Oft-cited as one of the top horror movies of all time, along with such fare as ""Jaws"" and ""Alien"", ""Psycho"" is Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known film. Why would this one film, made before the peak of his career, come to be the most famous? It's simple: Hitchcock was at his best when he toyed with audiences' expectations, and ""Psycho"" did that in a big way.

Viewers in the 1960's were not as jaded and suspicious when they waled into theaters as they are today. Now, people try to guess the endings of M. Night Shyamalan movies before the first hour is up, whereas the audiences of Hitchcock's time were more passive. Hitchcock took advantage of this quality by establishing a seemingly unstable character -- the titular psycho -- only to force us later on to question who was really most deserving of that dubious honor.

The plot is simple: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a struggling office worker, carrying on a relationship with a man she knows can't support her. Faced with these pressures and an opportunity to change them, she steals $40,000 from her workplace and goes on the run. She stops at the Bates Motel, a forgotten little establishment strapped for visitors ever since the highway was diverted elsewhere. The caretaker there is Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a charming young man who exudes an aura of strange intensity. It is there at the motel that the fate of Marion and her stolen money will be decided, by forces outside her control. The nature of those forces is not truly revealed until the last minutes of the film, in what was an truly outrageous ending for a movie of the 60's.

The performances of the main characters are very good, with special attention being paid to Anthony Perkins. Perkins never got another major role after his turn as the conflicted Norman Bates; his stellar performance in ""Psycho"" cementing him in audience's minds as a certain kind of character actor. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane acts just as you would expect a desperate and paranoid criminal on the run to. The supporting cast is capable, with the exception of Marion's love interest, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). He comes off as the typical, brutish boyfriend type, a one-note character with little to do other than exist in various stages of outrage.

The camerawork in ""Psycho"" is exceptional, especially considering the tools available to Hitchcock at the time. The long zoom in to the room where Sam and Marion are meeting is phenomenal for a 60's movie, as is the way Hitchcock stages the infamous ""shower scene"" that so scared the public. As in the aforementioned classic horror movies, Hitchcock deftly hides his ""monster"", his ""psycho"", allowing us only brief glimpses at it to let the tension and suspense to build. Perhaps the ultimate failing of ""Psycho"" is in its lasts minutes, when the unmasking of the true ""psycho"" leaves audiences over-saturated with information when they had so long been left in the dark. There is such a thing as ""too much information"", and the end of ""Psycho"" suffers for it.

""Psycho"" is and will continue to be remembered as the seminal Hitchcockian film, whether it is his best or not (I, for one, find ""Rear Window"" to be a better film). With the way Hitchcock played the movie-going audience of his time, it is little wonder why this is. As long as people crave an intelligent, suspenseful horror movie as a respite from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""-style gorefests, ""Psycho"" can be assured of its firm place in the cinematic cosmos.",
2 November 2020,Pretty good,"I think this was an over all good movie, i usually don't like these types of movies but this one was actually interesting and finds a way to keep you hooked on the end of your seat. Though i do not think it should be rated R, i would say this movie is more pg-13 rated instead of R.

17 November 2008,May be because I do not usually watch horror movies,"I sat to watch this movie with a lot of expectation, since it is ranked among the top 20 of all time and was directed by Hitchcock. Usually I enjoy both the dialogs and visuals from a Hitchcock movie but in this the only dialog I remember was during the start'He was flirting with you, he must have noticed the ring on my hand'. On the visual side however the noticeable, innovation (must have been at that time) was the height at which the house (of the Norman) was located, it must have been the camera angle too, that every time you look at it, it gives you a spooky feeling, so just the angle did it! The concept of the movie however is the thing that has taken it to the top of the list (I guess), which has been used in several movies by now but must have been a novelty at that time. The lead actor's performance is the best in the movie, even though in the starting one might think that it can't be him, it must be the lady herself or her lover but this guy gets into the frame perfectly and unfolds himself with each dialog. On the whole a good movie but Rear window still remains my favorite Hitchcock movie.

22 April 1999,"True ""Horror""","Just saw Psycho for the first time and I thought it was an excellent horror film. Now those of you who haven't seen the original don't be confused or misled by the word ""horror."" Most people today when they hear the word horror think of the likes of Jason or Freddy or Dracula hacking and biting people to a bloody pulp and leaving us with a very gross looking corpse on the the screen and a sick twisting feeling in our stomachs. Horror, according to the dictionary, means a state of suspense or tension; unfortunately, today one can't call a movie a horror film without gore. When people today for the first time see Psycho think that this movie isn't scary enough or gory enough to be considered horror. I must admit that I was at first trapped into that state of mind, but then I soon realized that Psycho is not a horror in the sense of gore or fright factor, but a horror in the sense that you are on the edge of your seat wanting to know what is going to happen and when it does happen you are shocked and sometimes disturbed by what has just occurred.

What adds to the mystery, suspense, and yes horror to it all is the fact that you don't know how the movie is going to end; unfortunately, I found out what the ending was going to be before seeing the movie. So I beg you all, don't tell others who haven't seen this film what the ending is going to be, because that is where I was the most scared in the entire movie. Just imagine what it would have been like if I, or anyone else, didn't know what the ending was.

We miss you Alfred.",8
1 February 2022,One of best psychological horrors ever seen,"You just can't forget that damn final part.

The whole movie is un interrogation and I couldn't really tell you the solution until the very end came. It's beautiful that this kind of films are still in people's hands.

The only thing that should have been better are the effects. I know Hitchcock wanted a film with a budget under a million dollars, but it really could have done better on that.

He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
5 March 2004,Considered Great Cinema for a Reason,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with.

21 March 2003,Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho,"Starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Simon Oakland, and Janet Leigh as Marion. 4/4, My IMDB Rating: 9.0/10. Rated R for Violence and Brief Nudity.

The now familiar plot concerns Norman Bates, a nervous, bird-like motel proprietor who lives under the domineering influence of his aged invalid mother. Norman takes care of Mother and, in return, she protects the disturbingly boyish man from temptation and corruption, particularly in the form of attractive single women who come to stay at the motel. Marion Crane stops at the Bates Motel after impulsively fleeing from her workplace with a large sum of stolen money. She had hoped this cash would allow her married lover, Sam Loomis, to marry her. After chatting with Norman, Marion appears to resolve to return the money. However, someone intervenes, leaving a bloody mess for Norman to clean up. After he's scrubbed down the bathroom, the dutiful son places the corpse in the trunk of Crane's traded car and sinks all the evidence in a nearby swamp. The situation gets tense for Norman when Marion's sister, Lila, Marion's lover, Sam, and private investigator Milton Arbogast arrive to ask some questions.

This movie is an all-time classic. Horror at it's finest. Mystery also at it's finest. Anthony Perkins was so good that I think that he should have been atleast nominated for an Academy Award. Although I thought that Psycho II was surprisingly good, I felt that Psycho III, IV, and Psycho(1998) were very inferior. Perhaps no other film changed Hollywood's perception of the horror film so drastically as did PSYCHO. Nowadays, when any psychological thriller featuring a loony with a knife is designated ""Hitchcockian"" in some quarters, it's easy to forget just what a dramatic change of pace this was for Hitchcock. A great catch of the day!",
16 October 2013,It isn't as good as its reputation...,"Marion Crane steals $400,000 from her boss, she runs away and on the road she stays in the small Bates Motel, owned by psycho Norman Bates.. I have watched this week both the original 1960 and the 1998 remake for the first time.

This movie is overrated. Anthony Perkins did a great job, but the rest of the characters were horribly acted.

The story is good, audio line matches harmoniously. But the movie is very slow It could have used some pace. Even Considering it was made in 1960.

It isn't as good as its reputation. Psycho surely builds the base of horror movies, but certainly it's not the best one. The remake is slightly better (much better acting especially from Heche compared with Janet Leigh), so if you haven't watch both, i would recommend the latter....",5
24 January 2003,"""Psycho"" is not the best of Hitchcocks movies","The most people think, that this is Hitchcocks best movie, but it is only a second class horror film. (""The Birds"" are so much better and in opposition to it - because there's the girl, who fights against the birds but Marion in ""Psycho"" had no chance.)

This film is not sophisticated or sensitive at last it is a trash movie. To murdering his mother is the most criminal act a person can do. That Marion Crane is murdered in the first twenty minutes it is a sign for the whole film... Melanie in ""The Birds"" will be living on. With the killing of the leading actor in the famous scene in the bathroom, the film stops and find never back. (You have exactly the same scene in the end of ""The Birds"", but Melanie will be saved by Mitch.)

At last: to show a skeleton of a mother with this thrill is not a part of criminal story, and leave bad taste in one's mouth. I don't like this film very much, but the music from Hermann is great.

17 February 2006,Hitchcock invents a new genre,"this is a roller-coaster ride of a scary movie. you could tell when you first hear that scary music, that something terrifying was on the way. The first half hour of the movie was kinda like a crime movie. It showed Janet Leigh stealing 40,000 dollars from her boss. then she drives far away to Touson,Arizona to find her sister. But she gets tired, so she pulls the car over and rests. In the morning she is woken up by a cop, she tries to flee. but he asks for her ID. then she goes to a car dealership, to get a new car, 'cause the same cop from before is following her. she gets a new car very quickly,and is acting very suspisicous. then she buys the car,in cash. she continues driving, but it's raining bad, she put the wipers on. but she can't at all. then she sees the big bright ""Bate's motel"" sign, and pulls over. then she checks in and the motel manager,Norman Bates, a very lonely mama's boy. he seems like a nice person, she checks in under a fake name. then Norman goes to his creepy-ass house on a hill with steps right next to the motel, to get Marion some food. Marion goes into her room and hears from the house, Norman and his mom arguing. then Norman comes down the hill with the food. then him and Marion have a talk, and he says his mom is bed-ridden. after their talk, Marion goes back to her cabin. moments later, she takes a shower, which turns out to be the most shooking and most effective scence in film. Marion gets stabbed and killed by Norman who's dressed up as his mom. Hitchcock does it so brilliantly and dosen't show a single stab, also the movie's black and white so he used chocolate that goes down the drain just like blood. Another terrifying and clever scence is when a detective goes to the Bate's house to question the mom about Marion. as he goes up the stairs, a door opens a crack, then out of nowhere comes Norman, who stabs the detective, he falls down the stairs and the camera falls with him. how you find out Bate's is the killer, is Marion's sister and Marion's boyfriend go to the motel, they never heard from the detective. they pose as a couple, and Marion's sister goes up to the house,while Marion's boyfriend questions Bates, she finds Mrs. Bates, who turns out to be dead in a chair,she screams,and up pops Norman dressed as his mother and talking in his mom's voice. he has a split personality. one of the scariest and most original films of all time. it also opened up the doors to a new horror genre,slasher. very effective!",10

When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
15 June 2022,Nice Movie...,"The movie took it for itself because the lead role is an actor I love. The thriller scenes were very good. It's a movie I can watch again and again. The acting and dialogues were very good. It's a pretty good movie for its time. Expertly.

26 February 2008,Combine Hithcock and Perkins equals masterpiece,"This was Hitchcocks first horror movie and it was one hell of a way to start. The story is very simple to follow thanks to a very impressive screenplay. The story is about Marion Crane(Leigh) how was a secretary in Arizona who's boyfriend Sam(Gavin) was in debt problems because he's getting a divorce Marion is then given $40,000 from her boss's client to put in the bank. Marion run's off with the money and plans to help her boyfriend with the money. Marion stops off at Bates motel and meets Norman Bates(Perkins). This results in Marion realising why Norman has no friends.

Anthony Perkins gives a not just Oscar worthy performance but for movie history. Vera Miles(Lila Crane) also gives a great performance. Psycho also has very good cinematography and absolutely amazing music. And as soon as you see this movie the first thing that comes to your mind is a very puzzling question. Why did this win no Oscars? The movie is almost absolutely perfect

5 April 2023,Classic Black & White,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie.

20 May 2002,In my own personal opinion,"Quite simply ""The Greatest piece of Cinema EVER""

Anthony Perkins is stunningly brilliant in this macabre and indeed, sad tale of a mother and son relationship. The bleak setting of the Bates Motel, combined with the haunting music of Bernard Herrmann make for a joyride of terror. I never ever fail to be engrossed, no matter how many times I see this movie.

Wonderful, Wonderful stuff......and Hitchcock's directing ain't bad!!!!!

30 June 2002,oh my good god,"this has to be the grandaddy of the slasher genre. quite apart from inventing the idea, it still today beats the hell out of any pap that hollywood deams worthy of release.shocking in its day, a classic in ours, forever one of my favourites.watching hitchcock at work is pure art and is a pleasure from unassuming beginning to climactic and frankly disturbing end. perkins is a true knightmare vision and the original stalker slasher that many including wes craven decided to emulate. forever, simply an amazing piece of cinema.

13 March 2002,We all go a little mad sometimes...,"We is there to say about ""Psycho"" that has not been said before. Ok, first off, this movie is genius..all the actors, and cre are genius. If you don't like this movie, you OBVIOUSLY don't know horror. Horror is not blood and guts, but the power of suspense, and thrills to control your mind. ""Psycho"" follows that pattern. First off. dont see the remake.

Don't get me wrong, I actually like the remake...but it's a chessy film, with bad acting. If you wanna see the full monty, rent the original. I havent found anyone (but my friends who only like gore horror) that dont like this movie. What's not to like, the movie is not boring at all!!!

The best part about this movie is that there are 2 plots and storylines mixed in one. M&M (Money and Mother)

I really don't want to give anything, not one thing away in this movie, cause that was Hitchcock's purpose (rent the dvd and you'll find out)

9 June 2015,A Review,"Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known film invented modern suspense the moment it opened in the cinema. As a child I recognized the iconic imagery and score years before I ever had the chance to watch the movie in its entirety. From the blend of music and cinematography, to its groundbreaking use of ""less-is-more"" violence, ""Psycho"" undoubtedly proves that what we see is far less important that we we DO NOT see. This film married Freud and Freddy, and redefined the horror genre as it is. It explores the often-complex relationship between mother and son, the dangers of cloistered sexuality, hidden desires, unexplored urges, dealing with death, loneliness, perversion, greed, lust, and the law.

28 May 2013,"Hitchcock executes suspense gracefully in 'Psycho' in a way that feels organic and raw, with every shot being memorable and iconic","I am completely at a loss of words for what to say about 'Psycho' that has not already been said before, therefore I will just reiterate what others say and that the film is all deserving of its iconic status. Every shot is memorable and when I think of either the horror or the thriller genre, the shower scene instantly comes to mind, as well as the other scenes with suspense in the film. Everything feels so meticulously placed in that the suspense hits you the same way a song approaches a bombastic crescendo.

The genre has come a long way and today's generation's expectations are more harder to please due to the market in the genre, but 'Psycho' laid out the blueprint to making a thriller that has basically become the standard and you can see it in pretty much every modern suspense film, it's ridiculous. And while this might not shake up anyone today, this definitely shook up many people and to watch it in that context really shows how far we've come in the genre today.

And with that, I think it's safe to say that Hitchcock rightfully deserves the title as 'the master of suspense.' And with other classics under his belt, such as 'Vertigo,' 'North by Northwest, and 'Rear Window,' his diversity in utilizing the concept of suspense, whether its playing with his audience's perceptions or leaving them on the edge of their seats, is evident in each of them. As a growing movie lover (my first love being music), I have to say that despite its status in pop culture lore, 'Psycho' is still a crowning achievement in what it basically is: a great movie.",8

The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",7
23 February 2006,We all go a little mad sometimes-Anthony Perkins (Psycho),"This is probably one of the most realistic films i've ever seen of the 60's Anthony Perkins delivers one of the greatest performances i've ever seen he's the best part of the movie and of course the other characters are just throw-ins for this story Joseph Stefano has extreme potential as a screenwriter if he's still alive right now Alfred Hitchcock's marvelous interepretation of Robert Bloch's novel""the Psycho"" is brilliant as the ending quite surprising is highest point of the movie the reason it din't get a full 10 from me was because of the first 30 minutes an old Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho will forever be loved by those who watch it carefully and some (very few) will relate to this movie brilliant performance by everybody especially Anthony Perkins

5 February 2022,"Not the ""masterpiece"" that people were talking about","Something most people don't know: This movie is a book adaptation. So we can't take the plot of this movie as a scoring point. We need to consider the remaining issues. Cinematography and acting.

The movie was shot in the 60's. Although it was really nice for its time, I am sure that people who are used to modern cinema while watching it today (unless they have a nostalgia fetish) will get bored. Although I find the cutscenes very successful for some reason, there is an incredible soullessness in the main scenes and the speaking scenes. This situation can be an obstacle for us to bond with the characters in the movie. But let's say that this movie was probably presented to you as a ""masterpiece"", so I'm trying to lower your expectations. Otherwise, both the intermediate and main scenes are absolutely fine.

The acting is the point that ruined the movie. Although I don't believe that people's understanding of reality was different in the 1960s, this acting made me laugh more than nervously in the famous scene of that movie. The acting in the movie (although it was considered standard at the time) is a disgrace. I am sure that everyone who has read the book has imagined everything better than this movie.

It is a movie with the limited resources and acting of the time. Everything is below average. People show great interest in this movie because of its subject, but the subject does not belong to this movie.",5
9 June 2008,Generation gap?,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman.

21 March 2014,The best horror movie from all the time,"Psycho is my favorite horror movie ever. The actors are so into the their character that it makes you believe you're there with them .From the very beginning to the end the story is more and more interesting .Alfred Hitchcock did a great job with this film ( he is a genius obviously ), the script is awesome, the soundtrack , the stars everything . I totally love Anthony Perkins character and the way he fits with it . He is a great actor and i respect him for the effort that he done to make from this movie a real legend for the horror movies lovers .If you didn't watched the movie ( OMG , how could you ?!!! ..just kidding ) , please do not read the spoilers and watch it .You will be surprised how great and in the same time scary and mysterious as hell is it. Way more better than the shitty films from 2000 - 2014 .Unique story , best characters and a little bit of black humor. Enjoy it !

2 April 2004,The original great horror movie,"'Psycho' is Alfred Hitchcock's true masterpiece. Every frame of this movie is intentional, and as a film student, I highly recommend it to any person who is interested in directing or simply in viewing movies as art instead of entertainment. Hidden within every moment, every camera angle is a metaphor or foreshadowing of what is to come.

The unusual plot structure (I will not go into details, I do not want to spoil anything) is just another reason why this movie merits at least one viewing. The acting by Anthony Perkins is stunning, bone-chilling, unforgettable. This movie scared me half to death, and the surprise ending shocked me; there is nothing predictable about 'Psycho'.

And whatever you do - do NOT compare it to the sequels or remakes. This is a masterpiece as it stands ALONE. Still, despite those unfortunate rip-offs, 'Psycho' is a classic - and for good reason.

11 August 2022,Good but not great,"Ok i know this movie came out way long time ago in 60s and that makes it a great movie of that time. But I watched it in 2022. And i have watched more better movies that were made after that. Hitchcock started it and it only got better. It's a good watch. But not the greatest. I have seen better psycho killer thrillers.

3 July 2003,Horror masterpiece.,"**** out of ****

Psycho is arguably one of the greatest movies of all time, but it without a doubt, rules its genre with an iron fist. The direction and cinematography are of the highest order. They create a dark, gritty, and claustrophobic atmosphere. This adds to the suspense, which is constantly building in every scene and never allows the viewer to look away for a moment. Also, the creepy sets make a perfect backdrop for the horror that is occurring on screen. Still, a movie cannot be complete without good performances and this movie has many of them, but it also has one great performance. Anthony Perkins is perfectly cast as Norman Bates. He is highly disturbing and obviously out of his mind, but we can't help being drawn in by his boyish charm and rooting for him through much of the movie. Which, is a perfect example of classic Hitchcock. He can manipulate you and can make you feel or believe anything he wants you to.

9 September 2007,"Intense, thrilling, a masterpiece!","One of my favourite films of all time. The intensity of the film is immense, and probably the most suspenseful movies of all time. Hitchcock should of been awarded with a medallion for this one. Definitely his best movie of all time.

Anthony Perkins plays the all time famous Norman Bates, the owner of the infamous Bates motel. A well mannered, young man who looks after his mother in his house next door.

Janet Leigh is the young, attractive, worried sibling looking for her sister after her surprising disappearance.

John Gavin is the polite and curious boyfriend of the young woman whose gone missing, he wants to do everything in his power to help track down his girlfriend.

Martin Balsam plays the detective hired by the sister and the boyfriend, a lot is clear to him, but he's still trying to work things out. He's slowly getting closer to the truth.

John McIntire is Sheriff Al Chambers, he knows a lot about his town and the people in his town. Him and his wife have been their for a while, a big source of information for the others.

All together this is the best horror movie I've seen, and one of the best over all movies. Perfect.",10
14 June 1999,"Good, but not really Classic","I'm not sure what to think about this movie. I'm sure in 1960 it was amazing and the most overwhelming experience movie viewers ever had. Now, it's too outdated to be suspenseful or scary. How can this be called a perfect movie? The acting isn't that good, first of all, and the performances feel forced. The conversation between Norman and Marion wasn't really chilling, but hard to sit through. I have to admit I like the ""mother twist"". Renting this movie about 8 months ago, I liked it better the night I watched it but have since changed my mind. I didn't know that ""mother"" was phony and was shocked at the surprise at the end, even though I knew Norman was the killer.

Is this supposed to be evidence of Hitchcock's ""genius""? The ""let's find Marion"" subplot is really dumb, and there actually is no official plot. He just made it to try and scare people. And what's with all the furor over the shower scene??? Now that isn't suspenseful at all. You probably think I'm someone who doesn't appreciate classics, but this is about the only one that doesn't cut it for me. The true mark of a classic is the ability to have the same effect a long time in the future. Citizen Kane does, this doesn't. A good film to watch, but nothing like people make it out to be.",8
17 May 2012,By far the greatest horror/suspense film of all time.,"Psycho is by far the greatest horror film of all time, and one of the earliest made horror films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect especially the famous 'shower scene'.

Visually, Hitchcock subtly represents these theories through symbolism, lighting, shapes (that reflect the characters personality) and dialogue. The most interesting and important concept that ties in with almost every other aspect of the movie are the constant metaphors that represent the psychodynamic theory of the psyche; the id - impulsive, the ego - creates realistic ways to satisfy the id's demands and the superego which is the moral compass that regulates the other two. Throughout the superego is represented in a number of ways; the policeman, the stuffed birds and Marion (just before her murder). And Norman of course represents the ego and id; although his conflict is brought to the surface through schizophrenic means. This concept that I have tried my best to explain barely scratches the surface of what is a movie jam packed with interesting analogies and metaphors. But all this complexity resonates from the focal exploration of the human mind and makes the audience question their own ethics.

There is no sloppiness in this movie in terms of a visual and aural experience, as Hitchcock's objective of 'messing' with the audience requires and almost flawless film viewing experience; an that this is.",10
23 January 2003,The Best Horror Film? No. The best suspense film? Absolutely!,"Yes, this is the greatest suspense film of all time. Yes, back in 1960 it was probably scary, but if the film is watched in modern times, the film is not too scary as it is suspenseful.

The story is exactly like Robert Bloch's novel, which was excellent, and I have now read it several times. It always makes me jump, no matter how many times I see it, and I've seen it many times now.

Includes the famous ""shower scene"" which has never been duplicated since its filming in 1960

16 June 2013,Just does not stop entertaining !,"This is my first review on IMDb and what a place to start! Psycho is one of those rare thrillers that you can watch over and over again.

The film keeps you glued to your seat throughout it's entire length. The performances are all top class. These facts are all only too well known about the film.

I don't feel it is right to put Psycho in any genre. It goes beyond all the well defined genres.

For me this movie is an experience I will never forget. If you haven't experienced it yet go for it now!

Movie Trivia: When Psycho released in theaters, viewers were not allowed inside the theater once the screening began. They had to wait for the next show to begin.",10
10 April 2014,The Best Movie ever!,"Forget about everything about horror and suspense movies. Forget everything you know about films. This is the best movie ever. A masterpiece. Norman Bates is the perfect mothers boy. The Bates Motel is the perfect and iconic place in movies. The shower scene is the perfect twist in a story. 3 Sequels, one remake, 2 television series and a million of parodies an references. And you can still have a look at the original Psycho House in the Universal Studios in California WoW. You can miss that opportunity. There are other wonderful movies, but nothing compares to Psycho. The Holly Grail of films! Tks Alfred Hitchcock, you are the best!

15 January 2009,One of the best films to come out of Hollywood,"First of all,a black and white movie is always difficult to keep the modern generation audience glued to their seats so Psycho is an exception.The script has been very cleverly written and the editing of the movie is top-notch .The performances are mind-blowing especially by Anthony Perkins.The actor so effortlessly carries off the role with innocence and confidence that he makes you stand and take notice of him.The gripping suspense intensifies with each successive frame and the shocking climax would make you stand and applaud the masterpiece.Alfred Hitchcock - The Master adds another feather to his cap after ""Vertigo"" and delivers another blockbuster with ""The Birds"".If you liked Psycho,you would definitely like the other two movies and know what an era of quality cinema ,""The Master"" has created.

1 March 2015,What a Film,"What can really be said about a classic like 'Psycho' without being entirely obvious? This amazing film remains beautifully subtle, and creepily haunting. From the set design, to the perfectly executed shower scene, to the final interrogation scene that really proves it is the average, 'normal' ones to look out for, this film is perfection. (And the 'Bates Motel' series it inspired is not too shabby, either.) Was the actor who played Norman Bates ever able to find another role after this film? I know as a director, myself, I would never be able to get past such a creepy character. And Janet Leigh? Also a brilliant actor choice. All in all, this is a brilliant film made by an insanely talented, but deeply troubled man. Regardless, though, thanks, Hitch.

1 July 2012,Review - Psycho (1960),"Psycho is a good, memorable film. I don't love it, but I do like it; it's a good piece of cinema and is notable for many things. First of all, the black-and-white cinematography is good, and it really contributes to the tone and mood of the film. There are several great camera shots and sequences. The music is good too, and it also contributes to the tone of the film, probably even more so than the cinematography. Finally, and probably most importantly, the film is noteworthy for its storytelling. Alfred Hitchcock broke several Hollywood cinema traditions of the time, and created a film that contains elements that can be easily recycled, yet at the same time is very unique, and is a good mystery horror thriller.

The story isn't all that great, but what makes it good and involving is the way it develops and unfolds. There are a lot of aspects of the movie that are not so special, and ones that have been used again and again over the years. There are some things about the movie that seem cliché, and possibly a bit cheesy. However, despite all this, after all these years, Psycho still has a uniqueness that is memorable and ultimately not copied to this day. Like I said, it's not the most extraordinary story, but it's structured in a great way. It tampers with some traditional narrative elements. It starts out seemingly normal in terms of narrative. Then, we are shocked at the movie's midpoint as Marion, our protagonist for the first half of the movie, is killed, and the course of the film is drastically changed, and what follows is a series of (like I said before) shocking discoveries and twists. The audience's expectations keep being flouted, especially in the second half of the film, especially in two major ones, the second of which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. It doesn't have great story or character complexity, but yes, it's strong.

The stark black-and-white cinematography used in the film is very good, and even further contributes the the tone of the film. Also, by far one of the most important aspects of the film is the music. Bernard Herrmann composed an excellent score for the film. The film works fine with its narrative alone, but the music really brings it all to life and supports everything. The music consisted of all string instruments, and the music is consistently dissonant and tense. The music, like everything else about the film, can be easily recycled in movies, but, like I said before, Psycho still has a level of uniqueness that really can't be matched.

Overall, it's an important landmark in the history of cinema, and it's still a good film, even to this day - not at a four-star level, but still very good. I found it to be a very good movie experience. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do.",9
23 May 2003,My favorite from the Master of Suspense,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
9 January 2015,Classic!,"We have heard a lot about this movie. A lot of side stories and a lot of prequel made as of 2015. Nothing can match the original movie and that's why its a classic. An amazing watch and I have learned a lot in dissecting this in Film school.A psycho thriller by the amazing director known as Mr. Hitchcock. Four award winning nominations including best direction. I always admire Hitchcock with the way he storyboards all of his movies and this is one great example of such. I always look up to him whenever I try and get my film together. Cinematic and one of the best films of all time. If you haven't seen this movie then you are missing out. Make sure that you put it on your movie cue.

22 March 2018,"""He wouldn't even harm a fly...""","Often referred to as the most famous and influential horror film of all time, Psycho broke down all barriers of comfort and escape when going to the pictures. With people fainting and screaming uncontrollably in their seats at the time of release, the film is still as unsettling and nerve-wrecking as it was 50 years ago, and has cemented Alfred Hitchcock as the true master of suspense.

Adapted from the significantly less successful novel from Robert Bloch, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a young attractive woman who has stolen $40,000 from the bank where she works, in order to runaway with her already-married lover. After driving all night in pouring rain, she stops at the Bates motel off the freeway for a night-in, and meets the nervous, bumbling Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is quite taken with her upon first sight. In one of the most staggering sequences in film history, she is stabbed to death while taking a shower, and as she is reported missing and people begin looking for her, the truth of Norman Bates and his 'motel' will be revealed.

Never before had the main character been brutally murdered only halfway through - let alone an attractive leading lady - and never before had such a brutal antagonist been so normal, relatable and above all, human. Beautifully shot in black and white and carried by an unforgettable score from the late Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock in all his genius draws us in with a twisted concoction of sex, murder and madness, never letting us forget even to this day that real horror may be right around the corner. All the performances are top-notch, particularly that of Perkins who as cinema's most unlikely serial killer stumbles through the film with every breath of confidence stripped from him by his overbearing invalid mother.",10

19 July 2003,Simply the Best,"It is not really necessary for ""Psycho"" to frighten viewers anymore. In 1960, it was the most terrifying film ever made, and had full houses screaming their lungs out at theaters all over the world. It was the first ""slasher movie"" and so much more. Everything in American movies changed after ""Psycho"": sex, violence, the star system. It was revolutionary. And ""Psycho"" ruled the 60's as the shocker of the decade. CBS had to cancel the TV debut in 1966 because it was too controversial. When local channels started showing it in 1967, it terrified millions more in the privacy of their own homes.

40 years-plus later, maybe ""Psycho"" will scare you, maybe it won't. But what it WILL still do is prove itself a masterpiece of filmmaking. Hitchcock and his collaborators were at top form.

Look at the editing, the composition of shots, the camera movements. Look at the unforgettable performance of Anthony Perkins as nervous young motel manager Norman Bates. Look at the unforgettable performance of Janet Leigh as motel guest Marion Crane. Look at all the great performances in support, from the millionaire at the beginning to the psychiatrist at the end. (The great overlooked performance is that of Martin Balsam as Arbogast, one smart, funny, and tenacious private detective.)

And LISTEN to Bernard Herrmann's classic score -- the greatest score ever written for a thriller. The ""screeching violins"" are the most famous motif in shocker history (only the ""Jaws"" shark theme comes close),and the ""three notes of madness"" at the very end of the film were so great that Martin Scorcese put them into ""Taxi Driver"" and George Lucas put them into ""Star Wars.""

""Psycho"" scared millions in 1960. It made history, and it really doesn't matter if it scares you the same way today. But try watching it alone one night, after midnight, with the sound turned up high to catch Herrmann's music. It's still pretty scary if you let it be.",10

10 March 2013,We all go a little MAD SOMETIMES,"I had this at nine out of ten for the longest time but after a few re- watches and becoming the Hitchcock fan I now am, I must give it a ten.

I wont give anything away in this review but it is groundbreaking in so many ways, this film.

It has horror, suspense (like most Hitchcock films), drama, mystery, just about everything you need. The surprises are amazing, some of the most memorable scenes in Cinema take place here.

The score if fantastic and compelling.

The performances are top notch, it is very original and groundbreaking for its time. Shocking at the end and shocking in the middle.

This is a true nail biter in every sense that term means. I could see why it is ranked so high. One of the best ever for a lot of reasons.

Psycho is a pure 10. Not sure if I have given many movies ten, this deserves it.

See it now! Do not waste time with the re-make the original is boss.",10
2 June 2020,Horror is the best movie genre.,"Yeah i loved this movie.. Story was simple which doesn't mean that it was bad, because it was really good. But i don't want to spoil anything to anyone so watch the movie yourself! Music was too scary, even scarier then the actual movie. Haha i'm just kidding. Acting was good and everything was so perfect! I really don't have any complains.. I seriously don't! Perfect movie, watch it. Even if you don't like horror. Okay bye

9 April 2022,My favorite,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
1 June 2020,Must watch,"80 years on and it still holds up as one of the best. Perkins performance as Norman Bates is fenominal, the story flows beautifully and the directing is majestic. Some of the most iconic lines and images in cinema are drawn from this film and you can tell why.

Watch it!

4 April 2011,Movie review,"One of the most influential and innovative horror films ever made!! Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho shows us all just how great of a filmmaker he really was. Strictly one of his best. This movie goes beyond conventional styles of horror films and brings us into the mind of Hitchcock himself. The movie has an exceptional storyline. The movie also does something exceptional that most horror films seem to always lack, CHARACTER RELATIONSHIP! The movie conveys an excellent stylistic form of really working on the characters. Working on them in such a way that we as the audience can actually grow attached to them. So if something happens to a character in Psycho we as the audience actually feel emotion towards these characters and can really relate to it all. This sense of attachment to the characters and our relationships to them is what draws us that much closer to the movie. That's why Psycho is so scary! Most horror movies show us characters in which we don't know so when something scary and bad happens to them, we could care less. In fact we usually just say ""wow, that guy was so stupid for going off alone."" We don't say that in Psycho. This movie actually scares us, we don't feel that the characters are dumb at all. I really found this style so fascinating. Also this movie had one of the most classic horror shower scenes of all time! One other thing I noted when watching this movie was how well Hitchcock developed the core of the entire story. The movie had an excellent core meaning to it and also showed development, progression and movement. Excellent movie. Hitchcock is a legend and so is this movie.",10
18 December 2012,Best Horror Movie of All Time,"I don't have much to say about Psycho because it's already so well known, and I'll probably ruin it for those who haven't seen it; so I'll keep this brief. Psycho is probably the greatest horror movie of all time. It broke new grounds in film violence with its famous shower scene, and launched the slasher genre. No more atomic age, bring on the psychopaths. Now, this movie isn't like The Exorcist or The Shining, where you'll have nightmares over it; but unlike those movies, this movie keeps you on edge constantly. The whole time, there's just this nervous energy, and you never know what to expect. Hitchcock always believed that there's no terror in the bang, just in the anticipation of it. There are these long scenes that just have you biting your nails the whole time. By the end of the movie, you'll be wondering what happened to your fingers. The movie doesn't rely on cheap horror movie gimmicks. It's not gory, it doesn't use jump scares; the horror lies in the dialogue, the performances, the cinematography, the lighting, the music, and the story. This isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but I still believe it's the greatest horror movie of all time. Why? Because it's the classiest the genre has to offer. Today, the horror genre is so dumbed down, and so unoriginal, that it's nice to look back and see that the horror genre can be done well, and respected for something other than blood and nudity. Psycho is one of the greatest, most suspenseful, most controversial films of all time, and I love it. Hitchcock really knows how to bring on the scares.",10
13 July 2010,still great,"I've just watched this again and it still stands up as a truly great piece of cinema. Anthony Perkins is superb as the nervous twitchy Norman Bates. The conversation between him and Janet Leigh is incredibly tense as the dark under currents in Norman's psyche show through. The shower scene is still shocking and Anthony Perkin's reaction when he sees what his ""mother"" has done is great acting. The style of the film is fascinating as well. It has elements of Film Noir but with a 60s art house feel. It was a brave film for Hitchcock to make at that stage in his career and demonstrates what a true master he was of his craft.

4 December 2015,Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock is a must see,"Being often nicknamed, ""The Master of Suspense"", Alfred Hitchcock certainly does not disappoint in his black and white film, Psycho (1960), with his certain use of psychological examination of his characters that will have you intrigued from the very beginning of his film. Psycho is a classic horror film that challenges the genre for a contemporary audience, a rush of chaotic fear and madness as suspenseful as you would have predicted from the movie that started the slasher genre itself.

Despite a slower pace and dated special effects, it's a well crafted if unconventional horror film. Along with it's creativity, it has a more engaging plot filled with more visual disturbing than almost any other film in the horror genre.

Hitchcock does this by building a connection to his audience to the characters. By getting into the main character, Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind at an early start of the film, has you not only engaged but intensively worried already of what will happen to her. Being a secretary in Phoenix, Marion's conscience drives her insane when she decides to steal 40,000 dollars from a client in order to run away with her love, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With an eerie feel, you are sucked into the movie trying to figure out how and why things are happening to her. The buildup adds to the intensity of the unknown of who is the killer and why their motives are the way that they are.

As Marion Crane tries to run farther away from her problems, not only has she found herself in a huge rainstorm but also exhausted from the endless thoughts of her conscience mind. Having to pull over she is luckily able to find the flickering lights of the Bates Motel to stay the night. There she meets the polite, man of few words, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman welcomes Marion to her stay by casual talk over sandwiches and milk. Norman then explains his interest in taxidermy and his unique relationship with his mother. Hitchcock sets the scene of this encounter by his ability of using foreshadowing with little details of Norman's parlor where the scene takes place. It is there where we find out more about his overbearing, domineering mother. Throughout the entire film, viewers have a sense of suspense always being displayed whether it is through the mysterious music, the director's use of certain angles, or even just the unknown of what we as the audience understand. Hitchcock finds a way of having you always questioning and in a way, overwhelmed with emotions while watching his films. Viewers that are from my generation could say that to be even considered a ""horror"" film or even a ""thriller"" there must be a certain amount of violence or gore to reach this criteria.

However, in 1960, horrified viewers saw Psycho as such a thrilling film and to be surprisingly not explicitly violent which our generation today would be uncommonly found in the latest horror, thriller films. Hitchcock doesn't use the violent gestures to make his film what it is. It is about the psychological intellect that he so deliberately has the audience feel. It is about the buildup and the mysterious overall mood of his masterpiece that has you leaving wanting more.

If the definition of a good thriller to you is gore and violence, Psycho wouldn't necessarily be the movie for you. Not meaning to say that there isn't a scene or two that will take you by surprise, but there is so much more than the gruesome feel to this movie. It is Hitchcock's way of giving his audience enough suspense, curiosity, and most of all, that thrilling feel that makes the must see Psycho what it is, a worldwide phenomenon.",9

9 March 2006,Creepy classic slasher film,"PSYCHO (1960)

directed by: Alfred Hitchcock

starring: Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and John Gavin

plot: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) runs away from home after stealing $40,000 from her employer so she can marry her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin). One rainy night, she takes refuge in the Bates Motel, run by the kind, young Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who also takes care of his ill mother. This sets off a series of horrific events when Marion, Sam, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and a detective (Martin Balsam) try to discover the secrets of the Bates family.

my thoughts: There is really nothing new to say about PSYCHO that hasn't been said already. It's just the perfect thriller. It has a great script, beautiful directing, well developed characters, and much more.

The characters are greatly casted. Anthony Perkins definitely portrayed one of the horror genre's best characters in Norman Bates - a kind, handsome young man who has a lot of dark secrets to hide. Janet Leigh is a very classy actress and it works in the role of a woman who has done some pretty bad things but she is still sympathetic enough to care about. Vera Miles, Martin Balsam, and Simon Oakland also do great while John Gavin is a bit wooden. Not as bad as people say but still wooden.

The setting is also great. A simple, deserted motel with a large, dark, and creepy mansion just over the hill from it. The Bates Motel is a lot like the character of Norman himself. Seems simple and looks nice, but has terrible secrets behind it. The motel and mansion are just like characters in the film.

The music is very suspenseful. I don't think any horror score can match this other than CARRIE. The sound effects that come with the knife make the death scenes much more effective, as the same sound did 16 years later when Carrie used her powers.

Alfred Hitchcock is a great director. The shower scene, the staircase scene, and the finale in the cellar alone are reasons to see this film. I envy anyone who hasn't seen it.

Definitely check it out, it belongs in any movie fan's collection.",10

Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8

25 July 2004,Brilliant !!,"This movie can be simply described with one word : brilliant. It really is brilliant. Every element of this film is brilliant. The plot, the characters, the suspense, the atmosphere, and especially - the ending. It's a masterpiece, 'nuff said. 'Psycho' is without a shadow of a doubt the most scary and creepy movie i have ever seen. And it's not because of the gore, blood and guts. No way, you won't find that in this movie. The suspense and the incredible atmosphere is all this movie needs to be scary. Once again Alfred Hitchcock proved that he is indeed a genius. He wanted the movie to mess with your mind, and he succeeded. All i can say is this : people who didn't see this movie, do it ASAP, don't bother watching the re-make, just watch the original 'Psycho', allow it to enter your minds and play with them a little bit.

6 October 2005,Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Classic Horror,"Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is arguably one of the most classic horror movies ever made. A great deal of iconography associated with the horror genre these days, for example eerie orchestral soundtracks and use of shadows and simplicity, appear to have originated in this movie.

The narrative follows Marion, a young female secretary, who steals a large sum of money from her employer and runs away with the intent of building a new life with her lover. On her journey to her boyfriend's place of work, however, she decides against this action but as it is too dark to either go home or continue the journey she stops to spend the night at a motel. Namely the 'Bates Motel'...

Many of the scenes that follow have become infamous in the world of cinema. When Marion is being shown to be stabbed in the shower very little is seen of the murderer and there is very little noticeable blood. Hitchcock clearly knew the way in which to create real horror is through what is NOT seen. Audiences' imaginations tend to scare them the most.

The film continues to scare the audiences until the very last scene, which is unusual for a horror film. In typical, mediocre, horror films a new equilibrium is usually created and the horror dead or over. But although the film does typically end on a note of normality (albeit with characters having been murdered) Norman Bates is still alive and as creepy as ever, if not more than to begin with. The film works on a number of levels. It fulfils many different categories of horror, in the sense that it displays blood and murder, but also has psychological disturbances and thriller tendencies. It has continued to scare from the sixties to the present day and i am sure it will carry on scaring future generations to come.

I am currently making a Horror Film Trailer for A Level Coursework and will try to feature many ideas from this film in my project! A classic horror film that could only be made by someone of Hitchcock's genius.",10
13 December 2010,Psycho,"Psycho in my opinion is an American classic. It is a heart-pounding movie with good acting and plots twists. Although I felt that the ending was fairly predictable the beginning of the movie definitely had me thinking. I also think that people watching the film back in the sixties appreciate the plot twist and the simpleness of this film. Watching this movie in 2010 the film seems almost jaded but that is because it was one of the better psychological thriller of its time. So the little cliché moments in the movie were at that time probably very scary. For example the shower scene I felt it to be very fake but once again today we see movies such as Saw it is hard to leave anything to the imagination after that. Psycho was a movie that I enjoyed to watch because it had a certain eerie feel throughout the film, and it is one of the only older horror films that have given me chills.

30 June 2007,Horror at it's best,"This is probably one of the greatest horror movies of all time. And even when seeing it in 2007 it still holds up. This is best seen with all the lights out and a lot of popcorn. I did not see this the first time on the big screen but at home..I was too young but and it still scared me. If you haven't seen it enjoy it will bring goose bumps all over your body. The film does wonders on letting your mind projected the horror. All future movies on psycho paths were made following the guidelines of this film. The remake was lame.. I recommend this to anyone interested in viewing horror films without the blood and gore that now is shown. Enjoy.

17 April 2020,you should watch this movie,"In my cinema class, our weekly unit was on Hitchcock films. So, I chose to watch ""Psycho."" Hitchcock is known for his horror films, and this is by far my favorite Hitchcock horror. I think this film has quality cinematography. The sound effects used, really added to the spooky vibe this film gives off. This film has many camera angels, short shots, and clean transitions. The editing and directing was outstanding. Throughout this film I felt like I was on the edge of my seat and had an eerie feeling. ""Psycho"" makes me think twice before staying at a motel. This film uses psychological and physical aspects to make this film original and thrilling. I really enjoy the plot line, and I think the characters really made this film feel realistic. Also, I really enjoy the television show ""Bates Motel"" that was inspired by this film. I would recommend this film to people who love horror films. It is really good, and entertaining.

22 July 2008,Wonderful Movie,"Vertigo is defitely Hitchcock's masterpiece from a director's standpoint. It had new and innovative cinematography techniques and a very complex plot line. It was no doubt one of a kind and is still unrivaled by any other thriller because it is impossible to copy it. Psycho is the exact opposite. Psycho was the first true slasher film, but even more, it was the first thriller/horror blockbuster. Sure their had been others before it, The cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Frankenstein for example, but none of them hit home the same way that Psycho did. Psycho is a triumph for the common movie watcher. It is a movie that any one can enjoy because it is deceptively simple. Even more than that, however, it is probably one of, if not the, most influential films ever. Many films have tried, unsuccessfully of course, to imitate its one of a kind plot and execution. Any slasher film about a family going to a secluded place and being stalked by an invisible killer can be traced back to psycho. But even with the endless copies and even one remake, no movie has ever captured the horror of Psycho. The Exorcist was a text book grossout film, Jaws was scary for frequent beach goers, and Alien was a horrific movie about our friends from outer space. All three of these don't approach psycho for one reason and one reason alone: The Shower Scene. It is hard to still get the full efect of the shower scene because there is so little blood. It is nothing compared to some of the brutal murders from movies such as Last House on the Left. It, however, taps a nerve that no one else has, and that is not from too little effort. No, it is great for one reason and one reason alone, it is a SHOWER scene. This is the reason it is so scary. I could not take a shower with the curtain closed for a week after I saw this movie. The reason it is so scary is because most people in America take a shower at least once a day. Sure Jaws is scary, but some people go there whole life time without going to beach. Everyone takes showers. It is also hard for the average person to realize just how vulnerable they are in the shower. This is the reason why this scene is so powerful. It uses an event that happens in many households every day. This is what sets psycho apart and this is why it is so unique. So, in conclusion, My advise to any slasher film fans is to watch Psycho, love Psycho, worship Psycho.",10

John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
6 April 2011,Very good suspenseful movie.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue"").

4 June 2019,An Overrated Movie for present generation,"Well the plot is pretty simple and straightforward. There is nothing horror/scary about the movie. Maybe it was a good movie in 1960. But it doesn't live up to its hype for the present generation. The good thing about the movie was its climax. Though Anthony Perkins didn't seem to be scary throughout the movie...only after the revelation about the murders (trying to avoid spoilers) , his face was way too scarier. Even when I think of him , it is really scary.

12 April 2013,A boy's best friend is his mother.,"Directed by Alfred Hitchcock

Starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin.

Written by Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch

'A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and subsequently encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.'

Upon the arrival of the new hit series 'Bates Motel' it has gotten me in a 'Psycho' mood. This was my first Alfred Hitchcock film and I must admit when I watched it, I broke the legendary Director's first and only rule : ""The picture you MUST see from the beginning... Or not at all!""

'Psycho' is one of those films I put with the elite like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Amadeus and The Godfather Series. These films changed my perspective on film in some form or another and when I speak about Psycho, I'm referring to storytelling and camera usage. Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job creating this film. Everything works! The story, the acting, the cinematography and the music! Hitchcock's efforts with the camera reminded me of 'Taxi Driver.' Often, the camera stole so much away from the actors' efforts when creating emotion on screen. There were positions and movements I've never seen before. The classic 'Shower Scene' reminded me a lot of Scorsese due to the fact of the quick cuts throughout and I'm not surprised Scorsese would take a few notes from Hitch.

The acting in this picture is something people never really emphasize and it is deservingly so. Not taking anything away from the actors/actresses but it was how 'Psycho' was shot that people will remember forever. But the cast was great! I will point out that I really enjoyed Anthony Perkins' fantastic performance as the legendary Norman Bates. When you see Perkins on screen, it's as if he has an extra layer around him that you want to rip off to reveal something you shouldn't know. You can see he's hiding something of some sort and you want to just shake it out of him. He keeps you on your toes throughout the film and you won't be able to blink without missing a detail.

Out of all the aspects I pointed out about 'Psycho', the music comes out as the triumphant winner. It's suspense at its finest! As Janet Leigh's character tries to escape with the $40,000, the music itself tells you everything you need to know about the emotions running through her body. The quick beats and violins' running imitating a heartbeat gives you goose bumps. But nothing is more terrifying than the screeching violins playing throughout the 'mother' scenes. A nice test everybody can attempt is to play the scenes without the music, you will see the impact the sounds has on the film. As every screech is heard, you flinch back and back with discomfort and want it to stop. Truth be told, Hitchcock originally wanted those scenes silent and we can all agree he would've made a huge mistake! It's absolute magic!

Psycho is a film that everybody should experience not only for entertainment purposes but as a history lesson in terrific filmmaking. It's difficult attempting to review this film without giving away anything but if you haven't seen 'Psycho', don't make the same mistake I did. Watch it from the beginning and don't stop",9
14 December 2018,We all go a little mad sometimes.,"Psycho is an interesting watch for sure with some great camera work and fantastic acting by Anthony Perkins he really steals the show and brings the character of Norman Bates to life it's a treat just to watch how perfect he does so. The story is pretty linear and follows the grim events that take place at bates motel, it's hard to say much without spoiling the plot but if you're a fan of psychological horror I'm sure you'd enjoy it. The film is also filled with all sorts of neat motifs and symbolism that are fun to discover within the first or second viewing. This film will surely linger in your brain long after watching it. My appreciation for it just kept evolving and made me want to watch the following sequels as well as the bates motel TV series (a fantastic series!) a very interesting character and world are created within this film and it got me obsessed!

29 March 2010,loved it,"The 1960 hit psycho is truly a classic. I must have first view it when I was 10. When I saw it when I was young it creepy me right out. Now viewing again I wasn't crept out as much but I really got to appreciate the way in which the film is done. I'm a fan of a few of Alfred Hitchcock films. The lighting is amazing. Very light and crystal clear. The film has a straight forward plot structure. The film draws you in. It keeps you interested. First you are following the plot of a lady who has stolen money and on the run. Then she gets killed and you completely forget about her, now you are forces on this creepy hotel and weird owner. The first murder scene is done so well. The woman is in the shower she doesn't notice but the audiences can her, Norman's mother's shadow. You don't see the mothers face but you see her stab. You never see the knife actual stab the girl. This scene I felt was tastefully done. You know that girls gets stab by Normans mother not by seeing her pierce the skin but by the motion of the knife that is shown and the girls lifeless body in a pool of blood. I love how the camera tied the nest scene in by going to the shower drain. Then moves out slowly from her eye, then to the unknown hidden money to a shocked Norman cleaning up his mother's murder. Though the movie you develop pity for poor Norman. He is a kind genuine man. You think he would never hurt a fly. His seems nice and charming a little bit on the weird side. He stuff birds but makes it weird is how much he enjoys it. You feel bad for him because it seems he is trapped by his mother. That she has turned him into a mama's boy. At the end you're in for a crazy twist. Though out the movie the suspense builds up, you can wait to see this bitch. But then you are surprise when you see the mother and who she really is. I never would have guess. I thought that the film was brilliantly done. How the mothers face in never relived till the end. Or why you could only her mother when she is having a conversation with her son when you don't see them. But in the end you understand why and how the film got its name. The end makes so much sense when you re watch the film knowing the ending. At",
10 May 2010,Psycho,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
27 August 2001,"Great, but the remakes even better.","Like I said, see the remake first. Hitchcock said that the reason he made Psycho in B/W was because it would have been too scary in colour. Although the acting of Perkins is slightly better than Vaughn, the remake is a scarier and therefore more effective film for todays audience.

28 April 2010,Hitchcock at his best,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away.

15 April 2015,review of psycho,"Psycho is truly a great example of the ending of 'classic Hollywood.' Director, Alfred Hitchcock is now a household name. This horror film was the begging for a new generation of movie types and movie goers. In an attempt to not make the movie too graphic the camera angles were mostly looking right at a characters face, relying on their acting to key the viewer into what is going on. The director also doesn't really use too many dim lights in the scenes where the most horrific things take place. This is an odd difference to the typical horror film we are used to seeing. However i do not feel that this in anyway took away the overall feel of the movie, and the horror scenes within.

4 May 2016,Psycho,"Excellent film, a real classic. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. The score is iconic and the film wouldn't be the same without it. Anthony Perkins's performance was brilliant and complex. I already had a vague understanding of his character prior to viewing the film, but I was shocked once Norman Bates' many layers were revealed to the camera. There was never a dull moment in this movie, and almost every part of the plot came as a surprise. Hitchcock is a terrific director and the suspense in Psycho never faltered. The lighting and editing augmented the cloak and dagger mood of the film. There was an excellent use of shadow to show everything that was happening without compromising the plot. Nothing in the movie quite happened as expected, making it the perfect thriller.

14 November 2020,Underwhelming but entertaining,"As the title implies, this movie was very underwhelming, and was told to be a horrifying movie, when in reality I found no scariness in the movie, and was overall unphased by the attempted horror aspect, but on an opposite hand I belive that the sound in the film, specifically the music, well phenomenal and gave the film so much more suspense and it could not have fit better.

8 November 2011,Classic Thriller,"""Psycho"" is perhaps the best horror film of all time, directed by the best horror director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock. It has a simple plot, and to describe the events that take place would be quick work, but the suspense and fear the film creates can not be described. Hitchcock was masterful. His direction of this film made something as pedestrian as a police officer approaching a car, or taking a hot shower fill you with a sense of fear and trepidation. Hitchcock let the suspense build throughout the film, while the plot twisted and turned until the shocking climax, that I'm sure no one saw coming. Anthony Perkins was wonderful as the quiet Norman Bates, and the rest of the cast was solid. This film was Hitchcock's magnum opus, that embodied movie making at its finest. From camera work, to acting, to plot, Hitchcock made a film that defines what quality is, while tantalizing and scaring you more than you would think possible.

2 December 2009,psycho review,"Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, hands down. This is probably one of Alfred Hitchcocks more famous and better work in his career. Even though he is an odd person, he has the mind of an odd mysterious suspenseful genius. Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. For too long the famous shower scene with the girl getting murdered is still a favorite scene to remember from people when they talk about Psycho. Also, The Bates Motel is a famous landmark name in the movie. The storyline is well done, the acting is almost to perfection, and the cinematography is acceptable in every way.

When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
7 December 2010,Review of Psycho,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

7 May 2011,Afraid to Shower,"I have seen ""Psycho"" many times, and each time I am terrified by both the shower scene and the stairs seen. ""Psycho"" tells the story of Marion Crane staying at the Bate's Motel and her Motel owner. Strange things start to happen and the audience as well as Marion become horrified as to what is going on. Hitchcock's genius comes from the sound effects and music , I discovered. Camera angles bring fear to the audience as well. The scene where Hitchcock delivers an ariel shot of Norman Bates coming out of the bedroom with the infamous ""Psycho"" soundtrack playing is extremely frighting because of the suddenness with witch it happened. What I had noticed in multiple viewings is that the movie is hardly as scary without the sound, hence Hitchcock's masterful use os sound effects and camera.

9 November 2011,Hitchcock presents THE horror film,"as an avid horror fan getting to go back and watch Psycho not just because i felt like it but with the intent to examine it was an interesting proposition and one that gave me a greater appreciation for the film. Alfred Hitchcock has assembled some of the greatest psychological thrillers and cerebral horror films ever made... Psycho is no exception. superbly acted especially by the timelessly unnerving Anthony Perkins... this movie features great camera work and cinematography... the use of shadow and obscured vision really sells some of the tensest moments Hitchcocks semi surreal sensibilities add the mysterious air that keeps the viewer in a vice and squeezes till the buildup is too much to bear... the exposition takes a little while to get through but once its rolling there is no stopping it.... the score in this film is not only suer effective it is among the most recognizable pieces of music in history. the copy i saw was i think one of the cleaned up anniversary editions so the picture and sound were stellar... there isn't much i can say that hasn't been said to death about psycho

6 November 2011,"""...With my trusty umbrella.""","""Psycho"" is one of the most brilliantly-executed thrillers that I've ever seen. After seeing such films as ""Rebecca"" and ""Sabotage,"" I can see how different this films appear and feel from other Hitchcock films. It's easy to be swept into its terrific atmosphere and characters, and you never expect what happens next in the plot. The score for the film is also spectacular; I could listen to the opening credits track all day. The infamous shower scene was a well-constructed part of the movie. I like how it was shot, the position of the characters in the shot, and the music during the shot. Alfred Hitchcock hit everything right on the nail and produced one of the most shocking scenes in cinema.

2 April 2012,Well Done,"Alfred hitchcock was always known for his great suspenseful movie, Psycho is one of the most popular suspenseful horror movie that hitchcock had made in my opinion because it shocked you without actually showing the penetration of the knife. To my discretion, movie like these made in the 60's never really caught my attention because I wasn't a big fan of them. I enjoy movies where there are two sides to a person because it confuses you and have you thinking its anther person. In all conclusions, when you think its two people it was only____, wouldn't you like to know? Nonetheless this movie was filled with great unexpected scenes and wonderful acting; I applaud the actors in this movie, well done.

6 November 2012,pretty freaking creepy.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
22 July 2012,A Classic that's actually GOOD,"Classics are often underwhelming, because they are often described as the pinnacle of filmaking, whereas in truth, films get better and better.

The presentation is the most obvious- black and white cannot compare with color (but works in this case!). Ranking movies is a bit like ranking ""which firearm is the best?"", because while there may be classics, the newer ones have the benefit of the knowledge of the older ones! Movies look at the old ideas and improve upon them. People might not agree with this, but I think it is nostalgia that is ruining their perception.

THAT said, this movie is actually quite thrilling. I enjoy watching classic movies for the insight in how filmmaking has improved as an art, but usually have low expectations because we all have been spoiled.

Everybody probably knows the plot by now, but if you don't, it's worth a watch. As long as you have a decent attention span, you'll be fine.

26 March 2013,Psycho,"My first time watching this movie was in high school. We were learning how to become a film critic. So in order to become a film critic, we needed to learn about the history of films. Psycho was a film that we needed to know the history of. Not being a fan of scary movies, watching this over and over again never gets old. The fact that this film was such a success to Hitchcock's life makes it a better watch. Also the fact that this is the film that all other films, including horror films, make reference to this very movie. The references stem from the music that plays, the scenes that were made, and the shots that were created. This film is the godfather of all horror films, to say the least. The history behind this film makes it a phenomenal film. Seeing the new released film Hitchcock, about the making of the movie with the leading star Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, has the original Psycho make so much more sense to those who haven't had the opportunity to study the history of this film. Both movies, recommended see.

18 July 2004,Just see it. I hope you will not be disappointed.,"This movie is by far the best Hitchcock film, in a world where there are so many to choose from. There is something about this movie that stands out above all the rest. Yes, it is missing the vibrant color of Vertigo, and claustrophobic feel of Rear Window. That does not matter. Although i am a huge fan of Mr. Hitchcock ( he really is the master ), this film just stands out to me. First off it did introduce me to his work, so right there it holds a bit of a tug at my heart. I founded his other great films because of watching this film.

The story takes you somewhere and leaves you, and then takes you somewhere else....you have to see it ,to understand what i mean. I do not mean at all that it takes you somewhere and leaves you in a bad way, at all. Just the opposite. It's all for the good. It was and still is a shocking tale, based loosely on true events from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. Which is disturbing enough to know that it could have been real, but oh well.

Just see it. I hope you will not be disappointed",
9 April 2014,Analysis for Psycho (1960),"I like the way Alfred Hitchcock made this film. This was another classic horror film that people should remember. This has a lot of scenes that I remember, like the infamous shower scene. This is considered the most famous horror scene ever made. I even felt a little scared when I saw it. There are some more good parts about this film, like it had some good camera shots, it was scary and horrifying, and it had a lot of good acting in it. The shower scene sums up the film and the genre perfectly. The only flaw that I found in this one was the setup that it used. It was in black-and-white, but that's one thing about this film that makes it stand out like some of the others. Overall, this happens to be one of the greatest yet most frightening horror movie that I've ever seen.

4 May 2014,classic,"i was kind of skeptical about psycho when i first watched it. it started out kind of slow. but it picked up and got very interesting. im a huge fan of bates motel and just now seeing this was made it a little more interesting to me, to see the comparisons between norman bates from this movie and from the television show. i think the editing is really well done here. there's a great use of cutting between the main character in a car and of her Point of view from in the car. its very strong. the lighting fits great with the movie as well. same with the music. some of the music gives you the feeling as if you can feel what character would be. the flow of the story is really good and consistent as well

10 December 2018,Art History,"Story: The story is captivating. A great thriller about a young man who suffers from mental disorders. It has its lengths, especially in the beginning, but when it comes to the motel part, things are starting to evolve and the pace picks up. 7/10

Actors: They all do an amazing job, but the one who carries to whole movie is Anthony Perkins - his acting skills are phenomenal. The fact that it was released in 1960 makes this even more outstanding. 9/10

Setting: Even after watching Psycho so many times, the house and motel scenery still gives me the goosebumps. 10/10

Picture: Not bad for its age, but have seen some better restorement. 5/10

Sound: The sound quality was disasterous. Voices were extremely quiet, as if the actors were mumbling, while the music was way too loud and shrill. 2/10

Score: Just one word, amazing! 10/10

Average: 7,1/10 The movie is an outstanding piece of art history. Compared to today's standard, it has lost a bit of its shine. Nonetheless, if you haven't watched it yet, do it, you won't regret it.

Watched on: Netflix Language: English",7
27 April 2015,Psycho - My Review,"I've seen this long before the film classes I took. I remember watching it for the first time and really liking it, and it struck me as a different film I could thoroughly enjoy simply for its content and camera work. Of course it had the famous shower scene, but how everything was put together was just so, so pretty. Its black and white film is stunning and crisp, and even the opening credits were interesting to watch.

I'm not really sure why certain characters did what they did since it sometimes made them seem out of character, but I guess for the sake of its environment and sequence of events it made sense for what it was. The lighting was great too, especially when the main lead talks with Norman with his taxidermy in the hotel rooms. It looks so eerie yet it draws you in and you want to know more about it when you see it. That and I could see how this movie could be so inspirational for future filmmakers, especially with shows based off of this film like Bates Motel (which I need to watch), simply because Norman's relationship with his mother was mysterious and vague, yet the film showed just enough for you to get the best impression without too much of an explanation. Then again, would anyone really want to know? Considering what happened? All in all, a pretty good watch and something I would recommend to anybody looking for something interesting to watch.",8
13 May 2015,Psycho Review,"Never seeing this film or any other work of Alfred Hitchcock, I was intrigued to see what many people loved about him. There is just something different about him, but in a good way. First of all, Psycho was released in 1960 in black and white. At this point in film history, almost every single movie that was released was in color and watching this film definitely gave it the feeling of a film released in the 1930s-40s. The shower murder scene is one of the most famous scenes in film history and is definitely worth noting. Never seeing the scene in its entirety, I wasn't sure what to expect. Originally I was a little bit disappointed in the realism of the scene but after further analysis, I realized that Hitchcock might have done this on purpose just to fit his mold of uniqueness. Overall, I was a fan of the film as the suspense seemed to build tremendously behind a very creepy character of Norman Bates. I'm not sure if I would call myself a huge Alfred Hitchcock fan but his work is certainly unique.

7 May 2016,"Aw, what a sweet....psychopath?!","This film by Alfred Hitchcock does a very good job of hiding the twist ending that comes. My summary line doesn't even begin to tell of what one can expect to see when viewing this film. Through use of close-ups, Hitchcock shows us the facial expression of how a particular character feels by minor changes in their face, even more so their eyes. He enjoys the use of reverse shots, but in his case, I feel they up the sense of suspense through primarily upping the tension one feels during this movie after the famous shower scene. Because if that happened within the first 20 minutes of the film, when will the next, over an hour, time left of this film?! So Hitchcock already has us invested and a bit uneasily inquisitive, to where we're itching to want to low what happens next. The magnetic film is also accentuated by the use of voice-overs not by the on- screen person. The 2 main ones are during the time Marion Crane rushed away into the night after she's committed her crime; the second was at the end, when inner voices, voices that may or may not be one's own, come out to play and act very ""tell tale heart"" with how easily the latter contributes. This film will shock, captivate, and engaging discussion, and a lack of realism that is beneficial to the telling of the film. If one has not seen it, buyer beware, the shower scene will forever be scorched into your memory.",9
4 April 2006,"The less you know, the more you'll enjoy","If you are preparing to watch this film, and, If you are fortunate enough to have never seen the film, or only read a little about it, be prepared for a classic 60's film. It made number 23 in the ratings, but I rated it much higher, probably top 10.

Enjoy everything that this genre is about. Suspense, horror, fear, etc.etc. This is obviously a film of the 60's, but I reckon that, as a classic it stands the test of time. For me, the best scene isn't the famous shower scene, It is the scene where Arbogast sweats some answers out of Norman. The less you know about this film, the more you will enjoy it, so I've kept this comment to a minimum.

16 December 2010,amazing film,"pure suspense and unease. This film relies on all sorts of tricks and moods to get you wrapped up in the events that unfold. Certain camera angles leave lots of space within the frame, you keep thinking, somethings going to pop out at any minute. Sometimes the camera gets really close and it feels awkward and disconcerting. There are so many uncomfortable moments in this film. It toys with you. It didn't shy away from taboo subjects. You honestly don't know where it will go until you get there. Anthony Perkins is amazing in this, he's both very human and likable but uncomfortably awkward at the same time. The music really sets the mood, it never lets up in its intensity. This is the perfect thriller because it knows that the best thing to show is almost nothing. Imply everything. Leave it up to the imagination, it'll be much worse that way.

After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
29 March 2010,Really Good Horror Movie !,"It was very surprising when the women was murdered because I thought she was the main actress. In addition, I looked at the bar that shows the time of the movie; it was just in the middle of the movie, this encouraged my curiosity to know what was going on and what would happen to the money. The scene of murdering is really classic, especially when the camera zoom out of her eye slowly. Besides, taking a shower is the time to feel relax, is not any idea or attention in the mind. Therefore, when the murder show up, it break down unconscious and makes the audience feel frightened. Nevertheless, it is weird because we could not see the knife touch her body. Moreover, the scene that after she bought the new car, we would hear the voice of the conversation while she was driving. These voices told the other parts of the story that help the audience more understand. Furthermore, the setting is really good, especially the house with the perfect quantity of the light is very horrible. Plus, there are a lot background musics that make the movie more scary and excited. In the scene that the detective walked up the stair we would the the changing the angle of the camera to be high angle. I think it is very appropriate for this scene that is unpredictable because we could not see what he see.",9
10 November 2010,weird doesn't even begin to explain this from the mother to the son,"I absolutely loved the areal view shot of the city in the beginning of the movie. I thought this movie did a great job of being a thriller i felt very anxious the whole time I was watching it. Everyone was very odd, or weird. They all acted strange and antsy. The music helped tremendously with establishing the feel of the mis-en-scene of the movie. As did the vacant hotel, the sketchy police man and the dreary weather. The fast cuts between Marion and the police officer while he was following her added to the ""freaky/ weird"" feel of the movie as did all the birds in the mans office at the motel and the yells that came from the house. If I were Marion as soon as I found out that I was the only one stating there i would have left as fast as I could especially seeing how inquisitive the man was. After seeing the shower scene that was shown as an example in the Hitchcock interview I realized just how complex it really was. I think that scene and the areal view scene were my favorite.

9 November 2011,Amazing.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree.

19 December 2012,Psycho,"I think all that can be said about this film, like some classics has already been said. Janet Leigh screaming in the shower is the seminal horror film image of all time. The movie has some of the best plot twists toward the middle I've ever seen, the control of climax and character study, their psychology and manners is impressive. There's a pleasurable amount of photographic technique and detail, of precision throughout the film and that makes it lasting. There's very little gore or violence which is great, because it leaves that up to the imagination unlike other films. Some of the actors come across brilliantly in their creepiness and darkness, and their motives aren't always exactly known, the thrill is skillfully and cleverly composed and arranged and released throughout the film, it lives up to its name.

10 April 2013,Psycho,"Everything about this movie is excellent. The genre of horror/thriller movies are always fun to watch, either alone if you're daring, or with a group of people to make it more fun. Hitchcock is a truly talented director, with many good movies, but this one is definitely up there on his list of great movies directed by him. The plot of ""Psycho"" is extremely engaging. It has a viewer on the edge of their seat during the entire movie. This movie also has some major plot twists that cause the viewer to question what in fact they are actually watching, but since it is a Hitchcock film, that should be expected. All in all though, this movie was great because it had a plot that kept an audience invested in the film, and the acting w as good too.

Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
9 May 2014,Pushing the envelope,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects.

13 May 2016,psycho,"This movie really influenced horror movies today so its a great film and easy to appreciate. The use of loud and sharp music adds to the fear. The shower scene is a great example of a lot of things the music that starts to play to imply something sinister is about to happen. The Hand holding the knife and the terrified expressions. All of that is intense. The most brutal part to me though is actually after the killing because the girl is just dead on the shower floor and all wee see is her face and the entire time the shower Is still running that right there is chilling. The shower still going is so genuine the fact that the clip doesn't end right after the act just makes the murder feel real like shes dead and there is nothing left but the water. This film is filled with groundbreaking shots. That being said I find Hitchcock to be a little corny in instances. Like sometimes someone will walk back too far and fall off something to their death and that just seems dumb to me but all in all this was a good movie.

18 July 2004,Alfred Hitchcock at his very best,"How can anyone not have an appreciation for this movie. It was this movie and it's director that changed the way modern films are made. This film raised the bar for a horror film, because it hit close to home and seemed not like some faraway fantasy but something real. The characters seemed to mirror real life, and it made you afraid to take a shower, afraid to turn of the light in your bedroom. This movie still inspires fear in this day and age of blood and gore, because it is a psychological horror film that play with the mind and not your digestive system. This movie represents the worst fears of many people, because it is a story that still shocks you even when you've watched it several times.

10 April 2021,Psycho,"Psycho is one of Hitchcock's famous films. One characteristic Hitchcock uses is the screeching violin sequence in the most intense scenes of the movie. This music technique is used throughout psycho, it is seen when Marion is taking a shower in the motel bathroom and when Arbogast is stabbed. The camera angles Hitchcock used were new and innovative. For example, the shower scene with Marion he uses a close up camera angle to capture Marion's facial expressions, emotions, and to build tension. By using this shot the audience can get a glimpse into the horror that the character is feeling. The sounds and camera angles used by Hitchcock add another element of suspense to his films.

12 November 2001,A Prey To Norman Bates,"Janet Leigh, who played Marion Crane, stole money, from her employer George Lowery. She left town, with the stolen money, changed cars, then went onward, to the Bates Motel. I believe she had a guilty conscience and she was going to go back and confess to her crime. Little did she know, that she would be dead before morning. After being stabbed in the shower, her body was plunged into the moat. She should have been honest.

16 December 2010,Classic!,"Psycho, so much to be said about it but it can't possibly be described in words. An amazing American film that revolves around Marion Crane who isn't happy with her life at that current moment in time. The time she can spend with her boyfriend Sam is restricted by her working and his situation of having to pay alimony. One day her employer trusts her with $40,000 in cash, at this point in time she sees the perfect opportunity to take the money and run to meet Sam in California when, during a terrible storm, she has to pull over to stay the night at the Bates Motel. Peculiar things go on at the motel run by a man named Norman who seems to share an odd relationship with his mother.

A really great film with amazing camera effects - the shower scene is infamous for many reasons one of which is how many camera takes are really in it. The photography of the film is outstanding and it shall remain a classic to be admired for it's production quality and the writing of the story itself.",10

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

8 May 2013,Psycho,"One of the most classic horror films in history. It is a Hitchcock film in which a beautiful women finds what she thinks is a very nice proper man but is wrong. He was abused and dominated by his mother as a child which lead him to become the Psycho.Hitchcock plays the code very well and uses different shots and angles to show the horror of his film instead of directly showing the killings. A scene that is almost always mentioned when talking about horror films is in this film the epic shower scene. Which has seemed to be adopted by a lot of horror films after Psycho was made. The story itself is pretty intricate for a horror film and i really enjoyed watching it.

22 April 2013,Not the goriest horror movie you'll ever see,"Overall I found this movie very suspenseful and interesting. The fact that Norman was dealing with a split personality was a very strange way to explain the murders but at the same time I didn't see it coming. One thing that was somewhat pleasing but at the same time somewhat discouraging was the lack of blood and gore that you would typically see in today's horror films. During the scene of the first murder of Marion you could clearly see that she was being stabbed but at the same time you didn't see her cut up body, open wounds, or blood pouring down her body. You could only really see blood being flushed down the drain and even then it wasn't a lot of blood. I also found the cinematography to be good as well because during the murder scenes you could make out a shadow of the killer which made one believe that it was a woman because their hair was tied in a bun and you could clearly see women's clothing however that played an important role in making the murder unsuspecting by the audience and adds to the wow factor or the twist of who the murderer really is. Overall this was a well out together film and yet still suspenseful.

11 May 2013,Wow,"Okay, so I am obsessed with horror films. Even though this film is quite old and the effects are a bit dated. I would definitely have to say that this horror flick is way better than some out in theaters today! The music went well with the scenes. There were a great deal of lighting and contrasting used to create a sort of eerie feel. The plot was outrageous but not too far fetch. What made this film so great is that it is believable. All the incidents that happen in the film are things are not fantasy. The actors played their characters very well. Their words, feelings and emotions they portrayed felt authentic. The editing allowed for discontinuity during murder scenes, where certain images were a bit choppy. Overall , I give this film an A.

18 April 2016,Alfred Hitchhock at his Finest,"This movie really shows why Alfred Hitchcock is known to be the best filmmaker of suspense and thrilling movies. The suspense shown throughout the movie and especially during the famous scene when Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) was murdered in a shower, this scene exemplified the suspense that was present throughout the entire movie. The highlight of the film is the acting done by Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He really becomes the character from the facial tics. Many people prefer the original movie from 1960 than the remake from 1998 and I think this has a lot to do with Anthony Perkins. Overall this is in my top 10 horror movies.

5 November 2020,Movie Review: Psycho,"Psycho is probably the most iconic Alfred Hitchcock as well as the one of the most iconic movies ever made. Psycho is about Marion Crane after she steals 40,000 dollars from her employer and plans to run away with her boyfriend. However, after driving through the back roads on a stormy night, she decides to stop at the Bates Motel where she meets the proprietor of the motel Norman Bates. This movie is a real horror classic that is still studied in film classes around the United States to this day. I personally like this movie and the creepy atmosphere that it gives off, it makes it feel like Marion is stuck at this motel with someone that she can't exactly trust. I would recommend this movie to anyone that like horror/thriller movies or just wants to see a classic Alfred Hitchcock movie.

5 November 2002,The Best Horror Movie Ever Made,"Nobody was ever as good as Hitchcock. Nobody. And Hitch gets to show off the full scope of his directing talents with Psycho, his 1960 masterpiece of terror, suspense, drama and mystery. Drawing the audience in from the first scene, seriously screwing with their minds, then throwing them back out again, the Master of Suspense more than lives up to his prestigious title.

In a classic bit of directorial finesse, Hitchcock throws the audience for one of the biggest loops in movie history 50 minutes into the movie. Until then, the film has focused on Janet Leigh's character and the money-stealing plot. Who knew she would die so suddenly? From there the movie goes on to focus on the likable yet obviously troubled Norman Bates and his somewhat suspicious relationship with his mysterious mother.

Toying with our emotions like no one else could, Hitch forces us to root for Norman through the rest of the movie, even to a subconcious degree. We know that Norman is covering up a murder, but, admit it, when that car was sinking in the swamp and it stopped, you wanted it to go all the way down just as much as Norman, didn't you? Taken on an intellectual standpoint, this movie can make you question your morals, beliefs, and ethics. Or you can just relax and let it scare the hell out of you. Both ways are equally effective.

Words like ""thrilling,"" and ""disturbing"" are thrown around a lot these days. However, this movie inarguably sets the standard by which ""thrilling"" and ""disturbing"" movies will forever be measured. It's a classic of filmmaking, and you cannot rightfully call yourself a movie buff until you have seen it. Be forewarned though - it may make you swear off showers for a lifetime.

2 December 2009,Classic Goody!,"AMAZING!!!! Hitchcock was such an artist. He had an amazing way of making a character pop out in each in their own way. The viewer could feel the actors emotions through the film. That is not only great acting, that is good directing as well. The picture and directing were wonderful in so many ways. Each frame in the film was so intense and beautifully lit up. The high-key and low key lighting throughout the whole movie was perfect. Hitchcock knew just how to light up a scene then quickly make it dark and dim for just the right element of three key lighting. He made it look easy. An example is the back lighting he would use whenever the film showed the house normal bates (Anthony Perkins) lived in with his mother. The house looked scary and evil. Hitchcock payed attention to every detail in all of his films. For a film directed in 1960 is still gave me the creeps. Going into this movie i had assumed that it was going to be similar to the movie in 1998, but it was totally different. I loved this one much more.

John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",
9 May 2013,A shocking classic,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on.

10 September 2013,The oldest psycho homicide movie,"This is the movie about psycho killer's story. The main characters are one woman who works at office, her boyfriend, sister, one man who managing a motel, and his mother. It will be interesting that you watch it and guess the killer and why the killer kills victim.

I am interested in this movie. It is because when I research this movie, the website said this movie became a forerunner of psycho homicide movie. Then, I saw this movie at the theater (By chance, the movie was shown at one theater). I was so excited about this movie. The scene that policeman and private eye talks about the madder how and who did it is really interesting. I was surprised last scene.

I recommend this movie. It is oldest psycho homicide movie. Psycho homicide movies are popular now days. I like kind of this movie. If you also like kind of this movies, you must try to watch it!

9 May 2014,great Hitchcock film,"This movie is definitely a classic. Hitchcock's work is notable for its infusion of horror and mystery and its great form. The story follows a young woman on the run who had recently embezzled a large sum of money from her occupation. When she finally winds up at the vacant Bates Motel, her journey takes an unexpected turn. The film features excellent photography at times, while at others the camera is used to create a claustrophobic and jarring sense. Hitchcock also makes effective use of diagetic and non diagetic sound, particularly during the climax of the film. This is a must see for horror and mystery fans, or to those interested in different genres of film.

12 September 2018,Psycho is so scary I am afraid of it!,"Great movie! How could this picture not have won an Oscar? And also 'The Birds!' Anytime a picture has you this afraid to go into rooms in the house - OSCAR material! Just like Hitchcock's 'Rebecca' Terrifying! Love All of them!

27 March 2003,"Overrated, underperformed B-movie","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" has gone down in history as one of the most psychologically disturbing thrillers ever made. I strongly disagree. I started this movie fully expecting to be disturbed and scared, but finished it feeling robbed. The problem with this movie is the hype. Had it not been hyped as the scariest film ever made, than it would have gone over better. But as it stands, Psycho DOESN'T stand. Back in 1960, movie-going Americans were not at all expecting this, had never seen anything like this, and were probably very shocked when they did. This movie started the endless number of slasher-type films we know today, such as ""Halloween"", and the Jason series. Of them, I can't say Psycho is any better. Hitchcock does well with the cinematography, but falls short in the suspense area. His predecessors, such as Ridley Scott (Alien), Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath), and many others succeeded where he failed. The acting in Psycho is pretty good, though sometimes mechanical. Bottom-line: If you have NEVER seen a horror film, particularly of the slasher type, than you will find this a chilling film. But for modern, decensitized America, it will only be looked at as a good B-movie.",5

9 August 2017,One of the greatest horror movies,"This movie is the long version of the Japanese television series, ""Tales of the Unusual"". Psycho is a very complicated story, and I also can say that it's too good.

I really haven't understood who the psychopath or a lead character is as the story continues because some characters on it are extraordinary. The strangely real story makes us feel all the more scared although it's supposed to be fiction.

Furthermore, the weird sound of the violin can set off restlessness and fear among us. The sound is actually used by some horror games as far as I know.

Also, you'll be reluctant to take a shower alone for a few days after watching it.

15 April 2021,A Classic Alfred Hitchcock Film,"When it comes to thrillers, this has to be one of the best. The acting is great, story is great, Hitchcock is really a legend when it comes to these kinds of films. The cinematography was good; I thought there were some nice shots like pans, zooming in and zooming out shots, I thought they were done well. Anthony Perkins who played Norman Bates is great; he has great facial acting and he sold the idea that his character was off from the very beginning. The music queues were really good too. During some of the scenes that are meant to be scary or suspenseful, we hear that high pitch violin to really give the full effect of suspension. I give this film an 8 out of 10 because it's such a classic.

When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
11 May 2012,Hitchcock Did It...,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie.

7 November 2012,good movie,"By watching the newer version of this movie first it didn't make seeing the original as good as it would of been if I had seen it first. The movie overall was great it had all the elements of a great thriller you didn't know who the real killer was until you got close to the end of the film. The plot was great the way the story unfolded was another strong point in the movie. The actors played their roles really well especially the killer his character was great because he was just nervous a the time but got defensive in an instant whenever his mother is involved which kept it really entertaining given the fact that you don't see the mother you only hear her. If you have a choice which movie to see first choose the first one because it will make you appreciate it a lot more than if you see the newer one first.

28 March 2021,"""WE ALL GO A LITTLE MAD SOMETIMES"" ...","""Psycho"" What a CLASSIC! It's just over 60 years old now and it still proves to be one of the greatest. Alfred Hitchcock is master filmmaker and ""Psycho"" is evidence of the geniuses work. The late ""Anthony Perkins"" kills it as the mamas boy motel clerk ""Norman bates"". The film is unpredictably intriguing and constantly showcases a vast range of challenges for the viewer. ""Hitchcock"" maintains a certain visual style, which is present in his other projects, such as 1963s ""The Birds"". The tone gets increasingly uncomfortable as the picture progresses. The camera work, script and musical score seamlessly blend together making the scenes more memorable. ""Psycho"" is up there with some of the greatest films ever made. Want a good movie to watch people, this is it...You'll not forget it.

""Bates Motel"" adapted from ""Psycho"" is a prequel TV show. It's great! I also recommend watching that.

6 August 2013,"Sorry, I am not that moved..","Many claims it to be Hitchcock's best but I disagree. 10/10 are from those who didn't see the twist coming. After watching Rear Window, I had high hopes for this one and well it was another wonderful movie too but didn't live up to the IMDb ratings and class expected in my opinion. Not that it isn't great, maybe I'm one of those 1 out of 100 people not to be fazed by this film. As the title of the film suggest, I anticipated the twist and it the part which is supposed to 'blow your mind' was way too predictable for me. But top notch direction again. The characters were strong and the suspense is well documented to thrill the audience, but this isn't Hitchcock's finest, not by a mile.

11 March 2006,Now that is what I call a movie!,"I agree with other posters that this is film, pure and simple. No social messages, no poignant emotion, just entertainment, plain, pure and simple. It is the type of horror film only the likes of it's fine British director could handle. Anthony Perkins gives a fine performance, and its too bad that this role is what ultimately ended up stereotyping his career. I found his character to be excellent, phsyco but not ""mad"".

As for Janet Leigh, well, lets just say I was kind of happy she died early on. The shower scene lives up to all it's expectations.

If you want to see real Hitchcock, see this.

27 December 2021,Good movie but,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8

22 October 2003,Psycho review,"Scream all you want, Psycho is the greatest horror flick of all time. Much of the praise is due to three ingenious elements directed by the great auteur Alfred Hitchcock: camerawork, editing, and sounds. Cleverly, our sympathy for first-half protagonist, Marian Crane (the beautiful Janet Leigh-mother of Jamie Lee Curtis), shifts towards a creepy commiseration for antagonist (?), Norman Bates. Both characters are indeed psychotic, though on different levels. We feel for Crane, knowing that her misdeed-scamming her boss out of $40,000-is wrong; and we're just as sure to be annoyed when an ominously curious state policeman tracks behind.

Indeed, several could relate to Marian Crane, having had the feeling of splitting from the real world and all its dilemmas before, or merely Arizona, in her case. Crane's destination is Los Angeles, assumingly comparative to the numerous venturing for more glory and escapism. On her way she decides to spend a night at an off-road dive; it's raining hard and who needs more with another pesky trooper? Rather than using the typical fat, old, balding loner from the Psycho novel, Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano employ a relatively more normal, attractive personality to exemplify the Bates Motel manager. With that, Anthony Perkins sets off one of film's greatest performances. For much of the second half, mama's boy Bates becomes the character we are more concerned about.

The cinematography in Psycho is as creepy as the plot. Shot in black and white, not because Hitchcock had to, but because he wanted to, our two main characters are followed in medium shot thoroughly at every step. Every reaction is recorded to its highest definition, from Bates searing eyeball scheming on his guest's undergarment, to Crane's multiple changes of expression when the pursuing officer veers right. Psycho is a non-stop showcase of vigorous zooming and follow-framing. What makes this formalist approach to film-making so great is its unconventionality. Alfred Hitchcock was keen on every detail, providing a window for viewers to snatch every bit.

Hitchcock also provided psychological clues to the story in his score, perhaps one of the top three to five greatest ever composed (even Busta Rhymes wanted to `Gimme Some More'). The screeching violin play chillingly reflects the screeching sounds of birds, symbolism often found throughout Psycho. Even the sudden clash of windshield wipers during Crane's stormy drive to Los Angeles is a conceivable preview to what lay ahead.

Perhaps nothing is more impressive, however, than the editing. Oftentimes the first thing mentioned about Psycho is the notorious `shower scene.' Aside from changing the entire landscape of the film, from a quickly-paced protagonist goal to a slower-moving character study, the scene contains a barrage of amazing edits. In this horrific slashing scene, we miss nudity and contact-gore if you will-yet, to much of our delight. The pacing of this classic montage is more attractive, in essence, because of its unpredictability. And with Hitchcock, why expect nothing else?

5/5 stars",10
7 March 2021,DONT UNDERESTIMATE THE AUDIENCE,"I liked the general pacing of the film. The blocking wasn't close to what we were used to seeing in Hitcock's movies but there were some memorable scenes. The only real problem I see in this groundbreaking picture is that it underestimates its audience by explaining everything at the end with the psychologist. The last scene with the transition was sensational.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
18 February 2004,"Probably, the greatest movie ever because of 2 people especially...","...and these people are the director (Alfred Hitchcock, whose work is simply matchless-everything can be copied, but the quality-) and, particularly, the leading actor (Anthony Perkins), absolutely insurmountable. It's a real pity (I'd rather say a shame) that he didn't earn either an Oscar nomination, because his work was perfect. That's my point of view: without Mr. Hitchcock, ""Psycho"" wouldn't have been the same; but without Tony Perkins, it simply wouldn't have been at all.

4 November 2012,A young female secretary from Pheonix finds herself in the hands of a suspicious mother and son who own the motel she is staying at.,"The cinematography for this film stood out to be as near perfection. The shower scene for which Marion is stabbed to death is deemed to be as skill-full as cinematography could get in this time period. The storyline was interesting and served as a bit of a mystery to the viewer. The acting was believable and they could not have possibly cast better actors for each role. The grim and sort of scary storyline stood out to among the films i've viewed from this time period. I liked how it was kept a secret until the end that Norman's mother was dead, although I kind of started to suspect this in the middle. It was unusual for the ""main character"" (Marion) to be killed off so early on, and this came as a bit of a shock to me. And surprises in films are what make them successful as opposed to predictable plots.This film is legendary in the history or horror films and set the bar for scary movies to come.

2 March 2016,Anthony Perkins,"WOW. I'd heard a lot (like all of us, probably) about this movie but I hadn't actually watched until last night.

Anthony Perkins' performance was so good!

His face transformed so many times.

He looks both like a nice boy and a scary one. His nervous ticks and air of sweetness and menace! *clapping*.

The fact that Perkins could never escape this role proves that he played the part perhaps too well.

And that ending, I wasn't expecting that! Marvellous.

This is my first review, I'm sorry if I made a mistake!",7
27 May 2010,Iconic film,"""Psycho"" is unquestionably one of the finest films of all time, and probably the greatest thriller (although there are several other contenders, all directed by Hitchcock). The acting is first-rate; the cinematography is superb; and the musical score (by Bernard Herrmann) is iconic. (Incredibly, the score did not receive an Oscar nomination.) Hitchcock has been deservedly praised for his direction, but I feel it is time to give credit where credit is due. I recently read the book on which the movie was based, also titled ""Psycho"". It was written by Robert Bloch in 1959, a year before the movie was made. Except for two scenes that weren't in the book, and a couple of memorable lines (most notably, ""Well, a boy's best friend is his mother""), the movie follows the book so closely that almost all of the credit should go to the author of the book, not the director of the movie. If you have seen and enjoyed the movie, pick up a copy of the book. Only then can you appreciate who the real genius was behind ""Psycho"".

There are quite a few, mostly minor, differences between the book and movie. As I read the book, I wondered why the changes had been made. Here are some examples. In the movie, Ms. Crane's name is Marion; in the book, it is Mary. In the movie, she lives and works in Phoenix, Arizona; in the book, she is from Ft. Worth, Texas. In the movie, Norman Bates is thin and young; in the book, he is fat and middle-aged. In the book, he wears glasses; in the movie, he doesn't. In the movie, there are twelve cabins at the motel; in the book, there are six. I found no fewer than thirty-five differences, but almost none of them made any sense to me.",10
18 June 2017,Profound film!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

31 July 2017,Terrible love,"I have met this movie for the first time. I felt that this movie was the kind of horror all the time, because in a play the multiple murder were repeated and the fact of matter wasn't shown at the end. Moreover, the sound track gave us the feeling of impatience and tension.

I think that ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"" have something in common with women. In ""Vertigo"" Scottie tried to appropriate Madeline for his personal use by making ideal woman. Whereas in ""Psycho"" there is the description comparing women to stuffed birds from Norman's lines. I felt that these express the men's will wanting to make women their own. I wonder if women are passive compared with men is really the case.

Also, this film shows strange relationship of gender, because Norman and his mother have the reference of incest in Norman's brain. Of course mother and son are not lover but family by thinking about blood relationship from commonsense. So the love of between parent and child is ""abnormal"". That unusual love invaded Norman's spirit and ate in his heart. That sounds like so terrible.",7

28 October 2022,Classic Hitchcock Movie,"I Have seen this when i first got it, This is more great when i first saw it

And i knew what happens, but still a classic movie!

When it was first released, all it has was the cut version on VHS, Laserdisc, DVDs, and Blu rays. That is until the uncut version is released.

But i won't tell about a plot of this movie, cuz people who seen it already knew what happened.

1960, the day it was first released had people screaming, it is still scary. On top of that Hitchcock's Film Adaption from a book is still great after all these years, Germany has the uncut version for a while It Is Still A Classic Even To This Day.

4 March 2023,Once is Enough,"See it once and that is enough. Not an epoch film. When I read the novel, it really creeped me out. Not long after I watched the film and was disappointed. The only thing I liked in it were the story (which is absolutely the same as in the book), b/w cinematography and acting from Anthony Perkins. Shower scene and the scene when Bates runs in his mother's outfit were hilarious. What makes the film good is its story. Thanks to Robert Bloch, not Alfred Hitchcock! And come on, Hitchcock is overrated. Most of his films are very theatrical and acting in them is not credible. Hickcock criticizes other dramatic producers for their method of surprise but it exactly his method. I'm sure he is a kick at Hollywood parties.

15 December 2010,The first true slasher film,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8

19 December 2012,Classic Horror film,"Definitely still one of my favorite movies done by Alfred Hitchcock and one of the greatest horror films of all times. I absolutely love horror movies and modern ones have nothing on this classic horror film. There is something more realistic about this psychopath that makes this movie a great scare. This movie also shows that you don't need blood and gore to get your point across and scary and audience. Such a fantastic set of actor playing well in dept characters that really make the movie. The photographic detail and cinematography is what really adds to the scary edge of the film, not to mention the music that gets your heart pumping.

13 May 2016,Psycho (1960),"This is a brilliant film. It takes a little bit of getting used to, it can come off as a little corny at first, but once you get sucked into it, the movie is amazing. I believe that is pretty much paved the way for every single horror movie after it. It is a testament to the genius of Alfred Hitchcock. He really understood suspense and how it effects the audience. The Shots in the is film are brilliantly planned out. They make you think exactly what you are supposed to think, until you learn what is really happening. I already knew what was going to happen when I saw this movie, yet it was still shocking. that is what makes it so great.

13 July 2016,Scary but Great,"I watch this film in Professor Fitzsimons' class. The title, ""Psycho"", gives me the scary impression. I am afraid of shocking bloody scenes like murders, wars and accidents, so I watch the film through fear. Marion stoles money because she wants to marry his boyfriend, Sam. It is the beginning of tragedy and mystery. I watch it, with wondering who psycho is. At first, I think Marion is psycho because she stoles money and loses her credibility for so private reason, but she is not, contrary to my expectation. It interests me more in what is going to happen next or in the end. I get chills when I find who psycho is. He or she looks nice and kind in the first half of the film. I am so shocked and I nearly lapse into a distrust of humanity. However I don't hate such a surprise ending. As I said, I don't like shocking scene, so I couldn't watch the scene of murder. However, I was enough scared by the background music. It works very well to cause a lot of tension and to fill my heart with fear. This film is old, but I have heard it (maybe on ""Finding Nemo"" by Pixar). I think the background music is so famous that it is used for other movie or TV programme, also great and important for the film. Finally, please let me say this. I like Hitchcock's skills in expression. In the first half, he places taxidermy naturally and in the end, he expresses someone like taxidermy. Although I don't understand this without professor's explanation, I am moved by Hitchcock's ability and expressive power.",
12 August 2017,Horror and scary film,"This film is thrilling and shocking. In the beginning, I guessed that this is about money because money is a familiar theme, but this film is about the relationship between a man and his mother. Marion drops by a motel where Norman operates on the way to steal money and see Sam, her lover. And then, the story develops unexpectedly. The way Norman speaks and his odd collection of stuffed birds make me feel weird and thrilling, after that strange murders happen repeatedly, but I couldn't imagine who causes. Especially, the background music is effective for this film. Thanks to BGM and camera works, this film successfully builds scary and tension. Norman has an excessive attachment on his mother and looks eccentric. This film relates to complicated mental disease and criminal emotion. That setting is elaborated and interesting. He is so psychotic that this film scares me. I was also surprised and impressed by the ending.

Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
16 November 2020,More than a Thriller,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power.

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament.

20 February 2004,is it mystery? is it suspense? no! it's PSYCHO!,"Alfred Hitchcock, born in 1899, is known as the `Master of Suspense.' Becoming a director in 1925, he has been entertaining people ever since. One of the classics, and probably close to the most widely known, is Psycho, made in 1960.

Now putting into fact that they didn't have much to work with concerning special effects in those times, this movie may not be the most frightening ever. But, special effects aren't what Hitchcock was all about. He was a man of mystery and always wanted to keep tension between the viewer and the film. He could create the perfect scene by moving the angle of the shot just one certain way. Filming techniques and plot seem to be his forte.

In Psycho, one method that Hitchcock used to create a dramatic scene is the placement of the camera shots. For instance, in a ""get away,"" he would film the character while they were in a car, then show a scene out of the car. He repeated this same idea, coming closer to their face every time it re-entered the car...so close that it almost makes the viewer uncomfortable.

Another aspect of Hitchcock's movies that makes them very memorable are the sets and the way that the characters move, talk and act. For example, a character may stutter, fidget, or talk fast when presented with certain situations. With sets and designs, he always tried to play with the look and feel of a scene. The mansion that was used in this movie created a very mysterious aura around it. This could be because of the placement, which was, on top of a dark hill with many ascending steps. It could also be because the lighting was always dim and never really showed the details, creating wonder and mystery.

Obtaining an overall 8.6/10 stars, this movie is clearly brilliantly made, being loved by millions. With drama, suspense, a good plot and a great director, you've created a masterpiece.",9
16 December 2011,psycho,"Psycho is a movie I have seen more than once in my life. It was usually for different reasons each time, but I have always been a fan of Alfred Hitchcock. I like how the movie is twisted and the characters are very interesting to me. I also like the fact that it's in black and white and I think that the music makes all the difference in the movie. I loved the camera work in this movie as well. The perspective views and then some of the close up were almost abstract in my opinion, but I defiantly enjoyed this film. I think that this film created a lot of suspense in the plot line. The music was also a benefactor in creating drama or suspense as well. I never lost interest in what was happening in the film.

The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",4
19 December 2012,Psycho,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

19 August 2018,Alfred Hitchcock is a god and Perkins is Jesus,"One of the best movies i have seen, Perkins did a really good job as Norman Bates. Really good script, not once in the movie did I wonder when the credits would roll.

This movie showed what real horror is, that you don't need all this splitter splatter, jump scares and loud nosies. Hitchcock made a brilliant and exciting movie and all the actors did very well.

This movie is one of the best horror movies ever and really changed the horror genre for ever.

14 December 2016,Best suspense movie!,"I like this movie! Because of this movie, I starts look for suspense movie. because of this movie, Hitchcock becomes the best movie director for me. He is a genius to make a suspense movie. The cinematography in this movie is fantastic. it uses a lot of unusual shooting angle to build the suspense atmosphere and hide the real answer inside those wired view. The lighting is another Hitchcock symbol for this movie. But this movie becomes the top one for me is the ending. It has the most dramatic ending. Also this ending just ends at the final answer came out. No more extra shot to explain this. Viewers have to imagine how the real ends will be.

15 February 1999,I've always wanted to say this.,"I thought the ending was poorly rendered in comparison to the rest of the film. The ending is sometimes laughable if you are in the right mood. The rest of the film couldn't be better though. I think most people remember the shower scene vividly. But Janet Leigh is great as the thief. It's her movie as much as his.

15 April 2021,Psycho-An Horror Classic,"Without a doubt, a horror classic. The slow, methodical pace of this movie reminds me so much of the Halloween/Michael Myers series. Alfred Hitchcock knocked this out of the park. The atmosphere kept my eyes glued to the screen all throughout and just like Halloween ,the score is something that is a main takeaway. Not as gory as some other horror movies but I feel like this movie has continued to age because of the directing, 100% committed actors and once again, that iconic score.

9 February 2013,best suspense thriller,"finest work from Alfred Hitchcock. ever since we visited universal studios some 6 years back, and saw the motel site, we wanted to see the movie. the day came yesterday. beautiful story, told with wonderful performances from the artists. every one has done complete justice. the movie is definitely scary and keeps the viewer on his toes. the most astonishing fact is that in 1960s, they made this film. Norman Bates comes out a clear winner for his performance. undoubtedly, the best every suspense thriller. this film is proof that no big budgets required to produce quality films. the 1960s set up looks so innocent, with boys cleanly shaved and wearing tiew, neatly dressed. this film will remain an all time favorite for generations to come.

2 June 2010,You can't predict what's going to happen...,"You can try to predict what's going to happen next in this movie but 99.9% chances are that all your predictions would be wrong. First of all your prediction will keep changing about the ending as the movie progresses and 99.9% chances are that your prediction still going to be wrong and you will be shocked when you witness the end.

This is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie and in my opinion the best Alfred Hitchcock movie. This is a revolutionary movie that revolutionized Hollywood, gave and still giving inspiration to many many filmmakers of horror and suspense movies and gave new meaning to the word 'horror.'

In my opinion this movie is the best suspense-thriller movie ever made and one of the greatest and memorable movies of all time.

16 November 2009,Holy Psycho,"I really thought this movie was done well. The ending a surprise. Loved it. In the beginning I wasn't sure how this movie was going to be any kind of thriller or horror. I thought in the beginning the lighting was a lot better than in the end. Towards the end everything was so dark.I believe that to go along with the story the lighting fit in perfectly. I also noticed the music in the background they did an amazing job with that it was just in the right places even if there wasn't something bad going to happen you thought there was going to be. I think the plot was great and it kept you guessing. I guess this is why Hitchcock was so famous. Megan

6 May 2003,Hitchock's Masterpiece,"This was the first really terrifying movie that audiences were ever to witness. Directed by perhaps the greatest of all time in Alfred Hitchcock, Psycho displays the first psychotic killer in film. Very few have had the same impact as Norman Bates when you think there is Freddy Krueger, Jason, Dr Hannibal Lecter and of course the killers from the Scream movies. I think it is only Lecter that matches up to Norman Bates. To the violence driven teenagers of today, ""Psycho"" is a film that they probably will not respect or fully understand, but for those who are willing to try this a film that you MUST see. This is the FIRST movie to terrify viewers and the final scene will stay with you for some time.

19 February 2004,Stabbing in the Shower!!!!,"In the opening scene of Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock does a terrific job by playing the dissonant overture of music in the beginning while rolling the credits. In which is giving viewers a taste of what the movie is going to be like beginning to end. As most of us know, Hitchcock is known for holding viewers in suspense during his movies. He is, without a doubt, `The master of suspense.'

When Marian Crane (Janet Lee) is fleeing town, that is where the suspense starts. At that point, she is stopped at a traffic light, and people are crossing the cross walk. The man who walks in front of her boss in the crosswalk is Alfred Hitchcock. A typical Alfred Hitchcock film always has him playing a small part, such as a man smoking a pipe while reading a newspaper. After Alfred Hitchcock Walks in front of her car, her boss walks right behind him, and notices Marian in the car. She then notices her boss, and took off.

As she is driving down the road, she has voices running in her head about stolen money, while the dissonant music plays in the background. First time viewers think this is when she dies, but she doesn't until later. That just goes to show how Alfred Hitchcock is, `The master of suspense.'

Hitchcock has an interesting way of making movies, too. He was the first person ever to come up with the dissonant music for horror films. His lighting and camera techniques are also interesting. For example, when Marian is being followed by the cop, the camera shows an angle of the cop car in the rear view mirror of her car.

Not every movie is perfect, though. In the bathroom at the Bates motel, also known as the classic shower stabbing scene, Marian gets murdered. As Marian is screaming, this reviewer noticed that she giggled a little bit. Other than that, the part it was perfect. If you haven't seen Psycho before, but want to see it, then sit down and watch it till it is done.",9

Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",

29 January 2023,"Come On, ... !","Believe whatever you see!

First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens.

There are really only a couple of scenes that were ""horrific"" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie.

Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention.

The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night.

Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. A lot has already been said about this film, so I won't comment too much on what it's actually about, and instead I'll only comment on significance and my reactions to it.

""Psycho"" has a plot based heavily in reality: adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, the book and film were loosely based on the crimes of real-life Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein.

""Psycho"" finds its story revolving around Marion Crane (the late Janet Leigh), a lowly Phoenix, Arizona, secretary who embezzles $40,000 from her boss and hits the road, later stopping in at the isolated Bates Motel, and meets the owner and sole employee of the establishment, Norman Bates (the late Anthony Perkins).",8
13 July 2007,The craft of film-making brought to perfection,"There is no finer example of the craft of film-making than ""Psycho."" Every aspect of the production is brilliantly executed, and contributes to the film as a whole, rather than detracting from the whole. The script laden with double meanings, the note-perfect acting, the astonishing camera work and editing, the background music, the sleazy, run-down atmosphere - it all coalesces into one unforgettable excursion through the prurient, dishonest, anxiety-ridden substratum that lies just an inch beneath the supposedly placid, polite surface of American society. Hitchcock masterfully manipulates not only the audience's emotional states but its train of thought as well. The viewer is kept in a subtle state of confusion and bewilderment as to what is actually happening, what is going to happen, and what the characters' true motivations are - while at the same time the story is propelled forward at a brisk and steady pace. Even though I have seen this film all the way through 6 or 7 times, I always find myself irresistibly drawn into it all over again whenever it is shown. This is one of the true masterpieces of cinema, in that it exemplifies masterful film-making in all the disciplines required to produce a great film.",10

27 October 2022,Realistic Horror,"The idea of fear instilled by Alfred Hitchcock in this timeless thriller remains relevant even today in the new millenium.

The story, narration, simple facts and the acting of the actors are phenomenol to say the least.

Every actor suited the role to the T and the moments that built up the premise, the experimentation with a rather sensitive topic like a mental condition of a person way back in the 60s wasn't very prevalent in mainstream cinema.

But as they say legends become legends as they dare to do things differently and succeed being fully aware of the risks involved in making the movie.

I would say irrespective of the number of years passsed since having made the movie, if you get a chance to watch it, do not miss it at any cost.",8

19 October 2012,Psycho review,"I would recommend this movie to anyone. I'm not one for suspense, but I liked this movie. On the other hand, I personally wouldn't call it a horror film. But for when it was made it is pretty accurate. I thought all the lighting and sound was perfect, I didn't notice anything jumping out at me with those two categories. I thought the camera angles and shots were well done too. What I did notice though, was the pacing of the film. I thought it started out slower and was fast at the end. Overall I liked the twist, I thought it was a good movie to watch and I would watch it again. It kept me entertained the whole time, and waiting for whatever was next.

18 February 2004,Definitely the best horror film of all time,"""Psycho"" has been called the best horror movie of all time, and it's no surprise that it has considering that it was directed by The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock, who has directed (and sometimes produced) 53 films,

was definitely successful with this one. It makes no difference that 'Psycho"" is a 1960 film, it is just as good, if not better, than any horror film made today. The film has an eeriness to it. Even though it is not constant killing after killing, it is still very creepy. The biggest factor contributing to the ""on the edge of your seat"" feeling in the film is the music. Throughout the entire film the music is unsettling, suspenseful, and it gives the viewer an uncomfortable feeling that is hard to explain. A scene as simple as someone driving in a car can become

intense and even a little scary once the music begins. It is never dull and it is always interesting. There is no doubt that ""Psycho"" without it's fast paced, loud, and startling music would not be the truly terrifying film that it is. Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, the psycho. Perkins' acting job is very

well done and actually really believable. He doesn't need to stick with one type of acting to be good. He can be a nice guy, he can be mad, he can be sad, he can even behave as a lunatic and in all situations his acting is realistic. When it comes to Anthony Perkins' acting job in ""Psycho"" there is no cheesiness to be found. There are many other great performances by great actors/actresses in ""Psycho."" Such as Janet Leigh as Marianne Crane, Vera Miles as Lila Crane, and John

Gavin as Sam Lumus. While all of their acting jobs are believable and

entertaining to watch, there are a few times when they may have overdone it or come across as cheesy. But put those times aside and you're left with one very good actor and two very good actresses. Besides, nobody's perfect. ""Psycho"" is a black and white film that takes place mostly at night. Because of that, some of the backgrounds in a few scenes don't look as realistic as they could. The viewer may be able to tell that they aren't real and if they are real the viewer is likely to think that they aren't. This does not take away from the film at all. Regardless of some cheesy acting or backgrounds that look fake, ""Psycho"" is

still the best horror film of all time, and there's no arguing with that.",10
23 March 2004,interesting,"Everyone has told me that this film put Alfred Hitchcock on the map. Anyone who watches this film will ultimately be able to tell why. He is a marvelous man that uses more then people to connect you to the screen. Music, this mainly tells you when something suspenseful is going to happen but Alfred uses it almost completely through out the film. The reason I feel is to keep you on your seats, because you don't know what is going to happen next. Then the lighting, mostly dim and eerie but in times that you need to see something its bright and almost blinding. Lastly the setting, gives you the creeps because its as if you are all alone in this little area and no one can save you. These things add character to the film, as if these did not exist then the film would no longer be a suspense. I have learned a few things from this film, 1) Not all black and white movies are bad. 2) Alfred is a genius with his imaginative ways and ability to create masterpieces that are still enormously watched today. 3) No matter what you think you learn to appreciate things more as you grow older. Though these things do not really state anything this is what I am going to say now. This film was and still is a classic though this being the first time I have ever saw it. I will never forget this film and most likely from time to time rent it again. I have never really had an appreciation for black and white films, except (Casablanca) and now this one. Being that I grew up with color and I never knew anything other wise. But not having color makes your imagination grow and your ability to pick out more interesting things in the film.",

14 March 2004,a chilling thriller,"Psycho was the movie that put Alfred Hitchcock on the map and leads to his great career. Psycho is an all time thriller and suspense movie for all people. Ten minutes into the film you're on the edge of your seat asking yourself what's going to happen next. Hitchcock was great with developing his characters and the plot. As you sit and watch the film you are amazed by the genius of Hitchcock on the way that he not only shoots the film but also the lighting and music. The lighting helps make everything seem eerie, and the music puts chills down your spin. The plot twists will keep your head spinning and is mind blowing. Through all this suspense you may even find some humor. As you meet the characters one by one you hope that you will never be in their situation. The reviewer would highly recommend this film to everyone, even if you don't like scary movies. The reviewer would rate this film 10/10.

20 February 2004,great suspense,"This movie will definitely keep you on your toes. It is a great suspense with creativity and an amazing plot that keeps the viewer interested the whole time.

Psycho is about a woman named Marion Crane who is on the run for stealing $40,000 and while on the run she is encountered with well, a Psycho. This is a film the viewer needs to see for themselves and not ask any questions to a person who has seen it because the suspense is so great.

The acting was well done in this film. Janet Leigh who played Marion Crane had the most notable performance. She portrayed a sweet, but yet paranoid and guilty crook very well. Anthony Perkins who played Norman Bates also did a great job portraying his character.

What made this movie so amazing is the directing. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in film making. If it wasn't for him, horror films wouldn't be the way they are today. His techniques formed great suspense. The music he chose illustrated the anticipation of the film notably. Comparing this movie to the new version of Psycho which was made in 1998 is incredibly different. Even though the 1998 version was almost identical to the 1960s version, nothing compares to Alfred Hitchcock's version, proving that his techniques of using black and white film makes the film appear scarier. His original camera angles make him truly a great director that sets him apart from the other directors.

This is a must see film! Though it is not the scariest movie out there the ingenuity of Psycho makes it one of the best horror films of all time. Psycho was a definite trendsetter for current horror films.

This movie is 10/10 stars.",10
11 May 2012,Thriller,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine.

2 February 2014,Hitchcock's Ultimate Masterpiece!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered.

23 September 2016,spell-binding.,"I know exactly how to go about this, I daresay. I'm gonna begin by clearing the air as regards one defining aspect of the movie, namely that it is black and white. Now, you can rest assured- the quality is impeccable, as there are lots of movies of lower quality out there; the cast, in addition,is top-notch.And I mean it. AAAnd the black-and- white thing , if anything, is a huge PERK. You heard me! it is an advantage, amounting, all in all, to the uncertain and suspenseful vibe that the movie conveys.

Anyhow, I'm gonna be short and sweet as this is not a book review and nobody (at least I know for a thing that I detest them) really goes in for lengthy comments.

The bottom line is that this tour-de-force is a must. A M U S T. and it isn't so because your teacher says so , or some haughty maven crows about it. It is because a friend says so- with a mere interest that people should watch art and good movies instead of preposterous time-wasters. This movie is the best psychological thriller I've ever seen( and certainly the great masterpiece people make it out to be). And there are a great deal of them. I'm not gonna ramble on about this, as there are a couple of movies that come close , but after pondering my choice well enough, I can assert that this is the best all-around, a cut above the competitors, and puts some of the nowadays tentative horror-things to shame, as the principles are timeless.

Pick it, no second thoughts about it. I'm gonna say just this- this is even better than Fight Club, as it is better proportioned in terms of length-content , and needless to say other praiseworthy works such as American Psycho.",10

30 May 2004,True Movie Making Mastery,"Perhaps the scariest movie ever made, Psycho proves that talented writing, editing and directing is the key to great movies. Alfred Hitchcock shows that gore and gratuitous sex are not needed to scare, excite and arouse viewers. Much like a beautiful woman who knows how to dress, it's what you don't see that attracts all the wonder. I guarantee Psycho will scare the heck out of anyone who watches it. They to remember is that you have to be the detective here. You have to figure out what exactly is going on inside the Bates Motel. Don't worry, the answers will come. In the meantime, your mind will be kept free of irrelevant (and untalented) scenes of blood, guts and lust so that you can figure it out.

27 June 2005,i love this movie,"this movie was great. and not great in the kind of way where you see a movie and they blow lots of stuff up and your like, that was awesome. its all in the suspense and the editing. everything comes together perfectly, script, casting, acting, camera-work, sound. the sound of the stabbing was one of the most unsettling noises i've ever heard. i think this might also have the lowest body count of any horror movie ever. another thing that makes it so great is the irony, but i don't want to spoil it for you. there is also a great amount of dramatic forshadowning, and symbolism, along with looks at the nature of the human mind. I love this movie, its great maybe the best movie i've ever seen, ten out of ten

23 November 2004,Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho changed movie history.,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is the tale of a momma's boy. I guess you could say that Anthony Perkins's chilling portrayal of Norman Bates take the phrase momma's boy to an extreme. Just a boy and his mother living alone. Nothing wrong with that. At least Janet Leigh's character, Marion, doesn't think so. She's stressed, so she steals $40,000 and finds herself at the Bates' Motel where she has a nice dinner with Norman-and goes to take a shower. For it was there, in the shower at the Bates' Motel, that the most horrifying and controversial scene in horror movie history took place. And little did Marion know that that one shower made the movie what it is today.

17 February 2004,We are all a little psycho sometime...,"Of all things in the 1960's, one must be afraid of someone going psycho. No, I'm not referring to psychedelics, but psychotic people. Now, in any case there is always a psycho person roaming about. Though aren't we all a little psycho at one point? Which brings me to a point that at some point people tend to go into the dark side. Total control blinded by instinctual desires of a greater existence. Though what end will one end up? That's what I feel about the aura of the movie Psycho' by Alfred Hitchcock.

In most suspense movies, or even horror the most crucial element is sound. Now, the music for the film created a tense feel, which made it feel subtly unsettling. As I delved into the score I felt a little bit cheated by the repetitious use of the theme song throughout the movie. This did not however take away from the suspense.

Movies like this are not to be spoiled. For the way the movie was filmed it created a sense of mystery. While certain key elements of the plot play through, Hitchcock was a master at distorting the truth. Having the camera at an angle to not see a face, or make it seem very closed in. Under these styles of filming the suspense lasts throughout the entire picture.

Now, I'll be brief on the shower scene. Everyone and their mother have at least heard of this scene. The woman was Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who is also the main character. Well, as I watched this scene in its entirety I was a little shocked by how it was filmed. Now I know it must have been painfully hard to film the scene and not reveal too much skin. Though how it was done was more artistic as opposed real.

Finally Hitchcock is a man of many surprises. To build a multi-perspective on what is going on in a film has been adapted into many works after his time. For this movie I would gladly recommend this to anyone, who can see past its age. Though I feel this film has the strength to live on. I guess it is how Hitchcock used his skills. His movies are bittersweet. One part all is well, and the other part is psycho.",

19 February 2004,Everyone's a little crazy,"40,000 dollars in stolen money, a beautiful woman and a lonely motel owner combine to create one of the greatest psychological thrillers ever created for the big screen. Alfred Hitchcock, the undisputed `Master of Suspense', does his best work with this film. After just one viewing, it's easy to see why this film is rated so highly on the AFI's 100 best list and countless other film review lists. Right from the opening shots of the movie, you can tell it's the work of a master. Well executed camera movements drop you right into the story and you're hooked from there on. Fantastic photography in classic black and white is accentuated by great lighting. The film style and lighting combine to create eerie shadows and an overall sense of uneasiness that's hard not to notice. In addition, composer Bernard Hermann lends one of the most chilling and well recognized scores to the film, adding even more to the thrilling layers of the story.

`Psycho' is more of a psychological thriller than a horror flick, contrary to what a lot of people think. It's a film that's comparable to Silence of the Lambs, if you can compare the two. The thing that makes this film such a thriller is the great acting from the stars, Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Perkins is evil at times and friendly at others. He pulls off one of the best schizophrenic acting gigs ever recorded on film. Leigh and Perkins have very good chemistry together, especially in the scene which takes place in the motel parlor. Very creepy.

`Psycho' is a well written and filmed piece of work. It's such a terrifying story that's made even more so by good technical execution. It's a gripping story with some good twists that leads up to a terrifying climax. It's a good thrill even for those squeamish few who don't enjoy blood. It's more of a mental horror from one of the best creators of suspense films. This is one of Hitchcock's best works. Check it out and you won't take a shower for a week.

Overall grade for `Psycho': A",

17 January 2014,Psycho: No one. Absolutely No ONE will be admitted after the film has started,"Psycho. This is a movie that basically everyone in the United States of America has seen or will see, and it should be seen by every one its a great movie. But let's take a look at why it's so great. For starters Psycho is chock full of nerve tingling suspense that's probably one of the movie's greatest strengths. The suspense is handled so well by Alfred Hitchcock , after all the guy's nickname is the master of suspense. Other great strengths that this movie offers is it's amazing performance by it's lead actor Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, he plays a great character who has been broken by his mother to insanity. The rest of the cast does a fine job too especially Janet Leight. The movie is also full of so many twist and turns most of these are common knowledge now but back in 1960 no one knew what hit them. The music, we cant forget Bernard Herman's excellent music score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly, the music was most famously used in the shower scene now one of cinema's most recognizable moments.The twist ending is great it will catch you completely off guard. Psycho; a movie full of twists and turns, suspense at every corner, perfect music, great acting and all lead by probably the greatest film director of all times, Psycho does receive from me a 9.5 out of 10. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop whatever your doing and see it now.",10
25 November 2019,Aren't we all afraid of becoming our mother?,"A real Freudian nightmare. The suspense of Marion's chase, the shower scene, the emotion filled eyes, the surreal house on the hill... I feel that Hitchcock mastered a lot of tone and implicit character dynamic just through camera angles. The last scene is awesome, when Lila discovers Norman's crazy secret.

27 April 2016,What can I say?,"Yes, this movie is a classic. It is hard to say something that has not already been said before about this film. So many classic scenes, music, etc, etc. I watched this in two different cinema classes, and we talked about it in my third cinema class. I have watched it a good few times and I will say that it is a good movie, but there are certain movies that are too dissected and too reviewed and they lose their magic. For some people, this does not happen, but for me, it does. Pieces of work done by artists should just be free to interpretation, not to reviews or dissection. This probably does not make sense, and I am sorry. I hope this was somehow informative, but it probably was not.

17 February 2006,My #12 favorite film of all time,"It goes without saying that Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is easily his best film. The best horror film ever made. The best surprise ending ever unveiled. And the best Anthony Perkins film ever (although that isn't saying much).

One of the most revolutionary films ever made, Psycho has so many thrills and shocks ever made. What might look like child's play to today's audience, must have completely blown away the minds of movie-goers from its time. Hitchcock throws caution to the wind and it pays off big time. What no other director would dare to put on screen, he does with surprising bluntness.

To reveal Psycho's secrets to someone who hasn't seen it would be crime. The score of Herrman is the real star of the film that gives it a legendary status. No other film score has ever added more depth and intensity to propel a story. A truly horrifyingly great stay at the Bates Motel. Mother knows best.",10
7 October 2008,Love It......,"One of the most famous movies of all time, and quite possibly influential horror film in history, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho traded the supernatural beings of the genres past Vampires, werewolves, zombies and the like for an all too human monster. The film made Norman Bates a household name and permanently guaranteed its director's status as the master of suspense.

Psycho is a curious shocker devised by the master of suspense Hitchcock as a tease and received most critics as an unpleasant horror piece. After enormous commercial success it achieved classic status over the years, despite effective moments of fright, it has a childish plot and script and its interest is that of a tremendously successful confidence trick, made for very little money. Probably the most visual, most cinematic picture he has ever made. I think the film is a reflection of a most unpleasant mind, a mean, sly, sadistic mind.

After many talks about a remake finally one come with Psycho in 1998 starring Julianne Moore, William H Macy and well. A terrible actor called Vince Vaughn. This version isn't a sacrilege, it's just pointless. To those who like the remake it is all very well having your tongue praising the film, but it does help having a brain in your skull. It also spawned two sequels and a TV series starring Lori Petty. The first sequel is a reasonably inventive sequel, if on the gory side. It probably holds the record for longest delayed follow up.

The narrative is very unusual for its date of release as there are two separate narrative strands. The storyline firstly is from Marion stealing the money which is helped along with misleading the audience into believing that the patrolman and Marion will be a story about a girl who steals money. The film has influenced many other especially What Lies Beneath which is literally a Hitchcock Pastiche. I also like that it is black and white photography as the blood colour (red) was to gruesome to show in 1960. And also it was less budget. What I like about the film is that it lends to the horror genre like Silence Of The Lambs is that they have no actual supernatural undertones even slashers like Halloween and Friday The 13th have supernatural undertones; honestly how many times can you be shot and survive only to appear in another.

The film is definitely one of my favourites. Like Spielberg's Jaws, Coppola's The Godfather, Lynch's Blue Velvet, this is his best film.",9
18 January 2009,Screech!,"Hitchcock is clearly the master of thrillers. This masterpiece shows the cooperation of thrills, a schizophrenic psycho and good dialog better than any other film.

Some of the most iconic scenes are in this movie: the shower scene and the basement scene, to mention two of them. No movie has been aped so much as psycho, peering through a hole, hid behind a painting, shadows of the murderer looming up behind you, delightful plot twists, and yet such a great style.

Camera's vanishing in the eye of a murdered woman, atmospherically depicted murder, the music, just, everything's great about this film. The final scene has been spooking in my mind for times, and, if you see this movie, you'll know why.

22 February 2004,Roller Coaster Thrill Ride,"What an incredible movie! Coming from a person who absolutely HATES scary movies, that's a lot to say. Not to shoot down Psycho, it was an amazingly scary movie, it would have been even worse had I seen it back in the sixties when it first came out. With the way the movie industry makes horror movies now a days, with all the guts and gore, Psycho was definitely a head of it's time when it was released.

Alfred Hitchcock was a talented director, a master of the macabre to say the least, and his quirky traits popped up here and there throughout Psycho. First off, as with his other movies, Hitchcock makes an appearance so look for him during the first fifteen minutes or so. Another quirky characteristic was his obsession with the bathroom, or better yet with the words bowel movement. This is evident with the initials of the Bates Motel. Idiosyncrasies like these make and otherwise terrifying movie more enjoyable for the viewer because knowing Hitchcock's habits, they can look for these types of things throughout Psycho. And definitely look for them, because there are a lot more things to pick up on than just the two mentioned above.

It's not just Hitchcock's eccentricities that make him a great director, his foreshadowing plotline and intense cinematography make it hard to beat. With the first appearance of the Bates Motel and mansion, you can tell bad things are going to ensue. The hotel itself isn't all that scary, creepy yes, but not edge-of-your-seat terrifying. Unlike the mansion, one look at the sinister house on top of the hill will send chills down your spine. Clearly something bad has happened or will happen there. As for the notorious shower scene, the camera angles used allowed Hitchcock to create a truly chilling scene without all the guts and gore of today.

All in all, this was a impressive movie for the time, one that all horror movies since should try to live up to. Alfred Hitchcock created something truly ahead of the time, a movie that no other horror movie can compare to, and for that I think it deserves ten out of ten stars.",
15 May 2014,When is too much Hitchcock too much Hitchcock?,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",7

6 May 2016,The best classic horror film to date,"Psycho is without question in my mind, the most intrigued and best display of a thriller/horror film to date. Beginning with Alfred Hitchcock's iconic style, Psycho is a classic Hitchcock film in its anxious, innovative, voyeuristic, and suspenseful camera angles and movements. The film also has a great twist ending that Hitchcock often favored in his films. The voyeuristic camera angles gives the film suspense and anxiety as you feel like you're there watching the violence unfold. Hitchcock pushed the envelope of the time with Psycho and its inherent sex and violence which aids in its timelessness. The story is riveting and kept me engrossed through the films entirety. The events unfold in true Hitchcock fashion leading up to a brilliant climax with a compelling twist. Anthony Perkins' adept performance as the charismatic yet suspicious Norman Bates only aded to the film's grace and tact. Norman Bates' character development is amazing to watch as it is slowly fed to us little by little; as well as other characters such as Marion and Lila Crane, or Norma Bates. Psycho is a classic horror movie that defined the very essence of the horror and psychological thriller genre. It is a film i throughly enjoyed and will continue to enjoy as it is highly re-watchable to me. The film is just simply, perfectly executed.",10

14 June 2003,Brilliance.,"What can I say. Alfred Hitchcock was a genius. This has to be one of his best works.

PSYCHO is about a woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who, instead of depositing some money like she is supposed to, takes it for herself and goes on the run. She feels as if she's about to be caught, so she checks into the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). During her stay there, she is murdered. So is the detective who comes searching for her. Nobody can figure out what happened.

PSYCHO is one of those rare movies that is near-perfect. Hitchcock can create such suspense in a way that no one else can. All of the acting is supreme, and the plot is just remarkable. It's a little confusing at first, as you wonder who the murderer is, but it is entirely cleared up by the end. That's refreshing amidst movies like MULHOLLAND DR. and MEMENTO, that leave many loose ends for you to tie up. PSYCHO does not do this, which I liked about it. And the ending ... absolutely gave me chills.

10 out of 10. One of the best horror movies of all time.",
20 February 2004,a classic and creative film,"Psycho has to be one of the best and most classic horror films of all time. Alfred Hitchcock was very smart and creative about the techniques that he used which is why they have become a major part in filmmaking today.

The movie starts out with Marion (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin) in a hotel room. She wants to marry Sam, but neither of them have the money, especially Sam; he had to give most of his money away in alimony. When Marion goes to work, her boss asks her to deposit $40,000. Knowing that she could start a new life with the large sum of money, Marion takes off with it and the suspense begins. While she is driving down the road, the camera zooms in very close to her face, making it awkward for the audience and the screen seems to get tighter and tighter and with the terrifying music playing it has you on the edge of your seat. Not all of the techniques that Hitchcock uses are technical; a lot of what makes this such a great movie is all the twists in the storyline. When Marion arrives at the hotel she is staying at there is a huge mansion in the background that appears to be very spooky. The camera shoots up at it making the viewer feel very small and intimidated. The shadows that are seen behind the curtains were a great effect and added to the spookiness of the movie. I thought that the music was one of the best techniques. A movie isn't scary unless it has the right music. I'm sure the audience could tell that he must have been a perfectionist; there was so much effort put in to this movie beyond what most would expect.

There is so much to discuss about this movie, especially the end, but I don't want to give it away. I would rate Psycho 10/10. It was truly a classic in it's time as well as it is today.",
20 February 2004,The Master of Suspense?... yea he really is,"Psycho is a fantastic movie, mainly for those who love the details of movies. The director, Alfred Hitchcock, was the first that did what people would call a `horror movie.' Using camera angles, music, and voices in a person's head, he creates a truly suspenseful movie.

First, he creates suspense by having voices in the character's head. These are the voices of people that the character knows. They generally are saying things that may be going on while the character is not there.

Then he adds some camera angles. During a time when the main character is scared Hitchcock will show the face, then quickly, move to something else. Then, when he returns to the character, the shot it much closer to the character's face. After a few repeated times of doing this, the camera is uncomfortably close to the actor/actress' face.

Lastly, he adds the final touch; loud, clashing, orchestral music. Music in a film can really alter the viewer's mood. This music definitely adds to the suspense.

If I were to rate this movie on a scale of one to ten (ten being great), I would give this movie a 9.5. It is a fantastic movie that many people could enjoy.",9
5 April 2015,F#ck Psycho,"Hitchcock may be one of the greats, but that's no excuse for doing sub par work and making a half-good movie. You can't do that, man. What reasons do I have for assaulting a classic? It's 1 in the morning, I'm not wearing pants, I have insomnia as a result of depression, and I thought that Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece make-you-wet-your-adult- diaper thriller was a load of horse manure.

I first saw Psycho with my family one Halloween. I expected what the DVD case said: a thriller. What I got was not much in return. The story follows Marion Something who decides to rob her perfectly nice boss and go on the run with the money. Why? Doesn't matter. She is then pursued by a theorizing cop for a wholesome round of filler suspense. I wasn't embroiled in her life. I was bored. She then stops at a motel and after a long bout of small talk with the creepy care-taker, is murdered. I haven't marked this as a spoiler because it isn't one. It barely happens halfway through.

I don't give a flying, enchanted sh!t about shocking the audience if it removes the stupid main character from the stupid movie. The rest of the movie is a detective (about whom I saw no reason to care) looking into Marion's disappearance and ultimately the wacky misadventures of Marion's sister and Marion's butt buddy Sam. THIS WEBSITE lists Marion as fourth in the cast and I'm expected to pay attention. I found myself disengaged from the story. I blame the screenplay. Upon closer inspection and after a second, forced viewing in film class, I saw that there was still three-act structure and an antagonist. There's even the first conflict between the protagonist and primary opposition at the middle as Dan Decker states in Anatomy of a Screenplay. I was still not interested and a movie can be uninteresting if it follows some of the rules. Ask yourself this: how much is actually known about Marion, Lila, or Sam?

Psycho was expertly directed, shot, and edited. The shower scene lived up to its expectations. The ending was creepy and plot-twisty enough for me. But for all that, I still found that I didn't care. I hated this movie and the positive qualities didn't come up past the area that failed and is most important to me: story.",6
21 January 2006,Psycho (5/5 stars),"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

29 June 2005,Whats all the fuss about,"Whats the fuss about the movie anyways? I guess in it's it may have been a hit but when i saw it last year (2004) I was not impressed. The much talked about scary shower scene didn't even mildly startle me. Its a good movie but not sure why its considered a ""timeless classic"".

My Dad was full of praise before we even started watching it. There was this last scene where it was meant to be ""all revealed"". I kind of guessed that Norman's mom was dead earlier and again it wasn't scary. I don't find skeletons and corpses on screen scary but then maybe its me coz I never am scared at the movies.

The movie is basically good. Well directed, well acted and for its time it must have been technically sound too. But a classic? This seems a case of nostalgia and faddishness taking over in judging a movie than the movie itself. People seem to be rating ti based on what it meant to them than on if they like watching it NOW. If i have to see an old movie I would choose Streetcar Named Desire .",5

19 February 2004,"Combination technique, directing, and acting make psycho worth the scary parts.","Alfred Hitchcock shows massive skill in the overall display of his film, Psycho. Using almost all new views and carefully plotted signs, the ""Master of Suspense"" was one of the first to use dark plots to entice his audiences. Psycho is what would now be considered a lot less than terrifying; with thousands of movies out frightening viewers, a movie from the 1960's wouldn't seem like such a big deal. Psycho is the number one prototype of scary movies, the movies seen today use ideas and camera angles that Alfred Hitchcock mastered. The design of the movie is to make the audience uncomfortable; and by using intense orchestral music and close-ups on the emotion of the characters the director accomplishes that goal. The plot starts out simple and assumingly bland, and what is amazing is that Alfred Hitchcock used such a simple story that could be told in minutes and reformed it into one of the best thrillers of all time. Combined with the acting Psycho is crucial to the movie industry itself, the characters themselves are outlined wonderfully and add a sense of anxiousness essential to the script.

The movie takes more than one watching, but should be seen by a diverse group of people. It is a good movie and can therefore be enjoyed by an indifferent audience, while serious moviegoers could also enjoy its subtle hints and background scenes. From young ages to old, the value of the movie stays mainly constant; it really depends on the opinion of the viewer for that particular genre. What makes Psycho unique is that even the most frightened person can see the worth of it, if that person gets up enough courage to stick with it.",8
13 August 2012,Rarely any horror film in my opinion as ever toped this,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized.

23 December 2012,Maybe the Greatest of all Horror Films.,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was a revolutionary in the horror genre when it shocked audiences back in 1960. Watching it again on blu-ray I can say confidently it has held up extremely well. It stars Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin, all in strong performance, especially Perkins whose creepy yet vulnerable Norman Bates led to him being typecast as that character for the rest of his life. But without the touch of the master Hitchcock it would have been nothing more than a very decent thriller. The atmosphere is amazing, tension builds perfectly, and even if you know the outcome the shocking turns will leave those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing it with their hearts racing.

Marion Crane has stolen some money, a lot of money, in the irrational hope she can use it to help her boyfriend. After arousing the suspicion of a cop and a car dealer she arrives at the Bates Motel where she meets the odd but seemingly kind owner, Norman Bates. The rest, well spoiling anything else is either unforgivable because it's so huge or pointless because so many people, even without having seen it, know the major twist going in. I knew the shocker before I first saw the movie, but if it dampened the experience it didn't do it by much. Every scene has a purpose (yes even that ending that some think was unnecessary), every character is meaningful and many shots are unforgettable. This one of Hitchcock's best and arguably the greatest horror film ever made.",10
20 February 2004,Don't believe the hype.,"Psycho

Lets assume for just one minute that Alfred Hitchcock's movie Psycho is not an American classic and that, hypothetically, it was so boring it could put an insomniac to sleep. Would I have a lynching mob outside of my door with burning torches in hand? Well, I think that I'll take that chance with this review and challenge the opinion of many before me.

The movie Psycho was hyped as a masterpiece, an American classic from the mind of the `Master of Suspense' Alfred Hitchcock. But to me Alfred Hitchcock was the master of losing my attention. The movie starts out slow, painfully slow. The acting was fine, it was nothing Oscar worthy, but it did the trick. Nothing in the story stands out in the first forty-five minutes or so which I think was meant to build suspense. The first part of a story is the crucial time to grab the audience's attention so that it can hold it for the rest of the tale, any attempt to grab their focus later is too late. The dialogue and action is very low energy and uninteresting, it was nothing worth wasting your time watching.

To be fair, the frame of mind before you watch the 1960's movie Psycho is important. One must realize that at the time of the movie's release, the public hadn't been desensitized by excessive violence in the media yet, and that the standard for what was suspenseful was very different then. But this movie is dull in any decade.

There was something interesting about the character Norman Bates. Something about his funny little quirks and his dark and tangled depth that was hypnotizing to watch. Whenever his character appeared, my eyes were drawn to the screen. And the plot twists involving Norman were commendable at the least,

But one character is not able to keep an entire movie afloat. And you can't give a movie a title of `classic' just because it totes clever writing. I'm not naive to think that just because I don't like Psycho doesn't make bad, but I soul searched very hard and still couldn't see what all the hype was about. To me, a classic is something that transcends time and is entertaining and good no matter what year it is. Psycho just doesn't measure up to classic' status.",
3 September 2017,Remarkable,"After 57 Years This Movie Makes You Fear , I Mean Real fear , Not Like Exorcist , Exorcist Is Not Horror , But Psycho Is, When you seen This Movie Specially The Final Scene You Shocked , In 2017 No Movie Can Or Knowing Anything About Horror Or Shocking But Alfred Hitchcock Makes That Long Time Ago . Make Real Horror Movie That We Don,t See Anymore, But I Think The Last Good One Was The Descent . This Two Film Is Always Stay In Best Horror Of All Time And In My Opinion Psycho Is Best Of Hitchcock.

18 December 2011,Hitch's Best,"this top box office of 1960 is my most favorite flick among Hitchcock's. ""Psycho"" (which is considered as the most Notorious movie from the master of suspense) has influenced a LOT of directors ( Brian De Palma at the most & even Gus Van Sant who became obsessed & did the greatest mistake of his career to remake it frame by frame!).

I barely know any more famous classic sequence than the bathing scene in ""Psycho"" n let's do not ever forget the role of Bernard Hermann & his extra-ordinary score in immortalizing this movie.

I recently read an interview with Roman Polanski & once he said:(concept) "" ... most of Hitchcock's became old-fashioned n out of date for me during the time but i still love ""Psycho"", cos' i like to horrify the viewers in the dark theaters"".

that's the fact that ""Psycho"" still does after near 50 years.",10

17 August 2006,film isn't as good as the novel,"When I read the novel, it really creeped me out. Not long after I watched the film and was disappointed. The only thing I liked in it were the story (which is absolutely the same as in the book), b/w cinematography and acting from Anthony Perkins. Shower scene and the scene when Bates runs in his mother's outfit were hilarious. What makes the film good is its story. Thanks to Robert Bloch, not Alfred Hitchcock! And come on, Hitchcock is overrated. Most of his films are very theatrical and acting in them is not credible. Billy Wilder and Orson Welles are much better directors, in my opinion. Sorry for my English. I'm from Russia.

19 August 2002,The Definitive Horror Film (May Contain Spoilers),"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
30 April 2010,"Arguably, Hitchcock's best","It's very hard to talk about this movie without any spoilers, because when I want to review a good movie, I want to bring the best out of it, and to do so with this masterpiece, I would have to mention certain scenes or cases that involve spoilers.

But...

I'll try my best. Psycho is best described as an excellent flick that contains strong and effective scenes with good acting, powerful suspenseful moments and a brilliant plot! And when I say brilliant plot...I mean BRILLIANT!

Psycho is shot in black and white, gray-scale/monochrome gray color, but that only makes it more distinguished and interesting as an independent movie from the 60's

A young woman, named Marion Crane, decides to steal 40.000$ from her employer's client when she gets the chance. She then escapes with the money and is determined to start a new life with her lover, Sam Loomis, in California where she believes they can live happily together. On the way, she comes across with bad weather and a heavy rain. After driving a while, she decides to stop at the nearest motel by...The rather isolated, Bates Motel. A week passes by and one day, Marion's Sister, Lila, arrives at Sam's store only to inform him of her sister's disappearance!

Alfred Hitchcock did a great job as a director in this movie. I especially felt that the opening scene was shot amazingly well from a wide angle which then, dives into the house. And not to mention...the legendary shower sequence! Brilliant directing :)

The cast is good. Janet Leigh has her moments as Marion. Vera Miles, who played her sister, also did a great job. Martin Balsam was outstanding as detective Milton Arbogast and John Gavin did his job of portraying the heroic Sam Loomis... But the one who I think stole every scene completely and made it into his own, was Anthony Perkins, I mean..that guy was, without any doubts, way ahead of his time! It's stunning to watch him transform into, and become, Norman Bates. His manners and stuttering... he definitely at least deserved an Oscar nomination in my opinion (and probably many others).

About the spoilers...Let's just say that this movie has a great conclusive ending and delivers the plot and twist in the best way possible.

I thought this movie was extremely good and think that people ought to watch it and forget about modern-day special effects or brainless gore that people have gotten so used to. Just sit down, relax, have yourself some popcorn and prepare to get blown off by an amazing and down-right suspense, nerve-thrilling movie...prepare yourself for...PSYCHO!",10
20 February 2004,Showering is for suckers,"Classic as well as classy, Psycho brought more to the table than your average wannabe slasher movie.

This film had all the right elements: a good solid plot/storyline filled with scandal, deceit, horror and MURDER which was all backed up with excellent camera work, cinematography, and good old fashioned directing from the one and only, Alfred Hitchcock.

Being a Hitchcock creation, there is much to be expected from the flick and needless to say, the man delivered to the fullest. Well-choreographed camera movements strongly portrayed the emotion of each character within the shots and captured the audience's attention right from the get-go. Every shot had life and individuality. Creative camera angles and close-ups illustrated the characters' movements/interactions with Swiss precision. The shadows that were used in the murder scenes were a nice touch. This gave away the premonition that obviously, something bad was about to happen, but was still very intimidating and spooky and worked well with the classic black and white tinge the film was presented in.

The film's soundtrack did more than just add suspense. The music made the scene a lot more believable and provided a brilliant hook for the viewer to latch onto. The gut-wrenching stroke of each string given by Herrmann's mini orchestra brought out the obvious emotions in every scene it accompanied whether it was worry, fear, despair, etc.

The inner monologues were another nice touch. If the shots and the soundtrack weren't enough for the audience, Norman and Marion's inner monologues filled in the blanks. They both showed not only their thoughts, but also, their persona. It allowed the audience to tap into their minds and really see what was going on inside of them.

Of course you can't talk about Psycho, without talking about the legendary shower scene. Honestly, this reviewer got more than a few hearty laughs in when watching this `horrific' display of violence. The scene was obviously needed, but could've been a lot more believable. The sound effects were okay, but the actual knife slashing and the body contact weredare I sayCHEAP! This reviewer is fully aware that it was the 1960's, but come on! Hitchcock was a cinematic genius! He could've made the scene a little less comical and a lot more horrifying. But hey, it was good, almost as good as the ending. Now this reviewer doesn't like to reveal secrets, but would like to say that the ending may not have the same effect to a modern-day audience as it did to a 1960's audience, because inconceivable endings like this one have been duplicated and butchered by following directors over the past 40 years. Just try to keep in mind that this film is an original masterpiece and maybe, you'll see a hint of Hitchock's creativity and brilliance.

All in all, it was an superb film. This psychological thriller undoubtedly deserves the prestige and positive reviews it has received from countless critics. It has set the standard for what a good cinematic thriller should be. Psycho is for anyone who loves a good mystery and/or overall excellent film. Do not let the black and white discourage you, instead, embrace it and welcome it. You'll learn to appreciate it with this film. Weathering years of positive and negative criticism it is obvious that this is the work of a genius and has every right to be called, one of the greatest films of all time. STOP READING AND GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!",
19 February 2004,A brilliant PSYCHO-logical thriller...,"Alfred Hitchcock was either insane or genius. Or maybe it was the combination of the two that made Hitchcock such an amazing director. He opened so many doors for future horror films and for future directors in general. Hitchcock wasn't an immediate hit though, even though he made over 50 films in his amazing career that spanned 5 decades. There was much debate over the violence in Psycho. But Hitchcock did become very famous, and his work was and is still very much admired. Psycho is brilliant. Plain and simple, it is a movie that could not have been made, written or directed any better. In 1998, Gus Van Sant did attempt to re-create this classic. And even though it was done shot-by-shot, it flopped at the box offices and definitely vexed many hard-core original Psycho fans. The original is without a doubt a timeless thriller, it was perfectly made. There are so many reasons why Psycho is ranked so high in movie lovers' hearts, but the psychological aspect of it has to be one of the biggest. Again, the psychological aspects of this film are astounding. It's one of those thrillers where in the end, one can only think `whoa'. Hitchcock had this amazing way of involving the viewer in his films. He makes the viewer hang on the edge of their seat throughout the whole movie. And it's not the sort of suspense that we're used to. It's different. He used music and camera angles and little hints along the way to add to the suspense. There are only a handful of these kinds of films, and Hitchcock can for sure be credited for those, maybe not for making them, but making those directors and writers able to show their creativity in this new form of horror movies.

This film definitely deserves 12 out of 10. It exceeds viewers expectations and leaves them still thinking.",
27 February 2019,An overrated classic,"This is a classic and has been an inspiration for many psychological crime movies after. No argue in that. Perkin does it really well. Music is well-composed but that an especially the plot is good for that era. I watched this and 45min passed, the ending was clear. I watched the thriller after the film was done. Don't watch it before!! An absolute overrated predictable thriller. That is it. Thriller. Not horror! At least not the best horror in IMDb! I would give this 6.5/10 I don't usually watch black and white, but there was so many praise around this one. I don't know but I think the new +8/10 ratings are somehow compelled to do so by seeing this on the Top 50.

23 April 2013,Hitchcock's Best,"I envy anybody who is watching this for the first time; 'Psycho' is a tremendous staple of directing performances, horror movies and cinema in general. Alfred Hitchcock's quality in ability makes itself known with the famous 'eye shot' of Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) and the most perfect examples of suspense in films.

But the greatness doesn't end there, the eerie and gloomy exterior shots equal to notable cinematography, Norman Bates' (played by Anthony Perkins) sense of growing insanity and subtle desperation equals to one fine acting performance, and the well-acted dialogue scenes equal to the growth of plot suspense and magnificent character development. As mentioned, Anthony Perkins delivers a great display as motel owner Norman Bates, a great display of acting that keeps the audience in deep suspense. What's more prolific is the iconic 'shower scene', which makes use of the excellent orchestral string stabs along withwell, actual stabs.

One of the greatest and most influential stories in the history of fiction, along with insanely eerie outcomes, 'Psycho' really is a must- see for any movie fan.",9
3 August 2020,8.5 Hitchcock's best.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially.

2 April 2011,One of the best most scary movies ever...,"This movie is truly scary in a way modern horror movies aren't. There is almost no blood and absolutely no gore in it which modern horror movies are full of. The scary parts of the film is you can never see any gore so its all up to your imagination. And the acting is the best i've ever seen Anthony Perkins plays Norman bates so well i truly believed he was psycho and Janet Leigh even though she wasn't their the entire movie while she was their she owned the screen. The music was terrifying to say the least and was perfect for the movie. What else to say besides if you haven't seen it go get it NOW but make sure you take a shower before you watch it

28 January 2006,Essential thrills for everyone,"A young woman defrauds her boss and attempts to get away with the money. On her way to escape, she stops at a deserted motel owned by an introvert Norman Bates (Perkins), and quite unexpectedly gets killed from the hands of Norman's mother. A young couple, with the helping hand of a private eye, follow the tracks of the missing woman down to the motel. And soon the murder unfolds the mystery behind the perpetrator's mind.

Psycho is a masterpiece of a thrilling, typically Hitch meta-genre cinema. Counting the number of references in other movies, you can easily call it a cult classic, which should be dug in the ground inside a time-capsule. The famous shower scene is just one thing why you simply must see this one, although labeling this movie as 'horror' is a bit misleading. Yet, some people consider it a proto-slasher movie, take notice everyone. And after those 45 years it is still a great watch for newbies. Recommended to all the Martians who have fallen on Earth and have no clue about the cinema.

23 January 2018,PSYCHOlogical terror at its best!,"Psycho is a slasher/thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. This film follows a young Phoenix secretary named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). She embezzled forty thousand dollars from her employer so she can get away with her secret lover. During this, she tries to avoid a police officer that is suspicious of her by taking back roads and stops at the Bates Motel. She meets the owner of the motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). At first, he seems like a polite man, but as the film moves on she becomes unsure of him and his intentions.

My nitpick with this film comes from the beginning of this film. In the beginning of this film, Alfred Hitchcock does a great job of establishing the character, as he always does. The beginning of this film uses the setting, her job, the things around her, and all the smallest details of her character to do so. This makes her stealing the forty thousand dollars feel like a very believable move for the character. Hitchcock continues to do this and it pays off as the character sees great development throughout the first half of the film. Although, as this happens, this film is simply without an identity and even when Norman Bates arrives on the scene, you can't help but wonder what kind of film your watching.

This is quickly shoved aside when you learn what kind of character Norman Bates is and what his intentions are. From here on the film feels perfect. Bernard Herrmann gives a chilling score that becomes even more effective in the second half of the film when it compliments intense murder scenes and Anthony Perkins terrifying performance. Anthony Perkins simply gives one of the best performances ever. He gives a truly disturbing one that still keeps the viewer wanting more. Anthony Perkins takes over this film by himself.

The second half of this film moves smoothly and is very unpredictable. This film boasts great character development, an unexpected and fulfilling plot, and one of the greatest performances ever seen on film. This film has one or two negatives that are only nitpicking and doesn't take away from the film. For me, this is a near perfect film, but this is mostly due to Anthony Perkins performance. My score: 9.5/10",9
1 July 2015,An American Classic!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
2 August 2016,Best horror movie!,"Alfred Hitchcock's movies are so scary, even this one! I have never seen so scary as this is. How Gus Van Sant can do another film from this movie what's the same as this?! Doesn't he have any idea what movie he's directing? Well I can say, no one can not make any good rip-off from this movie! I loved it and still do. This movie really is one of the best movies of all time! If any of you haven't seen it, well I say that you better watch it before it's too late. This movie lives forever and give some chills of horror. I'm really big horror fan and I think this movie should win Oscar! Not just be nominated for Oscar. If you hate the movie, you should watch it again and come back. When you have seen it again, you can think as I do now. Go on watch it now!!

4 January 2005,What a SUPERB psychological thriller!,"Psycho is the BEST psychological-horror thriller I have ever seen. All suspense movies made ever since don't compare at all to this fantastic film. I have seen all but 3 of Hitchcock's movies, and this one is the BEST he ever made. If you love suspense, I highly recommend you watch this film. Buy it! ALfred Hitchcock turns a seemingly grim story into a masterpiece of a film. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles some money. She goes to meet her boyfriend whom she wishes to marry, and on the way decides to stay at the Bates Motel. If you want to find out what happens next, you'll just have to watch the movie. :) I promise you, it is a movie you won't soon forget. WARNING Psycho is not a movie to be seen by anyone under 13, due to it's violent content. Still, it is a fascinating movie to be enjoyed by more MATURE audiences. I love Psycho! I give this movie a 10+. Oh, by the way, you might have heard about the shower scene, but you just have to watch it to see how good it really is. It's true- you might not want to take a shower for a while after watching this movie. I didn't.

At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

21 April 2006,The Best Film of all time,"Quite simply the best film of all time. Tony Perkins gives one of the best performances from a male actor on screen. Sensational story, superbly directed by Hitchcock and excellent performances from all actors especially Janet Leigh. An amazing film for 1960, the story is the best horror of all time, the lonely hotel, the eerie house and the quiet mysterious deranged proprietor make the atmosphere sensational. Would have been very enjoyable to have seen this movie when it was first released as the story was unknown and to have the beautiful main character (Janet Leigh) killed so early and in the most vicious way in the shower was such an unexpected and shocking turn! The scene is one of the most famous in movie history but was not done by Tony as he was very squeamish and shy around woman! What began as a young woman running away with some money to better her and her boyfriends future turns into the murdering, deranged world of Norman Bates. You never know that Norman is the killer until the end, nor do you know he is mentally ill, but of course you always have this feeling! The film especially for its time is just so different, so wonderfully done and the story is made from amazing imagination. The film is much better than the book as the character in the book is not similar to Tony Perkins Norman. This was Perkins role of a life time and he does it amazingly, he was born to play this part and will always be here with us as Norman as the film will always be in the memory as it is the best film ever made.It has also influenced every horror movie since and continues to be influential to this day. RIP Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh and thanks for the movies,the performances and the entertainments you gave us.",10
17 April 2019,Game Changing Movie,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

1 November 2002,Watch and learn.,"Ever wonder about people? The quiet ones? Wonder why their so bashful and reluctant to go out? Maybe their hiding something. It would be wise not to disturb them, but, you never know. Psycho to me was just another story of a lonely deeply troubled boy hiding from the past. Do you have something your hiding? Is it bad? Is it making you live like a hermit? Watch Norman Bates and wonder if you have it as bad as he does.

11 April 2002,The best horror film ever,"This great horror film is not even out dated today. It's the best. Every Part of it is great.

This one is definitely reccomended. It's scary and suspenseful. The acting is superb. Alfred Hitchcock directs beautifully.

If you're in the mood for a good horror film, this is definitely reccomended. 5 stars out of 5

27 October 2014,Unexpectedly dull movie for the modern times,"Granted, this movie might be of a lot of artistic value, with all the cinematography amongst other things, and also it might have scared a lot of people in the older generations. But I don't see any reason why this movie should be rated 1st amongst the Horror movie genre top 10 in contemporary times. Imagine an average Joe who wants to spend his precious weekend day watching a good horror flick with his girlfriend to get to cosying up. He would expect the no. 1 in horror genres on IMDb to be pretty scary to say the least.

Not only did this movie failed to ""horrify"" the both of us, we did not find this much of an entertaining thriller as well(as it is just that--a thriller). Not sure why it's listed in the horror category. Do not recommend this movie if your situation is similar to what I described above. Maybe if you're a movie enthusiast who loves the cinematographic detail, go ahead...

23 October 2004,Another Hitchcock Favorite,"I first saw this movie when I was a young girl and had never seen anything like it. I had never seen a woman in a bra, in the movies, and had never seen anyone flush a toilet. Also, it was always a man who stole the money. Never a young pretty woman. One of the best scenes in the movie, I believe, is when Norman and Marion are in the parlor. Anthony Perkins was so convincing as a disturbed young man. He was trying to defend his mother for her ""illness""and saying at the time,how much he hated the prison she had put him in. The fact that I lived down the street from a taxidermist might have added to my fear. I also did not have a clue as to the state of his mother. That came as a real shock. This must have been the first horror movie. It is also true that a lot of my friends took only baths after seeing that movie. Never a shower. Janet Leigh's eyeball and the drain was clever. I suppose it pales in comparison to todays slasher movies, but for it's time, it was a terrifying day at the movies. When you view this movie, remember the time in which it was made.

25 July 2014,Knowing the Twist Doesn't Ruin the Movie,"The rule of thumb for any movie, good or bad, is to never give away the ending, especially if there is a twist at the end, and Psycho has the biggest twist ending in any movie. But the reason why this movie is so great is that, by the way it's shot, paced, acted and filmed, the twist still shocks you, even when you know it. That's the magic of Hitchcock's directing, that his movies can't be spoiled because all the scenes work together perfectly. The shower scene is one of the most parodied and copy scenes in movie history, and yet watching this movie, and experiencing everything that happened before it, the scene is able to shock you. I won't give away the ending, but if you do know the ending, don't think the movie has been spoiled for you, in my opinion, this movie is impossible to spoil.

17 March 2018,One of the Wonders of the Cinema,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
26 April 2002,Way Overated,"Compared to many of Hitchcock's other works, this movie is a bust. Although it may have been extremely scary at the time, today it is laughably bad. The story sucks and the acting isn't great. The one thing I do give Hitchcock credit for doing well is the famous shower scene. Without it the movie would have never even been heard of.

8 October 2003,Greatly overestimated,"This film is very overestimated just as so many other film-classics. It's certainly not a bad film but it's not worth the high ranking. Maybe Hitchcock was a pioneer in his genre and important for future horror-film-directors. But this is not a reason to still love the film. Also worth mentioning is the acting (not realistic) and the technical aspects (the photography isn't that good) which for their time of course wasn't that bad, but compared to, for ex. ""The Shining"" (#87 in the IMDB top 250) is lousy. In the end the film isn't that scary. I recommend ""Dark Water"" (or ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"") by Hideo Nakata if you want something scary. Maybe Hitchcock WAS a genius, but his films are outdated like Jesse Owens world-records.

10 August 2007,Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho',"'Psycho' is Alfred Hitchcock's strangest, most disturbing, and best film he has ever made. The movie starts off in Phoenix, Arizona where lovers Sam Loomis and Marion Crane are sharing a secret, passionate afternoon in a cheap hotel. Marion is worried that their relationship won't work because they live so far apart and have to keep their love a secret. In the next scene, Marion is at work, her boss asks her to deliver 40, 000 dollars into the bank. In desperation, she steals the money and pursues California to find her lover and run away with him with their new fortune. On the way, however, Marion goes through several obstacles. A policemen finds her suspicious, as does a car salesman. Marion is a clumsy thief. Finding it hard to see the road through a rainstorm, Marion pulls off into an old inn, The Bates Motel. There she meets Norman Bates, a flirtatious, sad, likable guy who's aggressive mother worries Marion. Here are two people, Marion and Norman, who are both trapped. However, Marion has a chance to redeem herself, and she hopes Norman does too. The choice to film in black and white was an inspiration. Instead of grossing out the audience, Hitchcock disturbs the audience with violent and tragic scenes. Joseph Stefano hands over a brilliant script, making this story extremely interesting from a source material that was rather quite dull. We never know exactly where the storie's going and the melding powers of Hitchcock and Stefano are to thank. The music by Bernard Hermann is pure genius. From the second the film opens, our attention is on the screen. The score is all strings, and it brings out the beauty of the black and white picture. Janet Leigh gives a terrific performance as Marion Crane, as do Gavin Lee, Martan Balsam and Vera Miles as the supporting characters. But the best performances come from a voice over work by Virginia Gregg as 'Mother' and Anthony Perkins' defining role as Norman Bates, not only the best performance in his career, but the best performance given by any actor ever. He captures all the subtleties and tragic struggle of the character so well, that he is one of the most memorable characters of all time. Psycho has a terrific surprise ending and a everything ties up nicely in a psychiatric scene most critics seem to hate, but I find resonate. The film has two reaccuring themes: Dependence and hatred of our own mothers. And describing a word by using the same word: ""Eating in an office is too officious."" ""You make respectability sound disrespectful."" ""I will not speak of such disgusting things because they disgust me."" All in all, Psycho is a near perfect film, and a film that hopefully will live forever.",10
14 May 2005,The movie sucks,"The movie starts off with a woman stealing some money and landing up to a deserted motel (I know it sounds like a cheap horror movie) and the rest of the movie is about what happens to her next. I'm sure when people from 60's first watched it they were terrified due to the newer type of suspense and terror but today if anyone watches it he would be able to predict everything except may be the climax.This movie is not for our time (Only movies like ring could perhaps scare now), this movies time has PASSED. Now, PSYCHO is only for people from that era or the people from movie-making business.It has got few thrills but it is nothing compared to horror/thriller movies made these days.It surely did sound great in 1960's but now if anyone tries to see it for the first time as I did then I assure you, you will be regretting why you even rented or bought it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone neither the thriller addict nor a normal person.It isn't simply worth your time and money.

4/10 (3 points just for it's climax)",8

18 February 2019,Axel's Review,"This movie is great to watch with friends and family. One of the thing that I really liked about the movie was that it was shoot in black and white. Another thing that stude out was that the music was changing the mood of the characters. Almost every time the people don't notice the way a character changes how they walk,talk or even act because the director wants that to happen. I'll tell you why he need our attention some where else instead of the main point. That's what Alfred Hitshcok did with this movie. That's why this is a master pice that will go on to generations. Honestly the movie will be way better if they didn't show the person who was crazy. That would of being a good turning point where the director could of had the option of continuing the movie or let the people with the urge of watching another part of the story. But I truly recommended to the people who like the old classic movies.

29 July 2020,Well made,"Very few times does a movie perfectly encapsulate the source material...and this didn't either. I've given a 10 star review as it is an amazing film, and yet the book is still better; and i know...how can you get better than 10/10? Read it and see. But this is a beautifully shot movie!

3 December 2014,"Promises to much, boring content but good actors","I do not get why this movie is so popular. I wouldn't watch it again either not only because the movie is black and white, but also the story is simple, but crazy. It do not get into time nowadays. But still the actors were good. I knew this movie from my parents but I expected also a bit more than the movie showed. What I actually like is that the movie is about real happenings, so that it interesting on the other side. It wasn't very exciting. The audio is cruel from todays view, but great for older times. The story was not awaited and simple. So for me it is a movie which was good in times before I lived, but I would rather watch horror movies that are in cinemas today.

Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
20 April 2002,GENIUS GENIUS GENIUS!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

9 April 2003,The best film ever in my opinion,"The truth of the matter is, everytime I think about great films, Psycho is the first to enter my mind. Ever since I saw it for the first time in 1989 on television I have not been able to let go. The simplicity of the imagery, and the fine-skilled actors, make it into a masterpiece. Hitchcock went on to make many great movies more, but ""Pscyho"" is the portrayal of a very disturbed man and his mental state is shown simple, matter-of-factly like only Hitch could do it. I´ve seen it 10 times now, and I will continue to, because it´s the best film I have ever seen. And now,if you will excuse me, Mother is kind of hungry.....

5 October 2016,Ahead Of Its Time,"This movie is one of the best movies of Alfred Hitchcock. Definitely it is a milestone in horror-thriller movies. Ahead of its time because, when you look at the horror movies that made in 60's, you will mostly see zombies, vampires, monsters or somethings like that. But this movie achieve to tense and frighten audience without any of these and give a new impulse to movie sector. Absolutely, step forward with its distinctive subject according to its time. This movie has watched someone itself from beginning to the end without get bored. This is a great movie and Alfred Hitchcock did a very good job. Please remember that this movie made in 1960 when watching.

27 August 2008,Best horror movie ever... and it truly stands the test of time,"The absolutely exquisite use of lighting, direction and musical score drive you to the point where it is almost unbearable to look at the screen. You feel so uneasy and sick to your stomach, because your mind is pushed to the point where you just can't take it anymore. The eyes, the fly, the piercing music...

All the money, gore and cheesy special effects used in today's 'horror movies' (it's been a while since I have actually seen a modern film worthy of being called a horror movie) will never be able to hold a candle to this classic. It works because it's simple and plausible. That feeling in your gut when you see a flicker of something unsettling in someone's eyes, but you ignore it. That sound in the night that you convince yourself you didn't hear. That movement in the shadows that you couldn't possibly have seen...right up until it's too late for you put all those pieces together. What could be more horrifying than that? The last time I saw this film was 15 years ago. I watched it last night and still couldn't get to sleep.",10

27 October 2013,it will catch you off guard,"It will catch you off guard and shock you by the end. It seems so stimulating at the start but as the movie develops you wonder ""why am I watching this?"". It confuses you as to what the hell is going on. Awkward moments and bothersome ambient noise will blur your attention. But if you're open minded and curios enough it will set the viewer for what is really to come.

what is brilliant about this is that i think it does that on purpose; to get you nonchalant. It seems like you know what is going on but it springs you off later on.

Though the plot is at praise, the acting is really mediocre and the visual and sound effects may seem unsatisfying. But it was the 60's (you could say late 50's) so what could you expect? And it's kind of ludicrous to try and compare it to modern films but it's hard to refrain from that. the shower scene is really iconic as well as the intense music used.",9

9 May 2014,Review of the Movie Psycho,"The movie Psycho is a very thrilling and amazingly filmed movie. This was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies.The screenplay was great and the writing was wonderful.The way the movie switches from calm to kill works well and I like the use your imagination rather than the gore. the shower scene though great would have been pointless without the dramatic scary music.Watching this movie over and over, it still doesn't get boring to me at all. His style of filming leaves so much beauty to look at before the horror begins here. i Be-leave that everyone should watch this movie just to see how tremendously wonderful of a movie it is.

4 July 2021,I'll explain myself,"This movie people consider as a masterpiece and I am not saying otherwise but time makes things crumble. The story is still good of course, that is the one thing that can defy time, but some other aspects are corroded. I don't wan't to leave spoilers and I think if you watch the movie you will understand what I mean, but this movie is worth a watch. What I like the most is that it is dynamic, meaning that the story is always progressing, no big dialogues, no boring stuff. There is romance in the movie, but just enough so that the story has a meaning. Acting is not realistic but theatrical, which is expected from movies from that period. This movie offers a lot of fun even though it is not as scary as it once was. Try and you won't regret it.

27 February 2021,A Classic?,"I've been watching a lot of critically acclaimed films lately and this is the first to let me down. I didn't find Psycho to be the least bit scary and I saw the 'twist' coming from a mile away.

The only positives I take from the film is Anthony Perkins did a very good job as Norman Bates and the music in the film was quite good. I understand it may have been scary for the time of release and that audiences back then may not have been accustomed to a plot twist but this is a 'classic film' that unfortunately does not hold up today.

He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
31 May 2010,THE Most Influential Movie of All Time,"I challenge you to think of a more influential movie than Alfred Hitchcock's psycho. Such a movie does not exist.

Psycho created its own genre: Sure, there were monster, killer, and ""horror"" movies prior to 1960, but Psycho is the first actually good one. All pre-Psycho films are merely proto-horror movies. People still watch Psycho and, importantly, they still watch it as a horror movie. When people watch Frankenstein or Dracula, they are watching it for A) a laugh, or B) because it's famous. While Dracula and Frankenstein might sell in cheap monster movie box sets, Psycho still sells as a movie on its own, and to a wide and diverse audience that includes kids, adults, cinema lovers, and nacho lovers. No need to mention that every horror movie since Psycho is inspired by Psycho. This brings us to the next point...






One last thing. Critics everywhere regard Psycho as a masterpiece, but often include a little clause about the psychiatrist scene and how it's out of place. I'll admit that when I first watched the movie, I was petrified when the psychiatrist started his speech because I, too, thought that this would be the undoing of a would-be masterpiece. However, my fears were not realized. Every time I've watched the movie since, I actually enjoy this scene and I don't feel the need to justify it by saying, ""Oh, people back then needed this kind of scene to make sense of the movie and it's just dated now."" No, I can 100% truthfully say that I think the scene adds to the movie, and I consider myself brutally honest when it comes to Hitchcock movies, even though I am a fan. I feel that Vertigo, Shadow of a Doubt, and Notorious are all overrated and have problems, but not Psycho.",10
16 January 2014,The Birth of the Slasher Genre,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

30 March 2017,Brilliant,"This is the first horror-noir movie i watched and i think this movie is brilliant. This kind of plot is very rare in 60's era. This movie made me have goosebumps. The depiction of the old house and the motel's atmosphere made it more tense. Perfect acting of Anthony Parkins also makes audience more curious about the plot. I can call this is the best work of Alfred Hitchcock and arguably inspired the horror and thriller movies in the present.

19 March 2002,JUST WATCH IT,"If you've read about this movie on the back of the video case you've spoiled the most important element of the whole story. As the ""Master of Suspense"" himself said "" Don't tell anyone about it's shocking secret"" so I won't ( Ain't I cruel) and no one else should. Janet Leigh stars as Marion Crane a Phoenix office worker who turns in to a thief by stealing $40.000 cash from her employee and sets behind the wheil and heads for California. That's all you have to know, to know the rest of the story either read a spoil sport's review or watch the film as you should. Alfred Hitchcock has already proven decades before that he was in charge of the Hollywood camera with movies such as Rebecca, Rear Window, Vertigo and several other movies but with Psycho he proves that he is capable of extream high pulse. On a dark stormy night when your alone forget the crapy teenage movies sutch as Scream (unless you'r in to comedy) and Halloween this is the movie.

20 July 2002,Possibly my favorite Hitchcock movie,"I've seen ""Psycho"" about 10 times in the past, but I just recently watched it again for the first time in about two years. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the film was even better than I'd remembered. It may be my favorite film from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.

Given the fact that horror films have become increasingly macabre and disturbing over the years, ""Psycho"" does seem to have lost much of it's ability to frighten the viewer. Just imagine how this movie must have effected audiences in 1960. They'd never seen anything remotely close to this. I wish I could have been there.

Sadly, I'm a member of the younger generation, who has had the plot twists and famous moments spoiled for me. I can't appreciate the shower scene as much as most people because I probably saw dozens of rip-offs and spoofs of it before seeing the real thing. I was immune to being truly shocked by ""Psycho"", but it's an amazing experience, nonetheless.

Besides Hitchcock's ingenious direction, the key reason for the film's greatness is Anthony Perkins. He totally masters the psychotic Norman Bates with understated nervousness and desperation. Bates is the true main character of the film, and we can identify with him more than we can with any of the other characters.

I don't find ""Psycho"" to be terrifying; it's more thrilling and fun than scary. There are a few ominous moments to be found, though. My favorite is the final scene, with Bates in the asylum. It is genuinely uncomfortable to look at as the camera slowly zooms in closer to Bates' facial expressions, leaving the viewer in a state of claustrophobia. His final grin at the camera is truly spine tingling and unforgettable. It's one of the many images in ""Psycho"" that is imbedded in my mind.

There is only one set of scenes in the movie which I find to be a bit tedious, and that would be Norman's clean-up of the bathroom. Not that it isn't necessary, it just seems as if we see him doing more cleaning than we really need to. But this is a small fault in a nearly perfect film, which is as exciting and mesmerizing as it ever was. In other words, ""Psycho"" hasn't aged a day.",
20 July 2002,"Brilliant, Excellent, just plain AWESOME!","The film ""Psycho"" is not only one of my favorite movies of all time, but probably one of if not THE best horror film EVER. the first time i saw Psycho was with my dad on a Sunday morning because i was too scared to watch it at night, or alone. Even after my 100th time seeing it, i still find it just as suspenseful and intense.(Although my dad gave away the ending, and i will NOT do that here). The reason i love this movie so much is because the characters are believable. Anthony Perkins perfectly portrayed Norman Bates, and I really think that was the best performance by an actor in any movie I've seen! I think Anthony Perkins playing Norman was a mixed blessing because he was just SO GOOD in that movie, but he didn't really get offered to do anymore movies after Psycho,(which i thought was stupid because he was a brilliant actor). You actually find yourself sympathizing with Norman, which you really don't do with movies of its kind. Janet Leigh was great as Marion Crane, as well. Another thing: ALFRED HITCHCOCK. He is by far the greatest director of all time. All of his films were brilliant, and you always found yourself on the edge of your seat during the major climactic scenes. It's a shame he's dead now, because we really need more directors like Hitchcock, who can come up with such brilliant films as Psycho.",
1 August 2002,What i can say... Hitchcock`s best!,"I have seen this movie 3 times it is still scary. specially the shower. I loved Anthony Perkins. He is really sympathetic in Norman Bates-role, but his ""mother""... she scared hell out of me. So it is still creepy after all these years. Good job Hitchcock and Perkins.

18 March 2003,Hitchcock's most chilling....,"I was absolutely overwhelmed when I saw Psycho, I never thought an older movie would chill me to the bone, and it wasn't just the performances that intrigued me, Bernard Herrmann's classic score lives on with all his scores, I can watch this movie over and over again, and when chilling thrillers are concerned, Hitchcock proves that he is still the master of suspense, even after his death, and Herrmann's scores still terrify, even after his death as well.

2 June 2010,Quite simply the greatest horror ever made,"Firstly, I have a love/hate relationship with the horror genre. My previous encounters consisted of a few dozen snickers to my viewing partner about how the film was ridiculously unrealistic and could never happen, and that furthermore, it wasn't really scary because I knew what was coming. This leads to my main problem with the genre: I am an expert at discerning the plot climax well before it happens. This is a massive problem, because it takes away the suspense.

Just a heads up, I will not be spoiling anything here, I'll just describe the setting and characters. Nothing story orientated. Anyway, so imagine my surprise when I finally decided to jump into the last of the main four Hitchcock films: Psycho.

The film differentiates itself from Rear Window (1954) in more ways that one. Namely; its been filmed in black & white, the setting is purposely lower class and it focuses even more on the psychological rather than the physical. The villain might not have the razor sharp fingers of Freddy Kruger, or the deep seeded hatred of Jigsaw, but he/she is made infinitely more malevolent through the twists and turns conveyed by the director. What makes this villain so much scarier than all the rest? He or she's an inherently plausible evildoer; one who could be sitting right next to you while you watch the film for all you know. The horror of Hitchcock's masterpiece is that it forces you to question whether this could happen to you.

The filmography might not be as good as Vertigo (1958), but it's certainly up there, and easily the defining work of the genre. It seems somewhat like Sin City in it's technical codes, the director obviously had the capacity to use color, but he chose to use black & white, why is that I wonder? The lack of color (and the associated filmic codes) isn't a drawback, it's done to keep you ignorant of the horrors to come. In many ways 'Psycho' feels like a last tribute to the genre, but in reality it's simply a new beginning, like Clint Eastwood's 1993 epic 'Unforgiven' was for the Western genre.

Hitchcock makes you believe you ARE one of the protagonists. His use of lighting is fantastic: dark scenes preclude a twist, and every time he shows one you tremble in fear, and try to figure out what's going to happen. There's no point. The film is crafted so eloquently that the vast majority of people won't figure it out until well into it, at which point you're not annoyed that you've figured out the main plot element, but rather you become much more involved.

This is a masterpiece, and 'Psycho' is one of the few films that'll have you telling yourself that over and over again while you watch it.",10
17 April 2003,The World's Number One,"First time I watched Psycho when I was fifteen. For me it was a really true movie, because I have also a mother with some despotic states of mind, like Norman. Of course not so horrible, but I can emphathise with Norman very well. From that first watching Hitchcock has become my most favorite director, and I suppose he will always be.

Psycho was the complement of almost forty years of his movie-direction work and he took advantage of what he had learnt during the whole cinematographic time. From the silent season where the modern film tricks were not available, through the black-and-white film-noir epoch where metaphysics was essential, until the birth of technics in the time of wide-screen technicolor.

I can still listen to Bernard Herrmann's schizophrenic music against a background of the schizo-designed titles, as well as I can still see all the great scenes of the movie, even as I watched it more than twenty times.

Anthony Perkins interpreted the performance which is in my opinion the best I have ever seen. And I really know what is behavior, motion and gestures of a boy in a family with a despotic mother, as I mentioned.

Some people do not like Psycho because there are some horrible scenes. But they do not take account that the real artist cannot be fashionable. Psycho is one of those movies where the artistic beauty is in everything, included the horrible scenes. And everything in this picture has a sense.

For me Psycho is the best movie I have ever watched, and it will probably be the best forever.",10
10 February 2008,The first of a kind,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9
22 January 2013,Everyone should see this movie!!!,"It depressed me when I accepted that I am probably the only one in my entire class who liked old, classic movies. True, it's kinda geeky, but it is still one of those things that I've always loved. In this same way I became interested in Alfred Hitchcock and his work, specifically Psycho. The first time I watched it, I absolutely loved it. The story, acting, screenplay, writing, art direction, everything was spot on and beautifully executed. I literally found no flaws with this movie. I was telling my friends about it and they didn't seem interested when I told them that this movie was made in 1960. After a few weeks, I went over to a friend's house and I made them watch it, no matter what. They think they've seen scary movies, (TCM, Friday the 13th, etc.) but when they watched Psycho, I've never seen someone so involved in a movie. They, just as I was when I first watched it, were yelling at the screen, covering their eyes, gasping every so often, and when it ended, they agreed that it was one of the best movies they have ever watched. They were completely intrigued by diversity of the movie compared to today's horror and thriller movies that they love. I asked them if they would watch more Alfred Hitchcock and they said, ""Of course!"" What I'm saying is that this movie is amazing, certainly Alfred Hitchcock's best work and the greatest thriller/horror of all time, and that if anyone who is reading this and is in the ""youth of America""; give classic (old) movies a chance!! It might be something you have to get used to, it being in black and white and all, but look past that and focus on the story and characters, and I promise you it will not fail to impress.",
28 April 2016,A class apart from its time.,"It took me lot of convincing to watch another black and white movie but this movie was totally worth it. A film like this takes you to inexplicable journey of human relations and shows in as simple way as possible.The movie is interesting and keeps you glued from your chair. The directorial style of Hitchcock spellbinds you once you are halfway through the film. The starting of film seems pretty slow but as the movie keeps on going, it reveals an unorthodox relation between a son and his dominating mother thus giving a viewers a complete worth of their time. In all it's a movie one should watch to explore the extent of domination in a relationship.

20 July 2013,its quite good a watch,"Psycho English, 1960 Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller Direction: Alfred Hitchcock Cast: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, John Gavin IMDb: 8.6/10

A movie is called a classic when the story it tells still remains valid even years after it was released. In that sense, master director Alfred Hitchcock's psychological thriller is very easily a classic. What starts seemingly as a satire on human behavior, quite unexpectedly changes gears and becomes a crime thriller. There are moments where one actually holds his breath. The plot goes like this: A Phoenix secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. The story initially revolves around this secretary, Marion (Janet Leigh), but drifts after some point of time. I won't discuss too much about the story in my reviews as I myself hate to know the story of a movie before watching it. The background music is quite fitting. Psycho's definitely worth your 1 hour and 48 minutes.",7

20 October 2007,We're all caught in our private traps...,"""We're all caught in our private traps, we scratch and claw at the air, at each other, but for all of it, we never budge an inch"".

Yes, ""Psycho"" is missing the vibrancy of ""North by Northwest"", vividity of ""Vertigo"", ambiguity of ""The Birds"", and claustrophobia of ""Rear Window"", but it is a unique movie in its very own league. With Hitchcock's sharp eye with little details, genius camera angles, and keen sense of generating suspense and tension, ""Psycho"" is multi-layered and richly-textured film, actually this is Master's last great picture.

The film starts out very slowly. During the first hour, Hitchcock focuses on a single specific event and takes the viewer somewhat familiar point mostly seen in classic film noirs: a confused woman, being stuck in an impasse with a lover bogged down in financial woes, steals money off her employer. Things becomes to go awry en route California (where her lover lives), while she encounters some ""MacGuffins"" such as a mysterious patrolman and suspicious used-car salesman, both are the harbingers of incipient tension and terror. Her edgy trip ends in a sleazy motel off the main highway in a rainy night. Hitchcock startles the viewer while central female antagonist dies half-way through the film, and takes us another sinister place where the real secret is revealed. From this point, Anthony Perkins lead the show as twitchy motel keeper with peculiar idiosyncrasies. This is the role of his life, as everybody is waiting horrified whenever this schizoid time bomb will go off.

From the very beginning, Hitchcock imbues the film with a heavy atmosphere of impending doom. Blood-chilling strings of composer Bernard Herrmann adds greatly to the overall moodiness. Today's horror/thrillers depend too much on graphic violence, where blood, gore, decapitations, and dismembered bodies galore. Not overly violent and with almost no blood and gore, the unshakable effectiveness ""Psycho"" mutters up comes from what is implied, but not shown. He always used to make the audience use their imagination. This is the greatness of Hitchcock.

Now for the downside, I found the second half of the film somewhat forced. Private eye Arbogast's insatiable obsession with Norman and his ill mother is totally unconvincing. Lila's (Marion's sister) intuition about something bad had happened in the motel is groundless. Sam and Lila's visit to the motel and their sureness about Marion's stay in room number 1 is totally implausible. Also, the secret of the film is predictable half-way through, as soon as all the pieces are put in proper places. But, neither of these weak points undermine the cleverness and effectiveness of this great piece of cinema. ""Psycho"" is definitely a classic and deserves to be called so.",9

12 June 2015,"Marion Crane makes off with forty thousand dollars from one of her company's clients, but decides to return it after staying one night at an empty motel run by a Norman Bates.","The plot was small, but interesting and I enjoyed how the scenes were shot and cut, but considering how this is not the early 60's anymore, people shouldn't watch the movie if they want to get scared because the story itself isn't all that thrilling, not because it was badly written, but because the plot twists have been dulled due to their being so famous now. Janet Leigh, a popular name back in the day and Jamie Lee Curtis's mother, has enough screen time for her character to be better appreciated and Anthony Perkins's portrayal of Norman Bates is both amiable and creepy. I would recommend watching the movie as a regular movie rather than a horror movie because the picture is still beautiful and the story is interesting, but it's just not all that scary anymore.

We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",8
7 November 2009,Still terrified,"I would bet any money anyone would care to mention that no one in the whole history of film viewing was more terrified as I was after watching Psycho. It appeared on BBC1 for the very first time back in 1968 and as I was only 11 years old I started to watch it with my mum despite warnings of the horror it would hold. After about half an hour my mum had to pick my dad up from work, but my gran was in the house in bed so I decided to watch it on my own, big mistake, my mum and dad arrived home shortly after Arbogast copped it on the stairs to find me shaking like a leaf with a poker in my hand. I went to bed after it had finished, never slept, in fact I never slept for weeks, that haunting slow music when Janet Leigh takes the money out of the newspaper in the garage toilet still gives me the creeps, if anyone has ever been more scared by a film then heaven help them.

21 November 2002,Brilliantly Done,"This movie will forever hold a special place in most of our hearts. Hitchcock did not have to show much in order for us to be frightened. He simply played upon our imaginations, knowing that we the audience will see everything in our dreams. Psycho also sets itself apart in the fact that most movies hardly do justice to the book, but in this case I believe we have an exception. Brilliantly done and a must watch for all true movie lovers.

4 February 2018,Wow,"My favorite of Hitchcock's films. Anthony Perkins was way ahead of his time as an actor. You could literally transport him into the present day and drop him in just about any movie and he'd shine. I'd give the movie a 10 if it weren't for some 1950's dialogue moments with the detective. Maybe I should look past that? Otherwise, perfect movie.

25 January 2009,*Classic* written all over.,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

24 February 2010,A Benchmark in Cinema,"If you have not seen this film, watch it. Simply because it is Hitchcock's most suspenseful, intricate psychological thriller that has ever been known. It has influenced every horror film in some way.

Beginning in Pheonix, Arizona, Marion Crane is having her lunch hour in a hotel room with a married man. They discuss marriage, and money. Later, a discontented Marion easily steals $40,000 to help fix her problems. Frightened, she leaves town and shakes off a policeman and she swaps her car. Later it starts raining and she spends a quiet evening at the Bates Motel...

The acting is amazing, especially Anthony Perkins as the innocent, troubled Norman Bates. Bernard Hermann's score is suitably eerie and years ahead of its time, complementing George Tomasini's interesting editing. Add all its shocking ingredients, the famous shower scene and a Hitchcock cameo and you have a perfect film.

29 February 2004,kin with War and Peace,"What do I mean by kin to War and Peace (required reading in many colleges)? Well, first of all, they're both overrated, over quoted peaces of tripe that somehow against all odds come back to haunt our every step in adult life.

This is a movie to see once, at most, to be culturally literate. If you don't recognize the psycho music by the second note, you must've just broken out of your protective bubble.

This movie is a one time classic but not a flick to waste money on adding to your collection. Why anyone would think this scary, creepy, or even thought provoking, I cannot say because what so many say of it I can not see.

Many other movies worthy of classic horror movies have been made since and thrown into the shadows of this long gone flick. My tip? Watch Fallen (starring Denzel Washington) instead.

16 October 2007,!better than a lot of modern day horror films!,"I really liked the movie but I don't think that it lived up to what I had expected I to be. Don't get me wrong it really was a very good film but It had been hyped up so much that I thought it was going to become my favorite. The movie is about a young woman who is having an affair with a married man. The man she is having an affair with is not financially stable to be able to leave his wife and pay alimony. When her boss asks her to deposit 40,000 dollars in the bank for him she decides to take the money instead. She decides to drive to California from Arizona to meet him and start a life with him.

Her journey there is very suspenseful, she gets followed by a police officer and you could tell that he's onto her. The police officer even follows her into a car dealership where she decides to trade in her car for a new one. At this point I am already jumping out of my seat because of the music that Hitchcock uses to follow the action in the movie. I can see why the soundtrack to the movie made it even better but I couldn't stand it! It was driving me nuts I had no idea when to expect something bad to happen, I guess it did its job because it sure had me at the edge of my seat.

I guess the one thing that did bother me was the pace of the movie, I felt like it was just way too slow. Perhaps this is just because it was in black and white so it seemed a little duller and slow to me. When I was watching it I already knew to expect the shower scene to be the best scene of all. I was absolutely shocked that it happened so fast in the movie. This movie is very well known but the shower scene is infamous so for it to take place so early in the movie it really made me wonder where the movie was going to go next. It is the biggest turning point in the movie, but I have to say it didn't really scare me. Don't get me wrong I love the fact that it was not gory but I just didn't think it was very realistic. Im sure that is just because I have already seen so many movies that were brutally gruesome but considering that this one wasn't it definitely made its point without giving away the identity of the killer. The end of the movie was mind blowingly hilarious and terrifying all at the same time, I don't want to give the ending away but its definitely something that you don't see coming. The twist reminded me of the feeling I had when I watched the sixth sense, it was that good! Overall I have to say the movie was pretty good, the climax and twist definitely makes up for any other shortcomings that the film might have had. I just wish I had been around when it first came out, Im sure that I would have appreciated it a lot more.",9

2 July 2006,This is Hitchcock at his very best.,"Psycho is a perfect example of what a suspense film should be. Made over 40 years ago but well ahead of its time. This is undoubtedly one of Hitchcock's best.

Performances are top notch - particularly Anthony Perkins as the troubled Norman Bates, a role which I believe could've been very clichéd.

The shower scene really stood the test of time - and yet you never actually see any contact with the knife on the skin. Yet, the mood and the music really make you agree that this is one of the scariest moments ever in film.

I love films with twist endings, and this is a darn good example.

10/10 Recommendation: If you enjoyed Psycho - I would recommend Les Diaboliques (1955), another brilliant suspense film.",10
12 May 2013,You Must See It - Psycho,"My 5 Reasons You Must See It

1. It is as good as advertised - Many movies have trouble standing the test of time, but this one is great and there is a reason for the high rating

2. Anthony Perkins - He is brilliant in this movie and plays the part to a tee. It is hard to imagine a creepier portrayal of Norman Bates.

3. Hitchcock Directs It - Arguably the best director of all time and this happens to be arguably his best film.

4. The Shower Scene - It contains one of the most famous horror/thriller scenes of all time.

5. The Score - It has an amazing score to accompany the film and the music from the shower scene still lives on with force today.

Recommend for:

1. Anyone who hasn't seen it - It really is worth a watch for anyone who hasn't seen it. You will not be disappointed.

2. Film Students - A great study for how a film should be made and it should be required for every film student.

3. Classic Movie Fans - I can't imagine any classic movie fan not seeing this film and odds are they have already watched it numerous times.

31 August 2013,The Horror That Started It All.,"As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he ""Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman"". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.",9

The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
9 June 2015,You need to watch Psycho!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

24 February 2017,"Amazing, timeless, gem of a movie","I've recently started watching older day movies, and after being bored of a few, i finally got to Psycho and was amazed by it, even me, the film snob my friends call me, loved this film, it didn't even seem as old as it is, and I enjoyed every moment. I even want to see the sequels (even if its true they're bad) because of how much this film was fantastic.

22 March 2018,Blew my mind,"I personally thought this was just some kind of regular murder story, but i was completely wrong. Don't underestimate it by it's age. That movie haunted me for a couple of moths-afraid to be outside by myself in the evenings at my country place.

Psycho might have a mentally deep effect on you, 'cause it's quite intense. For person who isn't into horror films or hasn't quite seen one before, this is a great movie to watch. Although, people are different and every one seems films differently, I really hope you'll like it.

Still remains to be one of my favorites, because it surprised me and blew my mind. If you haven't seen it, I warmly recommend not to get too much information about it, you might spoil it and might not enjoy it that much! Hitchcock strictly said the same about Psycho.

22 January 2006,Greatest film ever made,"This film is no doubt Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film, but it is my belief that this film is the greatest film ever made. What film has given more inspiration to directors down the years. From the opening scene to the brilliant ending no film gives more tension and brilliance than this masterpiece. Its one of those perfect edge of your seat films that's brilliant every time you watch. Like even a scene where Janet Leigh is just driving a car is Scary!! So tense. Its such a great film because it starts of with what you think is a lady (Marion Crane) having an affair with a hardware store owner (Sam Loomis) Marion wants to run away with Sam so she steals some money from a bank she works in and takes of to meet Sam. Whilst on her Journey she has confrontations with a policeman and a car sales-man but nothing could have prepared her for her stay at the Bates motel. A huge mistake. This is where the story totally changes she's murdered in the shower! but who did it? In the words of Mr Hitchcock ""don't give away the ending"".

18 November 2018,Brilliantly Scripted,"At first i thought Marion Crane would be the main character, but then she was killed and i really hard to figure out who's gonna reveal the psychotic that Norman Bates have, and then come another characters brilliantly added.

It's really great movie plot I've ever seen, it is simple but the end of the movie is mind blown, twisted nicely.

25 February 2006,Thriller,"Wonderful movie. It had me glued to my seat from start to finish. Anthony Perkins was superb. He played the part so well. I can't think of another actor who could portray Norman Bates the way he did. Even the rest of the cast of characters were excellent. I don't think they should have ever attempted to do a remake of the film. It could never be done in the manner Alfred Hitchcock did it. He had an incredible mind. After watching the remake, I had to watch the original again. What a difference in all respects. I have seen ""Psycho"" (the original) at least twenty times and never get tired of it. Absolutely great movie.

13 May 2006,a must see!!!!!,"Wow. A work of art. I am a young reviewer that has seen many movies from many different genres and I know great movie when I see one. I am currently 14 and saw this movie on my ninth birthday. My father started getting me interested in Hitchcock movies around the age of five. Of course, on my ninth birthday i didn't forget the promise and I rented it from visart video. Ever since then I am a fanatic with a loss of words for such a superior film. this film is not just for horror fans out there but drama fans too. The question the movie leaves you when it is over has hooked many watchers as I have been told. Many people have seen this classic but If you are one of the few that hasn't then you must rent this movie or your life will never be the same. This is by far my favorite movie(yes it even beat my other favorite""the godfather"") and it will be high on your favorite list too.I promise

18 September 2019,"Fun and not bad, however gets too much credit","Fun and not bad at all film. But I don't understand why it gets so much credit when it's a simple plot driven film and made around the same time (and even later) of films such as The Seventh Seal, Pickpocket and La Strada for example. (Except for being a thriller). However, indeed a well made thriller, especially for the time. Fun watch.

The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9

18 October 2007,ALfred Hitchcock! what a genius,"After watching the documentary on Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick, I have noticed that their styles and ways of doing things are very different. The one thing I noticed is that when Alfred Hitchcock was with Selznick the stories showed more compassion and had to do a lot more about romance. I saw a preview of Gone with the Wind It was very different then the movie Psycho, the action in Gone with the Wind was very dry and had a since of just being put there the main focus of the story was mostly on love. As for the Hitchcock movie Psycho that I watch completely of, his way showed a different way of looking at styles of camera angles and the story had almost no romance and lots of scary action and suspense. In my mind even though Selznick made one big success it doesn't compare to Hitchcock's powerful way of filming and creating such powerful works of art. In a way I could say that Selznick portrays his ideas as a romantic but in real life does not have any of the qualities, but as for Hitchcock as looking at his movies you see a very excluded man with some problems, but once again a complete opposite. One of my favorite seen in the movie Psycho was the shower seen the other was when the man gets stabbed and ""roll"" down the stairs, very ingenious on Hitchcock's part.",
17 December 2001,The master has done his job,"I've just seen this mother of all horrormovies and I'm scared out of my witts. While the first part of the movie with Janet Leigh running off and acting all strange seems a bit peculiar to me, it is essential for the latter stage to be involved with her character so the shock would be greater. The showerscene is the best plottwist I've ever seen! I could imagine that if the viewer knew nothing what this film is about, this scene would be a total surprise. There are no words to describe the feeling from going from an edgy but still safe and sound mind to absolute panic. The last scene with the unveiling of the killer in the sinister Bates house is one of the most frightening things I've ever seen. I will never forget the face of Anthony Perkins laughing with delight while rushing down the basement. Hitchcock has done his job. The horrific images of this movie from the master of suspense will forever be printed in my mind.

31 March 2023,"Very good classic, Perkins is outstanding!","A woman goes on the run after stealing $40,000 from her employee. Exhausted and traveling on the back roads to avoid the police, she stops for the night at the Bates Motel and meets the proprietor Norman Bates. A man with an interest in taxidermy and a difficult relationship with his mother.

Arguably the first ""slasher"" movie. Anthony Perkins does an incredible job in the role as Norman Bates. While I would not consider this movie scary and it definitely does have the gore factor that would come in later slashers, this is still such a good movie. It has held up so well and is a fun watch. The acting is great all the way around, it is a little creepy at times, and the shower scene is one of the most famous scenes in movie history. Love this movie!

19 November 2002,Brilliant,"What can i say about this film that hasn't been said before= Its crap, pathetic and doesn't make a 2 year old jump. But it isn't it is a classic and still has the power to get the girls squeling in fear. Hitchcock has put so much work into this film that it always was going to be a classic and it deserves to be it is just fantastic.

5 February 2003,The Best From the Master,"Is there any better suspense film maker than Alfred Hitchcock? Was there a better Hitchcock movie than ""Psycho""? I don't think so. Not only did this movie genuinely freak me out at times, but it was much more intelligent and believable than most horror or suspense movies since this one. The story was excellent, and the music was perfect as well: chilling, scary, and creepy. The performances in the movie were very good as well, especially Anthony Perkins. All of these aspects of the movie make it a wonderfully done movie that is second to none is the realm of suspense movies. If you miss this one, you're insane.

30 May 2020,Immersive,"This is the first American 'classic' movie that I've watched, and after some of the Italian classics that I've seen this one comes next as the oldest one.

Given that this a 60 year old movie few scenes & some dialogues are somewhat odd, but apart from it, the film is quite immersive & suspenseful.

29 October 2003,"Im still thinking, 3 months on...","Psycho (1960) Director: Alfred Hitchcock Writer: Robert Bloch (Novel), Jospeh Stefano (Screen play) Stars: Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates), Janet Leigh (Marion Crane), Vera Miles (Lila Crane), Martin Balsam (Detective Arbogast), John Gavin (Sam Loomis).

Psycho is a classic horror film and is the one that set the standard for all future movies of the genre. It was released in 1960 (And then remade in 1998), and regarded as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film. I made the mistake of watching the remake first, but I watched the original while at my sister's house and could tell which one was better. I could clearly see why this is probably the greatest horror film ever made, and by history's best director.

The events of the movie left me in awe, and an instant Hitchcock fan. The film starts in Phoenix, Arizona where Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real estate agent receptionist, is trusted to deliver a large sum of money from a customer and put it in the bank. However, Marion's wicked side takes control and causes her to flee from the city to her boyfriend's (John Gavin) house in California. Due to her suspicious acts, she attracts the attention of a policeman, forcing her to trade her car in. Soon the trademark stormy weather causes more troubles for Marion, making her spend the night at the mysterious hotel, with 12 cabins, 12 vacancies, and 12 showers. Marion's story soon evolves when she meets the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and learns he has a dark past of his own. From then on the plot twists will shock you, and the suspense will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat.

Perkins is very convincing as Bates, and the way he fills the role of mother's-boy Norman is certainly impressive. Janet Leigh offers a great supporting role, and makes you feel sorry for throughout the film, despite her character's evil deeds. Balsam, for the short period he is in the film, gives that classic detective character whom we all know and love.

The setting is possibly one of the best sets in Hollywood, because it is so eerie and mysterious. The Bates mansion, which overlooks the motel, sends chills down your spine as you see the dark silhouette sitting by the window. The camera work for the film contributed greatly to its success, like many other Hitchock films. The affects are astounding for a 1960 film. Hitchock's decision to film in black and white paid off, as it gave the movie charm, and hid the fact most of the blood was just chocolate sauce. The music is the most famous movie music ever- the screeching violin in sync with the killer's knife landing on their victim. Psycho has been parodied again and again, because it so popular. It was followed by Psycho II (1982), Psycho III (1986) and psycho IV: The beginning (1990). The movie may not be appreciated so much by younger viewers, but anyone old enough will love how the film is shot, written and acted, as well as making you think. Watch this classic at night, with the lights off. And if you don't like being scared, shower before the movie.",
26 March 2012,Hitchcockian Thrilla!!,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion.

7 August 2004,Would've been scary for 1960's audiences...,"I really enjoyed this movie!

Before I saw this movie I had a pre-conceived idea that it would be absolutely terrifying (as I did before seeing The Exorcist).

Putting the movie in context with its time (1960), I actually realized that it was really frightening!

In 1960, this movie sent people fleeing down the theatre aisles.

The murder scenes are very creative in terms of angles used, even though they won't scare you, as today we've been de-sensitised by movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

However, the psychological aspect of the movie and of course the mystery is what will entertain you, no blood and guts here.

The movie really pioneered the idea of mental illness as the killer, moving away from crimes of passion and greed being motives.

Watch this movie and then appreciate it for being a pioneer of all the great thriller and horror movies we have now.",

18 May 2013,Thrills beyond belief and spectacular story-telling and an unforgettable experience.,"Psycho. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Based on the novel by Robert Bloch. Starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin. Rated R with a running time of 109 minutes. Given an 8.6/10 on IMDb.com and 97% Fresh on Rottentomatoes.com

""A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and subsequently encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.""

""Bates Motel"" the modern prequel series to Psycho has left me absolutely intrigued. I had heard of Hitchcock's masterpiece but I had never actually seen and with myself being an immense film addict, how could I have possibly missed such a remarkable gem? I'd known the entire plot. Every twist turn and stab. I honestly thought I was capable of understanding exactly what I was going to get here, but boy was I wrong. Thrills beyond belief and spectacular story-telling.

Alfred Hitchcock is an absolute cinematic genius. Choosing to keep the film in black and white, killing off his protagonist halfway through the film, pushing and pulling the audience in every direction he wants them to be in. His camera angles and overall eye for entertainment has yet to be matched by any modern filmmaker. This man and this film are not only responsible for revolutionizing the horror genre, but showing the world the validity of it. Expect to be mesmerized by this piece.

We are given Anthony Perkins, who doesn't just play the role of Norman Bates, but he becomes him. The character is embodied with such power and perfection that seeing Perkins in any role but this terrifies me beyond belief. Vera Miles and John Gavin team up as Lila Crane and Sam Loomis. Together they weave a team of compassionate and caring people, searching for answers in a mind bending mystery. Miles performs beautifully. She's innocent and loving and just wants to find her sister, but there's this air to her that strikes me, making me wonder how complex Lila is capable of being. If you're able to portray a character to the point that a viewer wishes to know more about that character, I give you the utmost respect. John Gavin as Sam Loomis bored me at the start but soon he became ideal. Loomis and Bates are compared and contrasted in an ironically obvious but eye-opening light. They are both extremely handsome men but Loomis is intimidating, strong, manly. Whereas, Norman Bates is a shy, childish, coward. The scenes where the two actors battle in out in conversation kept me on the edge of my seat. Once again, I have to add that Anthony Perkins is a genius and every motion, reaction, and word that comes from him in this film delivers an unforgettable experience.

My only complaint worth noting is the scene in which the psychologist explains Norman and His Mother to the audience. It's a bit drawn out and the psychologist is delivering shocking and heartbreaking information but there seems to be little reaction from him or anyone in the room. Rather than telling me what happened, I'd have rather seen it for myself, Something that's easy to do in film. But this scene is necessary and it won't take a single thing away from this movie.

Overall, Psycho is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's a horrifying thrill-ride with a twist that no one will ever see coming and what it did for the movie world will never be forgotten. Alfred Hitchcock toys with our wildest emotions and fears and spawns a true work of art. I'll have to ask my mother what she thought of the film because, well, mother knows best. But, I'd say that if you decide that Bates Motel has No Vacany's for you, well Norman and I will both in form you that we have 12 Vacancy's and all 12 should be filled by you.",10
22 September 2013,How refreshing!,"Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is just.....wow.",9

Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",1
5 May 2016,Psycho Review for English 481,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects.

23 February 2019,"Great, but not a horror movie","I've seen this movie on the top of most horror movies on all time, and when I found out that the director is Hitchcock, I've got and seen it instantly. It's a great movie (naturally) but in horror genre, it cant be the first one, even when you compare it with the movies created on those days.

22 July 2016,my experience,"lastly I took the time to watch this famous movie I loved a lot although at the beginning I was unmotivated to watch it .in that time they were able to make a perfect film with a limited budget I think the actor play was pretty good .with this movie I realized that the movies in black and white can be very good .the decor and the character made a perfect match in this movie .Alfred Hitchcock is a genius moreover for me those actors are completely unknown.regarding the story is really well done I can yet add that the clothes and the building were come from a other world that is why is important for teenagers to realize the changing between the current movies and the older movies

9 May 2018,Quiet Simplicity,"I think the quiet simplicity of this film is why it remains to this day one of my favorite horror movies. It is a film that could never be successfully reproduced. There are epic scenes in this movie that have become iconic pieces of history. I watch this movie frequently!!

8 May 2004,Best Movie EVER,"This is the best movie I have ever seen! I love Alfred Hitchcock's films but this was my favorite. Right after seeing the movie I got the book. Norman Bates sucked in the book, he was fat and bald etc. he is way better in the movie.

I heard that the remake is a total piece of crap, so I've never watched that one and I don't really want to. If you haven't seen this movie then WATCH IT! If you have seen it and really liked it then I recommend seeing some of his others like Vertigo, The Lady Vanishes or The Man Who Knew Too Much. I Definitely give this movie 10/10.

8 June 2006,a masterpiece of a film,"i first saw this film many years ago. I think it is one of the best films i have ever seen. I think it still stands up in our age and will for along time to come. The tension in the film is remarkable, this film was ahead of its time and many directors have seen this film and it would have inspired them like it has inspired me. AlfredHitchcockhis the best director of all time. He has made some of the best films of all time including rear window, vertigo, strangers on a train and the birds too name but a few. I would like to say that Alfred Hitchcock has changed my outlook on life and i will carry on watching his films for along time to come. One last thing is that the best film he ever directed is vertigo in my opinion.

The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",7

4 December 2006,Aesthetics,"Psycho is more than another horror film. Every minute of this movie is dedicated to guiding the audience in a certain direction and playing on expectations. The incredible style in which it was shot was monumental and taboo for the day. Through the brilliant editing, controlled releasing of information and camera techniques Hitchcock was successfully able to create a classic horror movie. What truly separates Psycho is from other horror movies, including today's horror movies, is the element of surprise and importance on a solid well-written script. Once a solid story was created Hitchcock made Psycho a visual work of art that upholds today as one of the best horror films to date.

10 August 2006,maybe too scared?,"I rented this movie for my friends birthday party this weekend. We LOVE scary movies. . they're the only things we watch whenever we have parties. but we're only. . . 14. . 15. i've read about how good this movie is from all the reviews that you guys wrote. but its rated R. . so maybe its TOO scary? i mean.. . i was reading this Alfred Hitchcock biography that my friend had. . and there was this picture of mothers corpse on their and nearly scared me to death. so i know everybody loves this movie and its the greatest horror flick of all time. but do you think its too scary for us to handle? and i know the shower scene is. . infamous. . but did any of you guys dread taking showers after watching that scene in the movie? knowing me. . i'll probably stink up the whole school because i'll be scared to death. so will we have nightmares. . forever?

19 October 2020,Sobrevalorada,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale.

9 September 2006,The quintessential psychological thriller. Magic.,"""Psycho"" is the ultimate suspense film. The plot is superbly developed and exhilaratingly full of psychological manipulation. It is without any hum-our - voluntary or involuntary - whatsoever, but this only adds to the clarity and starkness of the story, and above all of the images. They stick to your retina and stay lodged in your brain for ever - resemblant of ""Potemkin"" - but without the stills effect. And to round it off, the real mark of excellence: a brilliant ending. I remember coming out of the movie theater after seeing ""Psycho"" for the first time, at the age of 16. I was devastated. Drained. I instinctively knew there was something deeply truthful in this film. Just like ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Disturbing - but absolutely credible. Which - of course - would not have been possible without good actors. So turn off the lights, shut out the world around you, and I can guarantee you will be sucked into this ""flick"".

23 October 2001,Scariest and best movie i've ever seen,"I was not even a gleam in my father's eye when this movie was made, and yet this movie is as scary now as I'm sure it was then. ""Scary"" movies these days generally do not scare me at all. Alfred Hitchcock's movies have always had an uncanny ability to scare the wits out of me. Particular Vertigo and this movie. The Birds was scary also, but not as disturbing as these. Now, about this review. I had never seen this before and on a boring Saturday evening I decided to go buy this dvd from the local store. So, I got it and watched it that night. I watched it with the lights out, my surround system cranked, and on the edge of my seat the whole time. I cannot tell you how many times my heart skipped a beat in this movie. The music, the photography, the lighting, everything combined to make this a movie that I will not forget. The music in the shower scene that is repeated at the very end (screeching violins) is forever engrained in my memory. I tried watching this movie again by myself today and I cannot do it. That is how scary it is. Anthony Perkins is amazing. Everyone in the cast is amazing, but his is the performance that you will remember from this movie.

Now, about the dvd. This dvd is incredible. A 90-minute making of Psycho is incredible. There is also a trailer, another documentary, and tons of other good stuff. They really crammed a lot onto this dvd to make it worth your money. The video quality is crystal clear. The audio quality is stupendous. It is only Dolby Digital stereo though. Just be sure to crank this one to let Bernard Herrmanns score scare you out of your mind. To sum it up, do not rent this dvd, this dvd belongs in your collection so do yourself a favor and go rent it. But do not watch it by yourself unless you are brave.",10
1 December 2001,Excellent,"This is by far Alfred Hitchcocks greatest film of his career, and that is something very special.

Anyway you must see this film, if you have not seen it then where have you been for the last 4 decades. An absolute classic.

7 May 2008,clever alternate soundtrack,"I just found this online. This group called Jokr has released a 2CD album of music that they call PSYCHOsync. It's supposed to be a synchronized match-up with Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" with their own music replacing Bernard Herrmann's original score. Of course, Herrmann's soundtrack is classic, iconic and could not be improved upon, but this haunting pop music wrings out different story lines and emotion than what is evident in the original. It reminds me of what they say you can do with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and ""The Wizard of Oz."" You can check out their music streaming at jokrcode dot com.

It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9

23 May 2007,the best film EVER!,"This is without a doubt the best film i've ever seen, it never fails to scare me and it has the best and most chilling plot ever. Hitchcock's finest hour, not only his best film, but the best film ever made! it has some of the most classic scenes that has have been imitated but never mastered, the shower scene everybody knows, even if you haven't seen the movie, the absolutely terrifying final scenes in the fruit cellar is perfect horror. Anthony Perkins is so brilliant in the role that you will never be rid of the image of the character that is Norman bates, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and John Gavin are also brilliant and create a tense atmosphere that really chills you. 100% movie making.

3 August 2002,"The Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!!!!(in my opinion, anyway)","I love this movie!!! It's my all-time absolute favorite movie in the entire world! I have seen this movie approximately 20 - 25 times and it still scares the crap out of me! No one, but no one, BUT ANTHONY PERKINS could ever be Norman Bates. Alfred Hitchcock is perhaps the best director and filmmaker in history! His films are the films which inspire young people like myself to become filmmakers, and film historians, and Hitchcock scholars, and to choose many other film careers. It's just beyond my ability to express my love for this movie. This was the first Hitchcock film I had ever seen, and will remain my favorite film for the rest of my life. I even have the soundtrack! Best movie in the world, a little cheesy by today's standards but who cares, it will make you grip the edge of your seat and your eyes pop out. SEE IT! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!

13 October 2002,"Thank you, Hitch","I saw Psycho for the first time when I was seventeen; I saw it for the second time in August 2001. By that time, nothing has been the same. I love Psycho because of two main reasons: 1) in this movie you will find the best shots and the best way of directing of the cinema history; 2)Psycho is best and the easiest way to describe the human being: dreams, nightmares, hopes, obsessions, fears, wills. I'll always be grateful to Hitch for this movie: thank you, Alfred. P.S. Thanks also to Bernard Herrmann, for his dreadful but wonderful soundtrack (""the screaming violins"") and to the unforgettable Norman Perkins for his interpretation of the great Norman Bates. You'll always have a special place in my heart.

14 October 2008,Classic Horror Film,"This is an excellent horror film. However it does not contain a lot of gore nor is it particularly scary. It is suspenseful and has an interesting twist in the plot. The music and sound effects are well done. The black and white doesn't take anything away from the film at all. The film is perfectly named as the main character is about as nuts as you can get. The overall acting was good. The few violent scenes looked pretty cheesy, but for its time not horrible. Would recommend this film to any level of viewer from newbie all the way to movie buff. I read that this was based on Ed Gein lightly, same as Texas chainsaw massacre and Silence of the Lambs.

5 November 2002,The Ultimate Movie,"A near perfect film that few today can see in its intended state, ie not knowing anything about it! Hitch masterfully lulls is into thinking the film will be about a girl who takes off with a load of money - yet that has no relevance to the film in the slightest (other than to scare the hell out of you when she dies). I actually watched this film not knowing that Norman Bates was his mother and ultimately gained more from the film than a lot of people that I know have watched it. Perfect score to the film by Bernard Herrmann which adds to the tension - see especially the music as marion is driving in the rain, and note how the windscreen wipers are a metaphor for the knife the rain is also used like the water from the shower (almost hinting at what will follow) Superb film from the master of suspense! 10/10

23 September 2009,Psycho 1960,"The original screening of ""Psycho"" was released at the former (untitled) Westwood theatre at Pico and Westwood Blvd. in Westwood California, (since than that theatre has been replaced by the Westwood Mall.) A selected invitational viewing was privately projected for the guests, cast and crew prior to it's release. As an undisclosed surreptitiously disguised Hitchcock enigma, this version was edited with a subliminal avant-garde inclusion of a craftily illustrated ""Skull and Crossbones symbol"" and spliced into the film after every nine frames of the shower and detective's butchering scenes. Whether or not once the film industry's critics discovered and banned this effect and allowed Hitchcock to continue projecting this version extensively was unknown, but by the time this well-scripted ""Psycho"" was publicly released the fear factor had already been commonly reputed. The silence, suspended action, proceeded by the dramatic music, and the aerial jump cut filming made it a sleepless producing journey of celluloid-fanaticism.

After attending this private screening I was scared out of my innocent mind. A few weeks proceeded and upon it's release to the local theaters, rumor had it that the shrewd Hitchcock created some hanky-panky with this film, so we examined the reel from our local theater's projection room, and discovered the subconscious inclusion of his secret confidential editing. Due to the critical film industry's mere political influence, Hitchcock had to remove this phenomenal strategy. By its reputation alone since ""Nosferatu,"" ""Psycho"" had already stood patented as the most horrifying visual experience ever. ""Psycho"" really didn't need any editing enhancement. Viewing it again recently still sends chills through my skin!

The psychiatrist at the climax of this film played a key role and scene of it's finale who explained the events of the nature of what took place at this spine-tingling escapade.

The geniuses of Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins will not be forgotten...may they Rest In Peace.",10
21 October 2009,My favorite movie,"Exceptional movie. I'm a particular fan of horrors, but I hate the ones that are all gore and no plot. Psycho has hardly any gore, but got me yelling with satisfying fright.

Black and white really works with this movie. It's easier to see ominous shadows and I was tense the whole time, on the alert for flickering shapes. The images were beautifully taped. The plot is complex and very thought-provoking, and went along well with my love for all things psychology.

My favorite movie changes nearly monthly, but this is definitely going to be my favorite for a long while. Shortly after seeing it, I couldn't stop thinking about it and I researched my favorite scenes on Youtube and made my computer desktop a picture of Norman Bates.

Only Hitchcock could have made such a great film!",10

22 April 2003,Greatest thriller of all time,"Never before has a director captivated an audience more than when Alfred Hitchcock did it with the release of his 1960 film, `Psycho'. This film starring Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins attracted never-ending lines at the box office and sent the viewers home fearing for their own lives. `Psycho', which is referred to by Robin Wood as `perhaps the most terrifying film ever made' did not become a classic because it is an excellent shocker, but because it contains immensely deep themes, images and ideas that came together perfectly. This is a film that will never be duplicated, not even by the great Gus Van Sant. There are many elements that fused together to make this film the ideal horror film of all time. One major component that was essential to the effectiveness of `Psycho' was the casting. Janet Leigh plays the typical 1950's bombshell. She is calm, reserved, and very lady-like. However she shares something in common with almost all the other characters in this movie. Like her coworker with her tranquilizers, her boss with his bottle of whiskey, Cassidy with his tax-evading ways, and Norman with the obvious twist, Merion has a secret. She is involved in a sexual relationship with a man that is deeply in debt. This ultimately leads to her stealing the money and winding up in a disastrous situation. To the audience Leigh represents a good-looking version of an everyday American woman, letting the audience know that this kind of thing can happen to anybody. Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins is also perfectly cast. He is a very sensitive, vulnerable, and nervous character. He also seems to be stuck between boyhood and manhood, which is evident from his messy room and sworn allegiance to his mother. Together with Leigh, the two are able to create the friction and tension that is so evident throughout the entire movie. This was something that Van Sant was unable to do by casting Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn in the same roles. Heche has been a very controversial figure in the public eye over the last few years. As a result, the audience is unable to pick up the same sense of guilt that was so beautifully displayed by Leigh. Vaughn as well may have performed well in the role, however he was clearly not meant for it. One cannot simply jump from being a `swinger' to being a reserved, childish momma's boy. One of the many themes of `Psycho' is the idea that this sort of thing can happen to anybody. This is seen in the opening shot where the camera is weaving through the city, and randomly chooses a hotel room of a random high rise building. There we see two young lovers doing something that is for the most part human, although not ethical at this point in history. Merion the pockets a little cash to help her boyfriend get out of debt, so they could proceed to have a happy life together. Once again, although it is not ethical, it is not unheard of. On her way out of Phoenix Merion experiences some turbulent weather, forcing her to pull off to the side of the road to check into a motel. We all know what happens from there. The point is that it could have been any car pulling into that motel. Perhaps if another car had pulled in just before her, this never would have happened. It could have been your car. What makes `Psycho' one of the greatest thrillers of all time is audience identification. This is achieved through a series of point of view shots coming from the eyes of Merion, as well as an eerie score performed by Bernard Herrmann. This can be easily observed for the moment Merion gets in her car to leave town. By letting the audience look through the eyes of Merion, we the audience, essentially become her. The audience is in the mindset that we want her to get out of town unseen, and we hope that her boss doesn't think twice when he sees her on the road out of town. When the audience is introduced to the police officer, it is once again through the eyes of Merion. We feel her anxiety, and we want to get out of there just as much as she does. `Like her, we lose all power of rational control, and discover how easily a 'normal' person can lapse into a condition usually associated with neurosis' (Wood, 124). In the second half of the movie, the audience floats away from Merion, and to Norman. Although he has committed a harrowing act, we are still pulling for him to cover up each detail. For example, as he covers up the crime he committed, we see only hands mopping up the bathroom, our hands. The audience thinks, `Oh my, what have I done?' (Wood, 128). One thing that the remake of `Psycho' was able to do was let movie lovers realize how good of a film the original was. By assembling a perfect cast, interweaving a series of deep themes and ideas, as well as forcing the audience to identify, Hitchcock was able to take this simple film costing less than a million dollars and turn it into his masterpiece, as well as an all-time classic.",
11 August 2010,Super Thriller!,"The film Psycho is about a woman named Marion who sneaks away from her old life, after stealing a large sum of money from her employer. On her way to see her fiancé, she finds herself at the desolate Bates Motel, whose owner turns out to be the namesake for the title of the film: a psycho. After obsessing about his dead mother for so long, he psychologically turned into her persona at times. The women Norman Bates kills, were killed when his mother's persona was in charge.

The main characters are Norman Bates, and Marion Crane, portrayed by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, respectively.

The overall theme of this movie seems to deal with the uncertainty of unfamiliar people. When Marion, the main character, happens to meet the socially-awkward Norman Bates, she probably couldn't have imagined getting murdered by him. The message seems to be that you can never really know if the next person you meet is truly crazy.

A movie with a similar theme is Hitchhiker, in which a person driving across the country picks up a hitchhiker, who ultimately does many sadistic things to the driver. In that movie, it was also clear that you just don't know which strangers to trust.

Perhaps the most famous scene in Psycho is the one in which Marion is stabbed to death in the shower, frequently referred to as the ""shower scene"", in pop culture. This scene is shot and pieced together with many short clips, all shot at different angles. The constant views at different angles make the scene more suspenseful and frightening, in my opinion. Although the attacker in the scene remains obscure, it appears to be that of a woman. Ultimately, it is revealed that Norman also dresses as ""Mother"", whenever he thinks he is ""Mother"".

Another scene that best exemplifies how crazy Norman is, is the final scene, in which he's locked up in a prison cell. ""Mother"" is thinking that everyone has it wrong – he wouldn't even hurt a fly! The camera closes in upon him as ""Mother's"" thoughts are narrated. And in the close-up of Norman, an eerie feeling is truly conveyed.

When this film was first released, I think it was a first of its kind in some aspects. I think that never before, a murder had been so graphic in a movie. Although, compared to some modern movies (such as Saw), Psycho would be considered a very mild murder film.

But in any case, I believe the film was cutting-edge for the day, and remains a classic tribute to a man who truly was ""Psycho"".",10

Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10
20 October 2017,A great ride for a suspense movie.,"When I saw for the first time this movie, I don't have any idea of what it will come, or the story in yet. Except, the obvious things like The Murderer scene, or the motel. I only know that Norman is gonna turn mad at some time (I was watching the 2nd season of Bates Motel in that time) and, by the first minutes, everything that I think was ""WTF I'm I watching?"" everything was so ""happy"" in some ways that I seriously doubt that I was watching ""Psycho"", but like 40 or 30 minutes later, everything just blow up my mind. The twist that Hitchcock gives to the movie in the way that he does... just another director simply cannot do it. The minutes before the ""End"" words appears, I admit that I feel very excited about the whole film. I was so proud of being watching that film, and so awful about don't seeing before. ""Psycho"" was an ""after"" and ""before"" in my movie tastes. I totally recommend it.

20 October 2003,The Best Film Ever Made,"Now a lot of people do not agree with me, but I think that ""Psycho"" is the greatest film ever made. It is not my personal favorite, but I think as a whole, this movie is complete. The cinematography is excellent. The score sets the entire tone of the film. The acting of Anthony Perkins is chilling. I just thought that I would share that i'd bit of knowledge with you all.

10 October 2011,** Best Movie Ever!! **,"Hitchcock movies are my favorite! Psycho by far is the best of all of the Hitchcock movies. I am only 47, but have been a fan of Hitchcock movies since I was 19 and saw Psycho II in the movie theater back in 1983. When I saw the black/white clip of Psycho in the beginning of the Psycho II movie, I was hooked and had to see the original that started it all. Movies today don't come close to those made by Hitchcock back then. Remakes can never match the original. The acting was tremendous. I was always a fan of Anthony Perkins' work and loved Janet Leigh as Marion Crane. The filming, the scenery, the old cars, all of it had me hooked from the beginning. Psycho is the best!

15 November 2011,Psycho,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

6 September 2004,There is a new master of horror,"Has anyone read about this new master of horror that is on the film scene. His name is Francis Xavier and people are talking about him. He just recently finished his second feature film ""Johnny Come lately"" and word of mouth is. Its scary. People are saying this new film director is reincarnated by the master himself. Johnny Come Lately is all Alfred Hitchcock. And their are rumors that Francis Xavier wants to remake ""The Birds"". Check out www.metpix.com and read all about this new filmmaker for the ages. It will come as no surprise to see film critics hailing this young man as the new Hitchcock. It's in the making. For years, film directors have tried, Brian DePalma is one. But always seemed to fail at it. Director Francis Xavier will not fail at it.

3 August 2004,The beginning...,"This movie started it all. Since then, Hollywood made many good serial killer movies, and this here is the father of it (or should I say ""Mother""). It also defined the ""rules"" for a good horror movie: twists; creepy, mysterious and ghostlike creatures; a sinister ending and something to think about in a psychological sense. Anthony Perkins is the inspiring source to all Norman Bates, John Does, Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers crawling beneath the surface of normal life. The other actors are okay, I guess, but the best part of the movie is really Perkins.

Overall, this movie gets 10 points of 10 from me. A true masterpiece and today almost as chilling as it was 44 years ago.

16 October 2013,A masterpiece,"Hitchcock at his best! This must been one of the best suspense/thriller/ horror films i've seen. No other movie had the impact and the greatness of this. And the story behind the movie is really something, not only the book that inspired the movie but also the behind the scenes (i recommend that you take a look at the movie Hitchcock with Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren or read a little about it, it's very interesting). Perkins makes a terrific performance as Norman Bates (the best i've seen). Janet Leigh equally fantastic, and don't forget Vera Miles, John Gavin and the detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) who made also a great job. Overall the movie is really something, timeless and so much better than the remakes and sequels. It's a pioneer of horror, if you are a fan of the genre or not you'll get it. Psycho is a must see for all movie lovers out there. Splendid.

20 February 2006,As devastating today as ever!!!!,"When I began watching this movie I felt that a film from the year 1960 couldn't possibly have an effect on somebody who has seen all the major horror movies of the last 30 years or so. Exorcist, Omen, The Shining, Friday the 13th, etc. etc. etc. etc. Never have I watched a movie that layered such powerful emotional scenarios into digestible brain food that nourishes the darkest places of my psyche. . As the movie went on I felt Norman Bates' madness slowly bubble and build so exquisitely that it was indeed a guilty pleasure to witness his final all out blitzkrieg into sheer madness. At this breaking point it was I too who had lived the moment with all of the unfortunate guests of the Bates Motel. Oh I am not a psycho per SE, but after watching this movie I felt like I lived every experience in the first person. It was after the movie directly after the last scene that I realized that a movie this special had eluded my eyes for so long. I almost felt heartbroken because it would have been the horror/terror movie to judge all others. I recommend to any teenager getting into film to really watch this, perhaps alone, perhaps not. I am just floored by the powerful use of music and the absolute shock value. The psychological thriller was born from this film. I thought SEVEN was shocking, and to some degree it was. But I was shocked deep to my core after viewing this masterpiece. Nothing in film will shock me ever again, I truly believe this. This Hitchcock fellow was something special. It took me 30 years to see this, and its much more than just a shower scene. Thats only the beginning. Oh the classics. Lets not confuse Classic with Old like so many of us are so quick to do. This movie transcends Classic and is more modern than the stuff Hollywood is pushing out these days. Still shocking after 46 years.",10
14 June 2016,excellent performance,"An exceptional story line. the acting is also some of the best I've seen. I have recently watched the series Bates Motel which tells the story behind the motel in this original film. Also the mental state of Norman and his Mother whom has him completely under control, Norma. The role of Norman Bates was successfully filled by the young Freddy Highmore, maybe this series could prompt a remake of the film? Anthony Perkins performance was outstanding as was Vera Miles whom played Lila Crane. I would most definitely recommend this film to anyone to likes mentally stimulating film. It keeps ypu on your toes and the edge of your seat.

6 July 2016,The Best Picture of Hitchcock,"Of all the films Alfred Hitchcock is the most famous, the scariest, the most unexpired, the most innovative and unique, despite countless attempts to reproduce this success. However, during the life of the Maestro, no one dared to direct the sequel, and only in 80-e years have appeared three ""Psychosis"" and ""Psycho III"" was shot by actor Anthony Perkins, who almost all his life became a kind of hostage to his role of serial killer Norman Bates. But thousands of all kinds of thrillers, chillers, suspension, shockers and other newly formed genres, efforts were made to intimidate the audience with what Hitchcock techniques. It would seem that ""Psychosis"" was to suffer the fate of some outstanding paintings pilfered, that is, on HR and even angles. The halo of glory around masterpieces often makes overly picky to determine their real incorruptibility. But ""Psychosis"" still draws from the first seconds, holds incredible tension and scares to shiver. Alfred Hitchcock was sensitive to the internal mechanism of the creation of fear and like an experienced psychiatrist, he knew of a secret nerve endings, touching whom are able to bring a state of uncontrolled psychosis, a genuine nightmare. Unlike many imitators, the ""master of fear knew that fear breeds deep within us and not outside. The Director forces us to be afraid primarily of their own assumptions, conjecture, foreboding, happening fancy, just designing myself a terrible starting situation. The viewer inevitably identifies himself with a young Secretary Marion crane, caught by night in a secluded Motel. His owner Norman Bates has a secret, which unravels along with the heroine, who is in double danger, as her on suspicion of stealing money from the Bank is wanted by the police. And it is precisely the nightmare that is hidden in everyday reality, psychosis seemingly normal world — that is the main thing, the fear of the people in the tapes of Hitchcock.

In the ""Psychosis"" this feeling pushed to the limit, to the border territory, beyond which is the abyss of madness. And, accordingly, honed to perfection all cinematic techniques, means of artistic expression: from the brilliant to the oppressive music of Bernard Herrmann. The genuine innovations in which formal search is always meaningful, ""tied up"" in the story and accurately understood, still continue to strongly influence several decades later. And in the movie, as in most technical form of art, famous works, and especially, with innovative refinements, saved even harder. This film is still an absolute masterpiece of cinematic professionalism, skillful involvement of spectators in the game of fear. Incidentally, he was also among the most cash in the long career of Hitchcock (budget of $0.8 million was surpassed at the box office in forty times!), and the picture looked in the USA, over fifty million viewers.",10

15 February 2014,Brilliant and suspense lasts till the very end.,"Unlike the thriller movies of today, this movie is different. It isn't one of those movies with the obvious ending. The suspense will keep you waiting till the very end. The ending will make your jaw drop it is that brilliant, you will watch it again and again.

If you are one of those people against black and white movies, thinking they are 'too old', give this movie a try because you would never guess what is going to happen and you will talk about it forever. Everything about this movie has been performed to it's best and the ending will leave you rendered speechless.

My favorite horror movie of all time, it is definitely worth a watch.

30 November 2013,Classic Horror!,"An excellent classic horror flick. Hitchcock raised the bar for all horror movies without showing any blood, guts or nudity. A trailblazer for his time indeed. Hitchcock deliberately wanted ""Psycho"" to look like a cheap exploitation film. . . That is the mystery of why Hitchcock marred the ending of a masterpiece with a sequence that is grotesquely out of place. Whenever anyone speaks about Psycho, the first images that come to mind are those of Janet Leigh being hacked to death in the shower. The scene is so famous that even people who have not seen the movie are aware of it. Bernard Herrmann's strident, discordant music has been used in countless other movies to denote the appearance of a ""psycho."" The brilliance of the scene lies in the editing. Those who go frame-by-frame through it will note how much is left to the imagination. We see a knife, blood (actually chocolate syrup), water, and a woman's naked body (with certain parts strategically concealed from the camera), but only briefly is the penetration of the blade into the flesh shown*. The full horror of the murder is only hinted at on-screen. It takes the power of the viewer's imagination to fill in the blanks. Brilliant movie indeed.",10
14 March 2015,Great pic,"Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a woman who is in love with a divorced man Sam Loomis. He says once he pays his ex wife off with the alimony, they'll get married. When Marion's boss asks her to put their most valued client's money, $40,000 to be exact, and bring it to the bank. She has other plans though, she takes the money for herself and flee's the city, but not before her boss sees her driving off. Shaky enough, huh? But she pulls over to get a nap in, and a police officer asks if she's OK, but she gets shaky and just wants to drive off. The policemen fallows her since she is so shaky and she ends up buying a different car. She gets caught in a giant rainstorm and pulls over to the Bates Motel.

She meets there, the owner, a pleasant and polite young man, Norman Bates. He lives in the house next to the motel with his mother. Marion checks in and Norman offers her dinner, they have a conversation mostly about his mom and Marion is concerned when she heard screams from the house that sounded like his mom. Norman gets on the defenses and asks Marion some questions as well, she says she is going to a ""private island"". Norman is very attracted to her, you can tell immediately, and she leaves knowing that she has to get out of the trap she set for herself back in Phoenix. As she's taking a shower before bed, a mysterious figure comes to the curtain and opens it stabbing Marion violently several times causing her to die. Norman cleans up the mess and gets rid of her body not knowing about her money and throwing that away too.",8
28 July 2016,Psycho 1960,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:

a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",10

10 June 2016,Masterpiece,"One of the most important films in cinema history. Alfred Hitchcock directs not only a masterpiece of the thriller/horror genre , but also of the whole world cinema.

All the actors in this film are excellent. Janeth Leigh is wonderful in her role. She is one of the most brilliant actresses who have worked with Alfred Hitchcock. In this film Anthony Perkins succeeds in being resounding, but also disturbing. Vera Miles and all the others secondary actors make great performances.

This film is also helped by Bernard Hermann's score, that makes the shower scene immortal. But in this film the protagonist is Hitchcok's direction,that succeeds in scaring and disturbing all the audience, in all times.

21 July 2016,The best movie of suspense,"To me Psicosis, is one of the best suspense movies i have ever seen, along with the fear factor that comes with it. No doubt, Alfred Hitchcock is still known as the master of suspense. Also the Music and the sound effects makes you to stay awake and focus on every movement that the actors do. What a great job either Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh did in this film which was nominated to several categories at the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. Psicosis has become a cult movie and the fact it is a black and white movie, it makes us to use our imagination in every detail of the movie. So we can picture our own colors at Psicosis. To conclude, I would say this a piece of art, this movie needs to be shown to everyone, from new cinema students, actors and those who love directing suspense movies.

b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.

c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.

d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.

e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".

f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.

g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.

In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",9

18 February 2019,Av Productions,"The movie caught my eye as we watched it but the movie in itself was outstanding. All the scary scenes,were not jumpscares like they are now. No they were more than that. Alfred Hitchcock used psychology, which i think hints the title. He uses your own imagination against you, getting into your brain and playing with your emotions. He lets your imagination run wild before he shows who was doing all these horrific things. He played the system on this one i think, knowing back then the hays code back then was just terrible. Some parts of the movie he will have you thinking and another part he will have you shaking in your boots. Back to the hays code part of this, you have to admit he did slip through the cracks a bit on this one. The code was extremely strict back then not letting homicide,suicide or even nudity be shown back then. He did not put any in there explicitly letting it be shown. Yet he did let you know what was going on in obvious ways , such as showing blood running down a drain and other things of that nature. This movie was outstanding in my opinion . Every dark vs light aspect was just right showing characters in dark clothing to be evil or crooked, and lighter colored characters to be loving and good. Even the small things like the Mcguffin he got just right in my opinion , you didn't know the importance of it until he wanted you to and that was the crazy thing about this movie, i think every actor and actress played their parts very well. Not letting the plot of the story get tangled and brought off course at all, i think this is one of the best if not the best movie of the early years of films.
