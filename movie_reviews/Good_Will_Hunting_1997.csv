17 March 1999,"A slow burner, a fine achievement","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10
13 October 2011,Incredible,"I don't think I have been this moved by a movie in a while. Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.

Good Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.

The acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best ""drama"" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.

All in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10
3 September 2008,The Genius In Our Midst,"So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor.

Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.

When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.

Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.

Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.

Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.

Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.

I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.

He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.

Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us.

I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent.",10
21 January 2001,This movie has a brilliant script...,"It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER.",10
27 February 2018,Its central performances are phenomenal and its inevitable emotional release is truly powerful.,"The genius of 'Good Will Hunting (1997)' isn't in its plotting or its resolution or even its character arcs per say (which are all a little formulaic or clich√©d to an extent), but rather in the nuanced and realistic journey that that these almost fully-formed people take to reach the conclusions you know they eventually will. The two central performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Williams' subtly wise and humorous demeanour exudes fatherly knowledge as a man of experience and Damon's frustratingly yet understandably closed-off defensiveness makes his inevitable emotional release truly powerful. The writing rounds them off in ways which make them feel honest, imperfect and, most importantly, real. 8/10

22 June 2017,Beautiful,"I return to this movie from time to time for the last two decades. I do not like Damon and Affleck, but this is their lifetime achievement and the most deserved Oscar they will ever win. Beautiful drama about finding yourself, finding a balance between the essence of life and its everyday appearance, about love and friendship. Realistic, unpretentiously philosophical and warm movie about life. Two main trumps of this movie are its perfect script and brilliant Robin Williams, the actor that adds warmth and love in everything he does. I can not say it's a masterpiece of cinematography, but it surely is beautiful, intelligent and it never gets old.

18 June 2000,The Real Best Picture of 1997,"While everyone took sides with L.A. Confidential (for it's Old Hollywood flair and tight-as-a-girdle plot arc) or Titanic (for it's generally inescapable, juggernaut-like aura) as the Best Picture of 1997, it seems that too many people overlook Good Will Hunting for what it was: a timeless little opus that managed to make South Boston look romantic and happened to make Ben Affleck and Matt Damon some of the most deserving superstars in recent memory.

Because before they were anybody, they were just the writers of this tale of a reluctant human being named Will Hunting, a mathematical genius who wore the guise of a hoodlum, and all of the sudden obstacles he had to take on to truly step in to manhood. Among these obstacles were a straight-forward shrink who outright dared Will to bulls*** him (played by Robin Williams, who got his overdue Oscar for it), a brilliant M.I.T. professor who felt it his own personal redemption to put Will's mind to great use somehow (Stellan Skarsg√•rd, who never fails to steal nearly every scene he's in), and a girl who doesn't understand why the boy she loves so much cannot love her.

It was these obstacles that made Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships). His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching.",
25 June 2000,Two Pals Make Good in Hollywood,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script. The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way. Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.

What ""Hunting"" essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity. What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure. This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing. The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating. Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck ""paid their dues"" -- and success did not just fall into their laps. These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality.

""Good Will Hunting"" is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the creativity of Damon and Affleck.",8
28 December 2016,"A Sensitive, Remarkable Look at Genius","Matt Damon's Will Hunting couldn't be more complex. He is an utter genius. Unfortunately, he has enough baggage to send him around the world. Will is a brilliant mathematician, smarter than many of the professors at MIT. However, he is depressed and self destructive. He gives up the minute things get hard. He can't relate to others, especially women. After many failures to help him, he hooks up with a man who respects him (but who also fears his insights) played by Robin Williams in one of his finer dramatic roles. He pushes Will and Will pushes back. The interaction between two imperfect, but brilliant, human beings is the core of this movie. Created by Damon and Ben Affleck, this was probably the best movie of the year. Will Hunting is searching for happiness, as are we all, but others have decided what that happiness looks like. He is indeed ""hunting"" for joy in his life. Excellent performances all around.

26 May 2022,Good Will Hunting Review,"Will Hunting a janitor at M. I. T has a gift for learning, but his genius is going to waste because he can't seem to find his purpose in life.

Back in 2019 I had went to Boston to see the Celtics and the Bruins, and the hotel I was staying at had a pillow with ""wicked smaht"" stitched on to it. I remember my dad seeing it and immediately saying the iconic line ""my boys wicked smaht"", and I asked him what that was from. He told me it was from a classic movie called Good Will Hunting that takes place in Boston. So, with my curiosity peaked I returned home and watched it for the first time. Since then I have seen this film 5 times and it has become one of my all time favourite films.

From top to bottom this film is perfection. Matt Damon and Robin Williams give what I considered the best performances of their careers, along with two very strong performances from Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard. The writing is incredible and the dialogue in particular is phenomenal. The cinematography and direction by Gus Can Sant is perfect throughout the entire film, and the music to accompany it is beautiful.

What makes this film for me is that it is something we can all relate to. This film is about finding yourself and finding a purpose for your life, everyone on the planet at one point or another needed to seriously consider the question ""who am I"". That for me is an extremely powerful message and why this film is so great.

10/10 A+",10
21 January 2019,Thought provoking classic,"One of the movies which turned Robin Williams into a legend! He proved in this movie that he is as good in his dramatic roles as in his comedic routines. Pair that with a great performance from Matt Damon as the tittle character and an inspiring story built upon the everyday struggle of the characters and you got yourself a 90's cinematic classic.

7 May 2022,A Great Script And Fine Acting,"This is the film that put Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on the map, winning them an Oscar for their screenplay. It's a wonderful script about a young man with extraordinary talents whose rough upbringing undermines his opportunities.

Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a polymath with an eidetic memory who works as a custodian at MIT. He lives by both his wits and his fists. Minnie Driver plays Skylar, the university student who falls for the brash young man. And Robin Williams, in an Oscar-winning performance, plays Sean, the community college instructor who dares to confront Will's demons. All three are tremendous.

Damon and Affleck know Boston and they imbue the story with blue-collar authenticity. The film understands the anti-intellectualism of some of its characters (compare ""Breaking Away"") but also celebrates the upper limits of scholarship and prodigious abilities. Will is actually an anti-intellectual intellectual.

This is one of the best films of its decade. There, I said it. How do you like them apples?",10

23 August 2020,exceptional,"A film growing up in yourself. It is so simple to say about it be great, admirable, profound touching or remarkable. But ,in obvious manner, it is more than a film. The reasons are many and few from them are only emotions. A beautiful script as the impressive job of two young actors, A magnificent Robin Williams and a seductive end. At the first sigh, a film in which you recognize yourself. But it is more, nuanced, precise and inspired portrait of potential, help, life meaning , love and the most profound truth defining yourself and your world.

19 October 2019,Ranked 87th on the site though it is better than at least 1/3 of films rated higher on here,"I watched this movie for the third time today and it was just as powerful to me, if not more so, than when I saw it upon its release.

Gripping story and characters.

Superb acting all-around.

Robin Williams earned every ounce of his Oscar and his grand performance here is one of the great efforts in movie history. It's one of those roles that should be replayed every year at the Oscars ceremony along with Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca and Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain. Williams is not the lead actor but his interplay with Matt Damon in the key scene near the finale is one of the best film history has to offer us.

As most should know, Damon wrote the script with a young Ben Affleck. Affleck's younger brother Casey has a solid supporting role as well. Cole Hauser, who acted with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in the 1992 film School Ties, has a small role but makes an impression. Hauser also acted with Ben Affleck in Dazed and Confused (1993) and I assume must be a real-life friend of both.

Minnie Driver is really great in a difficult role.

I have a small problem with a couple of the lines (particularly the bar scene) which I won't give away but it knocks the movie down a half point. Some parts of the story are just not believable. There is some tongue and cheek humor and a few things that might seem implausible today but were realistic in 1997.

The brilliance of the writing, the youthful energy and the power of the performances (along with a great soundtrack that features the haunting songs of the late Elliott Smith) make this a landmark film for a generation - especially those who came of age in the 1990's.",9

23 October 2017,A Movie About Men: The Internal Fight Club,"Why another review? Well, for the few that might read this, I find this movie very accurate about the state of seeing a counselor. It is also very accurate about a man who carries deep toxic shame within keeping him from intimacy with others and living with massive defense mechanisms. Because of this, I understand why some do not like this movie, it taps a part of themselves they are still running from, and that is why this movie is so powerful.

It is very hard to believe two 25yos wrote this script with such realistic relational depth. There are some very powerful emotional dynamics in this movie--the scene with Will & Skyler in her apartment when Will unpacks. The monumental scene with Will and Sean ""It's not your fault""--when a movie is a template for real life, this is an epic work of art! This movie allowed people to talk and relate when emotions were road blocks, to point to a scene in Good Will Hunting to establish a base for communication.

Here's a point in real time. I was writing this review and a friend called. He ended up hanging up the phone on me because I questioned him about a project. He did a ""Will"" in Skyler's room on me because I tapped a dark shadow in his life. His sensitivity to being questioned is such a part of his identity he is unconscious about, but something that causes him great conflict in his marriage which is now a divorce, his inability to stay employed, and history with addiction.

This movie lays a template for men's issues!",10
19 March 2020,One of the best feel-good movies out there,"One of my favorite Robin Williams movies. Hits that certain feel-good spot that we all need every once in a while.

5 July 2019,Good but overrated and overhyped,"It's a good movie; the premise is its best point, as well as the human connection between friends and relationships, but so many reviews on here calling this a masterpiece or one of the best movies ever made are way unwarranted and over the top. It's a good low budget movie with some depth and a famous role for Robin WIlliams, who won the best supporting actor Oscar. The script is good, but not great, the directing is slightly above average, it drags at times, and some little aspects of it are unrealistic. It's definitely good and worth a watch, but it's not one of the greats of all time.

I just love story in this.

So funny and very tougtful too.

Amazing performances from Matt Damon, Robin Williams.

Other cast was good too.

So well crafted characters.

I liked romance aspect in this very much.

But conversations between Matt Damon's and Robin Williams are so good.

So therapeutic too.

I really thinked my own life too when i watched this movie.

I do relate with Will so much.

Yes i love science but i'm not any genius.

But do i really know anything about life at all?

Probably not.

I have read things how to love but have i really loved?

That's just one example how this movie hit me so hard.

19 August 2021,Exceptional film.,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10
3 March 2006,"Incredible, moving movie.","A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie, and I only hope to add a few more praises.

The fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me, I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script, but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.

Matt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.

Yes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.

The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.

If your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it's time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.

This one is a keeper in my movie library.",10
30 March 2021,Thoughtful Warm Film,"For the longest period of time I never understood the title of this film. Was it about someone on some Diogenes style quest? Or was was it about someone who scowers thrift stores? Well, it has nothing to do with good will or Goodwill, it's about a young man called Will Hunting. He's a(somewhat unrealistic)genius who can solve math problems that baffle the world's greatest minds and knows twice as much on any subject covered in a Harvard class...yet he works as a janitor. A professor at MIT stumbles across and sets him up with a therapist, who tries to counsel Will while drilling to the core of his problems.

The film might be centered around Matt Damon, who gives a deep performance, but Robin Williams claims every scene he's in and is the most memorable thing from this film. As you probably know, the picture also features Ben Affleck in a limited role, through which he still makes his talent evident. But while Damon, Affleck and William's may have been good choices Minnie Driver certainly wasn't. Who thought of her for the role or what they saw I'll never know.

The backstory behind the script is so well known that I won't bother going over it; all I will add is that Affleck and Damon didn't do to bad a job for a first time and recieved a merited Oscar for it.

Good Will Hunting is a thought provoking film and that's why so many enjoy it. It's a film that actually tried to be more than cheap entertainment and it succeeded.",8
12 September 2022,"In short, it's ace!","So great!

'Good Will Hunting' is a film I had heard many a great thing about but had never actually seen it so didn't know anything about the plot - so much so that I genuinely thought it was about the good will of hunting or something... and certainly not about a character named Will Hunting! The poster makes it look like a film of that sort, in my defence.

I also didn't realise, aside from the lead two, that the cast list was so stacked until the credits came up at the start. The names didn't let me down either, as the acting is superb across the board. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are truly outstanding together, I already rate them from other productions so I'm glad I can add another cracker to their respective filmographies.

Even away from Messrs Damon and Williams, you've got very good displays from the likes of Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Minnie Driver (emotionally, particularly, excellent) and Ben Affleck. Pretty impressive that it was written by both Affleck and Damon too!

The plot is great, the way the friendship builds between Will (Damon) and Sean (Williams) is so beautifully done. Both characters are very interesting, even if I didn't buy the genius of Will at all at first but I quickly let that go as the film does such a grand job at crafting everything together around it.

In short, it's ace! Glad I finally checked it out.",9
23 February 1999,"""Whatever blows your hair back"" - This movie does it for me!","This is the best movie I have seen since the Godfather. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make a great team...not only as actors, but more impressively as co-writers. Add Robin Williams in perhaps his best role ever (too close to Good Morning Vietnam for me to make the call), and you have a wonderfully entertaining movie.

Ben Affleck is convincing as the best friend to a genius, able to effectively play the joker and the friend who would ""lay down in traffic for you"". Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired (except maybe a beard trimmer...).

The most amazing thing about this movie is the writing. Even if the acting were not terrific, this movie still would have made my top ten list. I was captivated from beginning to end.

If you've not seen it, Good Will Hunting is without doubt a ""renter"", and I think after seeing it, it's one you'll want to own to watch again and again.",10
8 April 2022,good will hunting,"Let's compare GWH to the earlier, better ""Ordinary People"", shall we? Both are psychiatrist savior movies set in large, urban American communities that feature plenty of good acting and perceptive dialogue. So why is it then that I care deeply about Timothy Hutton's Conrad Jarrett in ""People"" and give not a cold Guinness about the title character of this film?

Maybe it's because in Redford's film it mattered very much to me that a suicidal and troubled youth with a messed up home life learns to survive in the world and not withdraw from it whereas in Gus Van Sant's film, (which is really Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's film...more about this later), it really doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever that Will would rather be a janitor than an MIT math whiz. If anything, Will's shrink, well played by Robin Williams, seems far more damaged than he is, what with anger issues over his dead wife and lack of success compared to Stellan Skarsgaard and all. Perhaps if the film had focused on him, and been called ""Sean Maguire Floundering"", it would have caused me to exhibit some empathy, but, then, if it had focused on how unstable the shrink was you would not have had the therapist as healer trope so beloved by Hollywood ever since Claude Raines sat down next to Bette Davis in ""Now, Voyager"".

I also did not particularly care for the lack of visual interest or flow in this film. It tended toward the closed in feel of ""prestige"" TV, like a Hallmark Hall of Fame with the F word, as Van Sant's camera continually retreats before the onslaught of Damon and Affleck's dialogue, with all the main characters afforded at least one long, self revealing monologue and Williams and Damon given more than one. And while the monologues are all intelligent and even at times funny they render the film more of a literary than a cinematic experience. Thus the Oscar win for best writing rather than best directing.

Give it a B minus.",7

10 November 2012,Goodish Will Hunting,"I'm aware of the significance of this movie in bringing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to prominence not only as actors but as screenwriters and watched it with a degree of expectation. However the story of Damon's rebellious, tortured working-class genius flowering in the rarefied hot-house atmosphere of Boston's Harvard University didn't quite engage me, despite some good acting.

The story is implausible in the extreme, as Damon's gifted character shyly but deliberately puts himself forward to get noticed by answering a difficult mathematical problem on display in the halls of the university and then follows his difficult progress to self- awareness which he ultimately achieves through encountering burn-out been there-done that psychologist Robin Williams and a pretty but feisty Anglophile student, played by Minnie Driver.

I was entertained by the movie but felt its mix of low comedy (profanity is frequent, especially when Damon gets down with his gang of fellow low-lifes which includes best mate Chuckie, played by Affleck) with heightened psychological drama didn't always convince. Naturally, Damon gets off to a frosty start with last-resort Willams and even more naturally they open up to each other before the tears really flow in one of the movie's well signposted climaxes further down the line. Ditto the obvious conclusion too when Damon finally lets his heart rule his head.

It's well acted although at times it seems pretty stagy, with lots of male-bonding and man- hugs on board. Damon is believable as the gifted misfit but overdoes the angst at times. I didn't quite get Affleck as the goofy sidekick and got the impression he was cast for the part because he wrote it. Williams is good as the broken-down professor but his winsomeness and adoration of his deceased wife grate a bit by the end, Spencer Tracy he's not and while Driver is okay in her part, I didn't really feel the attraction between her and Damon..

In the end, while the film engaged me enough, it did seem to me somewhat overrated and didn't quite take me fully on Will's journey to rehabilitation and spiritual redemption.",5
13 April 2019,Wow,"Rarely do I enjoy a film so much that I relish watching all the way through the end credits, which in this case are superimposed on a long take of Will's car driving down the highway with pop tunes playing (now ""oldies"" like ""Afternoon Delight""). Just seeing this classic for the first time after being a long time fan of Damon & Affleck (who wrote the screenplay!), and R. Williams having tragically passed, somehow made it even more excellent. This is masterfully presented, powerfully engaging entertainment. If you have any tears in you this movie will bring them out when it gets a hold of your emotions. If it doesn't, all I can say is it's your fault.

30 October 2016,Robin William's is great. The rest of the film is average,"'Good Will Hunting' is a film of two halves for me. There's loads of fairly uninteresting 'buddy scenes' between Damon and Affleck, and any scene involving Minnie Driver's character is a write off, but in the middle of all of that dross is an amazing performance from the late, great Robin Williams.

His scenes with Matt Damon are so good. In fact if you could go on You Tube and watch only those bits I'd suggest it. Williams remains the warm and funny legend that we've seen in his comedies, but here he is also slightly more guarded and restrained. The poetry of the dialogue and his delivery all match up to make for some lovely moments.

It's just a shame that they appear in an uneven film, that is F-bomb heavy and at times slow.

18 September 2022,Lived up to the hype!!,"I heard about this film for YEARSSSS!!!l and I've always wondered what the hype is about and why so many people have talked about it all these years. I have to say now that I have finally seen it, I can see why. The film is beautiful in so many ways, the characters and their stories, the cinematography, the character development, the relationships between the characters, and makes you think about your own life, your own potential, your own achievements and what you want from life. The case was beyond impeccable and everyone played their roles superbly. I loved everything from the script to the setting, and I couldn't recommend this film enough. Definitely a classic!!!

20 October 2002,"Quite good, except for a bogus ending","Barbed script full of ""F--- you's"" doesn't seem like a likely candidate for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar, but this one did win and I think the performances are the reason. The acting here is so strong--particularly by Matt Damon, who co-wrote the thing--that I believe it makes the writing seem better than it is. There are some terrible sequences that can be blamed on the script, direction and editing, such as the bit where Damon's friend Ben Affleck substitutes for him at a job interview. However, the acting usually rescues it, with Oscar-winner Robin Williams pensive and endearing as a psychologist who becomes therapist and mentor to closet-genius Damon. Minnie Driver is also excellent as an unlikely love-interest for Matt, but the finale is almost too hokey to believe. In their efforts to tie this all up with a big satin bow, novice writers Damon and Affleck sink their modest little ship just as it's about to dock. Too bad. **1/2 from ****

12 November 2014,The Best Thing Kevin Smith Ever Touched,"Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor at M.I.T., has a gift for mathematics, but needs help from a psychologist (Robin Williams) to find direction in his life.

What do we have here? An early acting job for Casey Affleck, produced by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier (the best thing they have ever touched), with a score from Danny Elfman. That score is something else, because it is not one that Elfman is usually associated with, being much more subtle than his typical work.

Is this Matt Damon's best role? Most likely. Robin Williams' best role? Quite possibly. Ben Affleck's best role? Maybe even that. This film just sort of brought the best out of everyone involved, and is entertaining to boot.

23 March 2004,It`s Not Good,"What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedly

First off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15

Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?

But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied here

There are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in life

But I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing",4
21 January 2019,The genius in the crowd,"I have to admit that I rarely had been moved or deeply touched by a movie, but GOOD WILL HUNTING is one of the few movies that has this power. And it truly deserved all the Oscars it won 21 years ago.

GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very well made movie that has many great things going for it. Gus Van Sant's direction is near perfect, and the outdoor sets are all nice to look at. The script is very intelligent and thought provoking, and the soundtrack, while not important, is also good.

But the real strongpoint of GOOD WILL HUNTING is the cast and their performances: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had never been better, although they won the Academy Award for best screenplay. Stellan Skarsgard is also great as the Maths professor at University. Minnie Driver (Hunting's girlfriend) is also adorable and believable. And Robin Williams deserves a very special mention, because he not only gives a very strong performance, but he also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (the only Academy Award in his long career). And his character is very endearing as well.

In substance, one of the greatest movies from the 1990s and a movie that still stands the test of time. 10/10",10
13 October 2020,Contrived & Irrelevant...,"I'm not sure why Matt Damon's character has to be a genius, I don't buy the story that he presents, a character who is under privileged but with an acute and intelligent mind, a higher than average IQ would have been a lot more plausible, relatable, realistic and recognisable. The pauper genius is just fairy tale nonsense. In fact, the more you delve into these shallows, the only element that remains anchored and of value is the toned down Dead Poets character that Robin Williams reprises and the universal message he promotes. If superficial fairy tales are your thing great but I usually consume Disney for that kind of mush.

10 December 2019,"""That boy is wicked smaht.""","If there is any film that you can call ""perfect"" it's this one.

SYNOPSIS: Will Hunting (Matt Damon) seems to have everything you'd want from unparalleled intelligence to incredibly loyal friends to the most loving girlfriend, but even with all of this Will still keeps a wall between him and everything he cares about. A life that would appear to be so simple, is in fact a lot more complex than it seems.

DIRECTION: Gus Van Sant directs this thing to near perfection. Through his direction there is so much life and grounding added to a story that otherwise seems quite plain. Knowing at which points to change the focus of the camera from one character to the next. Knowing when to hold a close up to really cease a beautiful scene and capture the expression. Now, I'm not going to sit here and act like no one else could've directed this film, however, a film like this could've easily been ruined by poor directing and editing. Great work.

WRITING: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really knocked this one out of the park. Not only was both of their acting on-point, but the dialogue in the film is so pure. There are so many memorable moments in this film just from incredible dialogue. It feels as if there's not a single line in this film that goes unnoticed or should be cut. If the heart could write a script I'm pretty sure this screenplay is what would be the result. This film definitely deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar that it won.

ACTING: It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I swear Robin Williams had me screaming ""I KNOW, SEAN!"" followed by aggressive tears from the guilt I felt that I never actually had a reason to feel, but damn you Robin Williams. On top of that, Matt Damon, how dare you memorize ridiculously intellectual monologues like the one at the Harvard Bar scene and the one that cut from you being at a job interview with the CIA or whoever to you being seated in Sean's office. I'm starting to feel this is an autobiography. Are those just books? I don't know. Shut up. Then moving on the Ben Affleck who is my dream best friend. One I can confide in and a man who will willingly go to my job interviews in an over-dramatic BAHSTON accent acting as a pretentious. Yes, please! Minnie Driver. That heartbreaking scene over the phone... ""I love you."" Say it back... SAY IT BACK, WILL! What a killer Irish accent by the way. Not an Irish bone in my body, but trust me... killed that accent. Stellan Skarsgard, I understand how much you care for him Stellan, but he doesn't want to be a damn mathematician. Do you know how easy it is for him?! DO YOU? And Casey Affleck, stop worrying about your damn double burger. I do have to acknowledge how resourceful you were with that baseball glove though. *Tips the hat* I realize I just pretty much reiterated lines from the film, but the acting is so damn good that I don't even know what else to say. It's so amazing. I will say this film does possibly have the worst performance of anyone ever, however. Professor Lambeau's assistant. He looked and sounded like he was continuously trying to put himself asleep during every scene he's in.

CONCLUSION: This is my favorite film of all time. Though the directing is anything to go crazy about, the writing and the acting in this film, elevates this film to an entire different dimension for me. I can watch this film on repeat 24 hours a day. Actually, make that like 16. Sleep is essential to get another productive 16 hours of Good Will Hunting. That's my review.",10
7 May 2002,One of the best films of 1997,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck shine in a film full of shining moments. There seemed to be very little wrong with this film, and it is a shame the Oscar committee decided to pass on this film as the best of 1997. Not only were Will and Chuckie endearing characters, every one else in the film conveyed a smooth and natural performance. Even Minnie Driver proved she could fit in her role as Skylar. This film also introduced me to Stellan Skaarsgard, who I think is a very underated actor. A great follow-up of `To Die For' from director Gus Van Zant.

25 May 2000,Snark Hunting,"I admire films that shoot high and miss. But it really rankles me when a film pretends to shoot high, avoids doing so because of lack of talent, and lies to us in the process.

There's great drama in the mere existence of an idiot savant. These are people who often are intolerable socially, inadequate in common thinking skills, and generally lead a cursed `elephantman' life, except for their celebration as (in this case) mathematicians. Instead, we're given a watered down likeable homeboy who has been abused. Oh and he has a photographic memory which is a separate pathology (the two never coincide). Depth discarded.

There's truly deep drama in the mathematical problems good Will would be dealing with. But this would require a Nabokov, and his mastery of metaphor. Instead we get the koolaid version for dummies in some (as it turns out) meaningless scribbles and a bubble diagram. Depth is twice discarded. Believe me, this could be played up big; the power of a christ in some of the insights that are speculated -- the voice and eye of God.

There's also common, but good drama in the dedicating of one's life to their gift at great personal sacrifice. We actually have some good films in this regard concerning musicians. Math is better since you don't even get the applause. Here the guy with the insights but lack of language would be codependent martyr with the expert in the formalisms but no vision. But too hard, so pass.

I can attest that there are cinematic depths to be mined at NSA, MIT, even Southie in terms of the absolutely unique and strange feel of the places. How could this film have missed those dark assets and end up so totally without atmosphere?

This movie got made for one reason only: Robin Williams saw a part for himself. Therefore, the previously described ignorances are filled by an amplified backstory so Williams can find himself after losing his wife. Pretty damned offensive given the possibilities. I predict that someone will do this story (or something like it) well sometime before I die. It's just too rich, and we do have some bright minds available. Its just not these two kids.",
20 July 2013,Pretentious and Manipulative,"A math genius works as a janitor at MIT, unable to overcome his difficult upbringing. The premise of this film is ludicrous. It really requires suspension of belief to buy that Damon, who never attended college, has become a genius by reading books. The pretentious and manipulative script by Damon and Afleck really reaches: not only can he do complex math problems, but he can hold his own with anyone when discussing politics, philosophy, economics, literature, and history. We are supposed to root for Damon, but he's such an arrogant jerk that one roots for someone to punch him out. Williams is fine as a psychologist, but it's a role he has played a number of times. Driver does well as Damon's needy girlfriend.

27 December 1998,Solid.,"Good Will Hunting is a very solid and quiet film. I just finished watching it for the second time on DVD and was more impressed by the screenplay than I was the first time. I thought the first time I saw the film it was only Van Sant's direction that held it all together. The movie is just well written and well directed. I think the casting was good, although I don't think Ben Affleck does a very god job in this film. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, although a big part of me still thinks it belonged to Robert Forster for Jackie Brown. Matt Damon is very good in the lead role. I particularly like the scene toward the end when Matt and Robin's character's open up. The emotion is overwhelming and that is some great acting. The rest of the cast is good too, and Gus Van Sant's direction is powerful. Great movie.

It brings, heart, good (and bad) nature, and many other things in this tale of a janitor at MIT who is terrific at math. This man Will Hunting (played remarkably by Matt Damon) has many flaws though, and soon, he meets his match- Sean, a psychologist (Robin Williams gives a well deserved Oscar winning performance here) and little by little, starts to change. The way the film shows us Will , Sean and the supporting characters is spectacular and nothing is funnier than a Boston accent. Great all around.

11 May 2022,"Deep, beautiful and inspirational.","This movie took me on a ride that I did not think it will take me on. All the things and elements that affect character really act as a unique part of movie. Plot is pretty interesting and was one of a kind the time it came.

Actors were wonderful and without a doubt direction seemed amazing.

4 April 2020,Beautiful Film About Emotional Intelligence,"Intelligence isn't how many books you can read or if you have a degree. Accurate intelligence is about how self-aware you are with your intuition and how loving you are to yourself and existence. Therefore, if your behaviour isn't changing, then you're not growing. Some people are so focused on technical knowledge but lack the big picture, and because of this, they're emotionally unstable and stuck in life. You can have all the technical expertise, you can be an expert in your professional field but have no idea of the big picture.

16 March 2004,"To tell the truth, I thought it was boring","I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surpised. Even though, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I dispise math. Maybe I'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. Even though I loved ""American Beauty"", but that was it. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If I'm missing something in this movie, please E-mail me. I am curious why this is on the top 250. And don't say ""Because it was a good movie"".

28 January 2018,Amazing,"Surprised to see so many people disliked this one. Personally, as a guy who just enjoys watching a movie, this is exactly what I like to see. I couldn't care less if it's unrealistic or if the plot is obvious and you can guess the ending about an hour before it happens. This is a masterpiece, at least in my tiny and unimpressive brain.

30 June 2010,Unbearable !,"10 years ago I've watched it. And it gave me only pain ever since. Pure and clear, I hate this movie. Rather, what's here to love?! Let me tell you, the moment when (Robin Williams) was talking about his wife who farted till she waked herself up, the joke of the girl in the caf√© about old people's sexual perversity, the stupid never-ending lecture about genius guys (which seems copied, as it is, from many books), all of that are little instances for how disgusting and boring this movie is. Actually, this is what lived from it with the poor me. And when it comes to its cast, then let me bleed with hate; (Ben Affleck) is underrated actor, he is, since he isn't hated enough! I just can't stand (Minnie Driver) as an actress. And (Matt Damon) is so cold and unconvincing in mostly all what he does. There is a good story there, but totally murdered by adolescent script and provocatively mute direction. Nothing is beautiful in this movie. And while it's supposed to be touchy, it totally isn't. Save the scene of (Affleck) talking about missing his friend, I didn't enjoy anything. Enough to say that after its ending, I blamed myself hardly for setting all through it, and after 10 years I still do. Without further ado, and to be incredibly objective; THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR ME.",1
30 April 2021,"If you don't get emotional when watching the movie, you're crazy.","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Such an emotional, amazing performance by Matt Damon, Robin Williams and Ben Affleck among others. The story follows a young Will Hunting, a self-taught genius in mathematics and others. However, Will is poor and cannot afford to go to University, so he instead he works as a janitor at MIT. One day, Will cracks a math problem and his genius is discovered by the mathematics professor, Gerald Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsg√•rd. Unfortunately, Will gets arrested for assaulting a police officer but then makes a deal with Lambeau and has to go to court mandated therapy while studying mathematics. Will also meets a young girl named Skyler who he starts dating. While in therapy, Will meets the therapist Dr. Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams, who helps Will change his perspective on his life.

If you love an emotional drama, which will definitely make you cry (or at least feel something), this is the movie for you! By far one of the best performances I've seen by loving Robin Williams and young Matt Damon.",10
8 January 2007,Robin Williams Stole Burt Reynolds Oscar!!,"This awful movie made a lot of money, but that doesn't mean it was good, as a matter of fact it was excruciating. Yet another over rated movie that was simply painful and boring to watch. This story is so preposterous, poorly acted it makes me crazy. This is an insult to cinema goers,with Robin Williams playing the same character he did in Dead Poets Society, Awakenings and Patch Adams and for that alone it is just plain despicable.

No other film was as clich√©d and pathetic as this was. I cannot remember a film so pointless and laughable as this dreadful movie was. In a year of so many horrible films, this was the worst excuse for a film I can think of. This film was so torturous I cannot put it into words. I detested every second. I am mad that I wasted my life by seeing this idiotic film. That is when you know a movie is bad.

And to top it off Robin Williams Stole Burt Reynolds Oscar (Boogie Nights)

6 August 1998,"No, Bad","I don't understand the hoopla for this movie. It was all right, a couple of good moments, but it didn't add up to anything, and I completely forgot the entire experience ten minutes after I was outside the theatre. Anyone who doesn't like a lot of swearing should stay away, too. I swear at times, too, but not like these people. For the most part, an unpleasant time.

28 May 2008,How you like dem apples?,"Did Matt Damon & Ben Affleck really write this?? No way!! I am shocked to see such a layered and deep story come from two young actors.

I'm sure there is nothing that I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep it simple.

The movie was tremendous. I give the two youngsters their kudos. This was a very emotionally charged drama with the main characters, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) & Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), being very complex and embattled.

Both Damon and Williams did an excellent job, for which Williams was rewarded.

21 August 2017,An Emotionally Disturbed Mathmatical Genius from South Boston,"This movie begins with an incredibly gifted young man named ""Will Hunting"" (Matt Damon) working as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The problem with him is that he is extremely anti-social and is constantly getting into trouble with the law. Then one day he sees an incredibly difficult mathematical formula posted on a bulletin board there at the university and he writes the solution on it without any difficulty. Needless to say, the professor who put the problem on the bulletin board named ""Gerald Lambeau"" (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) is totally amazed and immediately sets out to find the person responsible. However, when he finds Will he is totally unprepared for the emotional wreck in front of him. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I really enjoyed the performance of Matt Damon, Robin Williams (as the psychologist ""Dr. Sean Maguire"") and to a lesser extent that of Ben Affleck (as Will's loyal friend ""Chuckie""). On that note, I should probably mention that Matt Damon won an Oscar for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" while both Robin Williams and Minnie Driver (as Will's girlfriend ""Skylar"") were each nominated for an Oscar as well. Be that as it may, although the film has some slow scenes here and there, it has a quality soundtrack and enough good drama and comedy to entertain nicely enough, and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7
13 January 2023,Robin Williams steals the show,"It's taken me 25 years to finally get around to seeing this film. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have both become huge stars. And Robin Williams has tragically left us. As time has passed, different aspects of the film become more noticeable.

Without a doubt, it is Robin Williams that makes this film special. The almost bottomless empathy he brings to the role of Sean connects directly to the audience's emotions.

Minnie Driver is also excellent as the ""love interest"", Skylar. She brings energy, heart and believability to a film that is otherwise quite downtempo.

The script - famously co-written by Damon and Affleck - is good, and particularly effective when characters are exploring their vulnerabilities.

But there are weaknesses. Damon's Will is one-dimensional, and moving beyond his petulance seems to be a switch that gets flipped, rather than any kind of character development. It doesn't help that he is rather unlikeable - certainly not as likeable as Williams' and Drivers' care for him suggests.

Affleck and the rest of the ""salt of the earth"" Boston friends are also unbelievable. This is a student's view of a townie, where drinking and fighting and swearing and repairing cars is all they are capable of doing.

Without Williams and Driver, this could have been a very disappointing film. But despite it flaws, and thanks to sympathetic direction from Gus van Sant, it still manages to tug on the heartstrings.",8
4 January 2002,Entertaining piece of sentimental Hollywood tosh,"A rags to riches story where a working class boy is a mathematical genius who prefers a working class existence of bar rooms, fights and ball games to an academic life. However when he is discovered by a professor at a trial for public disorder he is released into his care to have tuition and therapy. Sean Maguire is brought in for the therapy while Will and his friend Chuckie go on with their normal lives.

This is a quite hyped film (the rise of scriptwriters Damon and Affleck was already along the way before this hit - there's is not quite a rags to riches story for them), however there is much to enjoy here. The story never fully explains how Will came to develop his talent or even how he came to know about it - was he born knowing everything about maths? You feel that Will could have been given a little less arrogance - nobody knows everything. However the story is quite interesting and it's given such a fairytale gloss that details are not important.

The script also gives Williams a chance to do yet another tear-jerker role and get an Oscar for his troubles. Affleck and Driver are also good in support but Damon is the lead. His character has layers and he does have plenty of good scenes, but the main problem is that his arrogance is not shown as a negative trait and it tends to make him a little unsympathetic.

Overall a good piece of Hollywood fairy tale gloss that does what it has to do - not a classic but it's a nice bit of sentimental tosh.",
16 August 2014,Unbelievably overrated.,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",
28 April 2003,James Dean buys a pocket calculator.,"A rebellious young college janitor (Matt Damon) is secretly a maths genius, but even when it is uncovered, he seems reluctant to use it to better his life.

A film that is billed as ""highly original"" is nothing of the kind. It merely lifts from a wide variety of diverse movies from Saturday Night Fever through Rocky to Love Story. However it owes more to Ordinary People (the film best remembered - or is it forgotten!? - for robbing Raging Bull of the Best Picture Oscar!) than any other.

Hard to really believe the central character who seems to have read lots of books and done a lot of studying off-screen (how, why and when are not fully explained). On-screen he seems much more interested in fighting on street corners, shouting at his working class friends (even when they are sat next to him), and getting clever-clever with authority.

Good performance from Matt Damon in the central role, but Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who helps him (and who himself ends up helped), is the standout. Here is guy who can say more with a look than most actors can do with a hundreds lines of dialogue. Shame that even the academics seem to swear just as readily and just as often as those lower down the food chain.

Mini Driver is quite touching as an English student (rich - but not a bitch!) who catches our hero's eye. While bringing dimension to the movie, you get the feeling that this was included in case the rest of the plot flopped. It wouldn't take too much editing to make this the central theme with the rest being the background. However this was not needed.

Too many good moments and too much of an engaging plot for us not be lightly charmed - but I wasn't moved by this movie. Our hero's working class friends are loyal - but that is about all you can say for them. Ben Affleck (in the ""best friend"" role) shows that haircuts, cheekbones and teeth are still what really counts in tinsel town.

The sterile world of (Boston) academia and the juvenile world of the street (as portrayed here) both alienated me. Can there not be middle way for our will-he-won't-he protagonist? The movie seems just as confused on this point as I am and in the end cops out of answering it.",7

13 September 1998,"The myth of ""genius""","Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's ""genius"" is concerned. Not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big ""S"" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.

Among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/. It isn't ever so multi-faceted. And it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries.

Better to have made Will a basketball prodigy. Except that Damon's too short.

23 September 2022,Good Will Hunting is a wonderful drama about the talented young mathematician Will,"Good Will Hunting is a wonderful drama about the talented young mathematician Will. A superb cast, surprisingly it's one of Matt Damon's best acting works. And of course, a wonderful game by Robin Williams. A Good Will Hunting drama that exists and will exist beyond time, it will always be relevant. Good Will Hunting is a prime example of demonstrating people's self-reflection. Throughout the film, 2 societies are opposed: the intelligentsia societies led by Gerald Lambeau and the societies of ordinary friends with Chuck. The finale of Good Will Hunting is excellent, Will chose love after all, which only happens 1 time.

29 June 2003,"Can you say ""hype""?","I know for sure, that if Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had not been the ones credited with having wrote this film, nobody would have seen this film. Whats more, nobody would have cared. This is Hollywood at its ""Indie"" best. Trying to pretend that some of their hot properties can be artistic as well. The only problem is that this film is so painfully average and predictable, that few film festivals would have given it the time of day, had it not been for the writers. The story is an old one, just set in a bit of a different setting. Young tough, down on his luck, born poor, no future, gets opportunity and betters himself. Ahhh, what a ""feel good"" story. Please! I just love the scene in the bar where Will shows up the cocky Harvard kid on his knowledge of American History. Damon reels off one of the most laughable historical arguments in American History. The information is accurate, but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument, even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does. It was an average at best movie that was hyped into a masterpiece. I dismiss the Academy, because I know how the Hollywood Insider game is played. I mean, come on, Kim Bassinger and Mira Sorvino have an Academy! LOL! I mean, Beverly Hills Cop won for best screenplay, even though it had been passed around for five years. In reality, this film is ** out of ****. However, did you know that Matt and Ben wrote it? **** out of ****.",1

18 November 2004,Not By Brains Alone,"Will Hunting is a young working-class man from South Boston who works as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His favourite pastimes are hanging out with a gang of his friends, getting drunk, getting into fights and breaking the law. He also happens to be a mathematician of genius, whose talents are revealed when he is seen writing out the answer to a problem which has baffled the world's greatest mathematical minds and which Professor Lambeau, a lecturer at the Institute, has written on a blackboard. The Professor becomes Will's mentor, trying to nurture his mathematical talents, and when Will again gets into trouble with the law on assault charges, Lambeau arranges a deal whereby he will qualify for parole provided he agrees to psychiatric treatment. The first two psychiatrists Will is sent to find him too much to handle, but eventually Lambeau refers him to an old friend, Sean Maguire.

Maguire is an unhappy man, grieving over the death of his wife. At first he and Will find it difficult to get on with each other, but later discover a rapport. The rest of the film can be seen as the story of the psychological journeys of Will and Sean. (The film's title is presumably a laboured pun on the main character's name and on the meaning 'hunting for goodwill'). Will must decide whether to develop his talents or to remain with his friends in the blue-collar milieu with which he is most familiar; he also needs to overcome his childish, self-destructive impulses and develop a more mature, responsible attitude towards others, particularly his girlfriend Skylar. Sean needs to come to terms with his devastating loss.

Robin Williams's touching performance as Sean is nonetheless a very good one, and quite the best thing about this film, although I am not sure that it was really deserving of an Oscar (I preferred Anthony Hopkins in 'Amistad'). On the other hand, I thought that Williams deserved Oscars for 'Good Morning Vietnam' and 'Dead Poets Society' and was passed over on each occasion, so justice has finally been done. I was less impressed, however, by the other leading actors. Stellan Skarsgard was not convincing as Lambeau and Minnie Driver as Skylar even less so.

More crucially to the success of the film, Matt Damon never succeeded in bringing Will to life or in bridging the gap between the two sides of his character, brilliant intellectual on the one hand and street thug on the other. To be fair to Damon the actor (as opposed to Damon the scriptwriter), the fault lies less in the way the character is played than in the way the character is written. Will is not just a brilliant mathematician but a brilliant polymath with an encyclopedic knowledge of subjects such as history and law. (He uses the former in a devastating put-down of an arrogant Harvard student in a bar, and the latter in an attempt to defend himself in Court). To judge from his conversations with Sean, he also seems to fancy himself as a psychoanalyst. It is possible that a person with only basic formal education could have acquired such knowledge of diverse subjects, but only through a rigorous programme of study, and Will's life outside of his work seems to revolve around bar-rooms rather than libraries and boozing and brawling rather than auto didactic learning.

Besides the central character's lack of credibility, the film's other main weakness is its funereal pace- too much talk and too little in the way of action. The central message- that man cannot live by the intellect alone, but also needs emotional sustenance and a system of moral values- is a worthy one, but I would have liked to have seen it conveyed in a more believable and less long-winded manner. 5/10 (a mark that would have been lower but for Williams).",5
17 March 1999,Good Will Hunting,"Matt Damon stars as a snotty but gifted natural mathematician from South Boston who searches for answers with the help of Sean McGuire, played to perfection by Robin Williams. (Oscar-winner) A fine film with only a few dead spaces, mainly Minnie Driver, who, unlike her performance in the lovely ""Circle of Friends"", feels dreadfully out of place here. Ben Affleck isn't annoying. That's a first!

26 January 2019,"Good Movie, But Overhyped","GOOD WILL HUNTING is a good movie, no doubt about it. The story is great and intriguing and told well. The performances and writing are good. But it is NOT this great movie that everyone makes it out to be, not in my opinion at least. It was fun and enjoyable, but I found it to be nothing groundbreaking. It is not even Gus Van Sant's best film. And the title is so stupid, right? I think it's supposed to be a pun about hunting for goodwill or something, and the character's name is Will Hunting, which I think they just did for the title. I hate when they do that, like with that movie JUST WRIGHT and a bunch of others.

The story is even a bit unbelievable and feels fake at points, and not in a good way. But overall, it's still a good movie. The dialog and acting are great, especially from Robin Williams. Even Ben Affleck (who I don't like much) is alright in this, as he's not the main character so we don't have to watch him for too long. Recommend.

31 August 2009,A Working Class Hero Is Something to Be,"Muscular genius Matt Damon (as Will Hunting) works as a janitor at Boston's M.I.T. (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology); but, he's smarter than the professors teaching there, like Stellan Skarsgard (as Gerald Lambeau). When nobody's looking, Mr. Damon solves complex mathematic problems on Mr. Skarsgard's chalkboard. At night, he goes out carousing with Ben Affleck (as Chuckie Sullivan), a likewise handsome drinking buddy. Mr. Affleck wants best friend Damon to use his head for more than a hat-rack.

Abused as a orphan, Damon likes to take his pals out to beat guys up, as a chaser. Eventually, this socio-emotional behavior lands Damon in jail. Professor Skarsgard, who has discovered Damon's a fellow intellect, sets him up on probation, with psychologist Robin Williams (as Sean Maguire). Mr. Williams asks Damon if he has a ""soul mate"". Damon is dating pre-med Minnie Driver (as Skylar), but has trouble committing. Can Ms. Driver, Affleck, Skarsgard, and Williams save Damon from a lifetime of janitorial eloquence?

Right, any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance. Sure, they hang out in bars and pick fights ¬ñ it's not like they are (generalizing wildly) autistic nerds who never have a tan.

Plus, if you are a genius you know all about Math and History and Politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them. Coz these things, like, all go together n stuff, y'know?

Plus, you walk around with a smirk all the time. You are just a smug son of a you-know-what, that's how it is, y'all.

And of course you smoke, like someone who never smoked before, but you smoke coz it's like cool n stuff, y'know. And you're different. That is understood.

And of course you can fight ¬ñ you're a bully. A bully who finds time to study 10.000 books whenever he doesn't lift weights. And whenever he doesn't smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health regimen.

And you date a 30-something college student ¬ñ Minnie Driver. Well, I won't even comment Matt Damon. Team America has hit the nail on the head already.

8 February 2004,Extremely dissapointing,"I can't understand why people like this film.

The basic concept was great, but it could have been SO much better.

It fails on many levels:

1: The basic story makes no sense. Will Hunting is shown to possess not just intelligence, but extreme awareness of a vast, VAST body of literature. He can quote obscure books in psychology, economics, art, etc etc etc

Here's a news flash: this kind of knowledge doesn't come from innate intelligence, it also requires incredible amounts of reading. So when did Will supposedly do all this reading? we see him depicted as a working-class goof-off who spends his time carousing with his friends and getting into fights. Sorry, but that doesn't compute. At all.

2: The direction and editing is terrible. All of the key moments go by as if they weren't even important. The end of the movie just leaves you saying, ""Huh?.....""

But my, aren't the lead actors good looking? That, and the superb performance by Robin Williams are all that can be said for this amateur effort. But what do I know....",2
16 February 2015,One of the best films of all time,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

2 December 2021,One of the most moving films of all time.,"I simply love this movie. One of the best and most moving scripts of all time; filled with beautiful emotional depth. The way Matt Damon and Robin Williams' characters each draw you into their authentic worlds and unique idiosyncrasies made for an all time wonderful movie watching experience. Robin Williams' performance is one of my favorites of all time and he never ceases to get a tear or twenty out of me. This is one of the most beautiful motion pictures of all time.

20 July 2007,Must See Flick,"The name of the film always put me off watching it. Ever so glad i was convinced in to it.

Only the fact that there is so much bad language and for Titanic being released in the same year this would have swept the boards in the Oscars!

I hate Robin Williams as a comedian, but i was in tears after watching his timeless performance. I love most of the classic movies but this is definitely the best film i have ever seen

Mat Damon played a great part, showing the full spectrum of emotions in his role.

I've ever gone out and bought the soundtrack to the film, i've watched it half a dozen times and always go right through to the final credits.

Pure brilliance!",10
27 August 2018,It's never too late for a new start on life,"Will Hunting (played by Academy Award Winner Matt Damon) has a brilliant mind. He can solve any equation and loves to read school books, thus he is very smart. He is also there for his friends, particularly his best friend Chuckie (played by Academy Award Winner Ben Affleck). But he is also very young and reckless. After one too many brushes with the law, Will is placed in jail, but he is offered a way out: study mathematics while his professor (played by Stellan Skarsgard) tries to get him job offers and he will get psychiatric help. After going through many psychiatrists, he finally meets his match in Sean Maguire (played by Academy Award Winner Robin Williams). Whilst doing these math problems and going to appointments, he also meets a beautiful young woman named Skylar (played by Academy Award Nominee Minnie Driver). All of these people are amazing people who are there for Will. The question is: Can he figure out his own problem before he pushes them all away?

This is a beautiful movie. Plain and simple. The editing...the music...the song ""Miss Misery"" by the late great Elliot Smith...there are so many things that are worth mentioning here. But let's start with the writing. I said that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won Oscars in their career. Well, it was for this movie and it was for their writing skills. This is the movie that put both actors on the map and they have done it in a way that nobody else has ever done. There is a lot of swearing in this movie, yes, but it is essential to the story. It's an amazing thing, the writing in this movie; they were in their twenties and they both wrote this movie as if they had been doing this for a long time. An Oscar that was well deserved.

Also worthy of praise is the great Gus van Sant. While he hasn't directed a lot of films, two of the three that he is well known for show his greatness as a director (Every director has their own personal ""Psycho"" remake, unfortunately). While he was also nominated for his direction of ""Milk"" in 2008, it's this film that shows his strengths as a fine director. He knows what to do; he is a hands-on director. One such example of his hands-on approach is the painting in Sean's office. That painting was painted by van Sant himself. It is just a small but vital example as to how van Sant knew what he was doing. Honestly, he should have gotten the Best Director Oscar that year.

Speaking of well-deserved Oscars, let's talk about the cast here. The two main cast members that were not nominated for Acting Oscars - Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard - both do an outstanding job nonetheless. If Ben Affleck's movies have convinced you that he can't act, check this movie out. Without a doubt, he pulls it off. And Stellan Skarsgard pulls it off as a professor who just wants to see Will succeed wherever he's at. But let's face it: there is a reason why Damon, Williams and Driver got nominated for Oscars. They are the true standouts here. Driver is so much more than just a girlfriend to Will; she has her own backstory and, although it is only briefly mentioned, you can tell that it is an important moment in her life - a moment that has defined her. Driver definitely should have gotten that Oscar. Damon is also amazing in the main role; there are a couple of scenes where he gets to me, particularly one where he truly reveals what has happened in his past. When he reveals what has happened in his past, it is very clear as to why he acts the way he does - why he pushes people from his life. Damon portrays that inner conflict very well in a role that should have landed him his first Acting Oscar (no disrespect to Jack Nicholson, though).

However, the standout performance is that of the late great Robin Williams. A lot of people remember him for his comedic roles like Mrs. Doubtfire, Aladdin and Good Morning Vietnam. Some remember him for his dramatic roles in Dead Poets Society, The Fisher King, One Hour Photo and Insomnia. Some remember him for his adventurous roles in Hook and Jumanji. But this...this is my personal favorite performance that he has ever done. He is able to tone done his crazy antics for the most part, but when he does up the crazy a bit, it is certainly viable to the scene. But that park bench scene and a certain scene towards the end are my two favorite scenes that he has ever done.

While I spent a lot of this review giving credit where it was due, I do have to end off by saying: Thank you, Robin. Thank you for all the magic that you have given us. Thank you for the laughter, tears and smiles that you gave us through your amazing performances. I am truly sorry that you could not find that joy within yourself, but I hope to someday see you up in Heaven with God and the rest of His Angels. Just remember: it's not your fault.",9

6 August 2021,Life Lessons!!,"Good Will Hunting absolutely deserves the label ""Timeless Classic"" and with very good reasons: the movie not only asks the viewers to question the importance that high-education provides in a society in which the elite thrive but also to ask the same very basic question that Sean 'Robin Williams' asks Will 'Matt Damon' ""What do you want?"" With fantastic storyline-progression, ""real human"" performances and dialog which will remain etched in your mind forever make no mistake: you can watch this movie in any year and in any time and it will still have the same impact.

""How do you like them apples?"" will be a rhetorical question you can't wait to use after you watch this. As the final shot ends with a car on a highway and the credits start to roll, you will be both satisfied at the ending while sad that the movie itself is over.

Do not miss this. Ever. It's worth every minute.

20 February 2004,good script hunting?,"I have never believed for a minute that Matt and Ben really wrote enough of this script to win an Oscar each. I get the feeling it really was the encouragement award not the Best Original Script award. I hope time proves me right and it is revealed that several other experienced ghost writers added the plot turns and the odd funny quip. I think it is primarily cursed with swearing and lazy characterization and it basically does not make sense. If Will is such a genius why can't he work out that behaving like a completely obnoxious idiot won't get him anywhere? etc...I agree with most of the criticisms on this site and place it gently in the bin for Movie Psychotherapy For American Audiences Who Need Movies To learn How To Behave.

30 March 2002,I Feel Dirty And It Won't Wash Off,"I first saw this movie when it came out in the cinema and enjoyed it. Then I saw it again today on TV and was dismayed at much I had apparently been sucked in by the Hollywood hype: two kids write the screenplay, star in it as well, it's an utterly brilliant film and gets an Oscar -- and I fell for it hook, line and sinker. OK, I will let this be a lesson to myself. The way I see it today is that it is a well - executed film, but the story is pure drizzle. Not just non - academic yob turns out to be talented, that would have been a realistic premise and could have made for a likeable movie. But not good enough for Hollywood -- instead it has to be a janitor at the MIT, and of course he is a gazillion times more brilliant than the professor (who is of course a field - medal - aspiring genius in his own right) of the very building he is working in. Hold on, I'm not finished. And this dude is also a genius in other areas, at least enough so to impress the judge with his legal cognizance, and he can quote lengthy passages out of philosophy books and he's into organic chemistry just for kicks, and he is a total fire - fighter - cute hunk as well, and he's good at fisticuffs too, and he wins the heart and hand of this super - intelligent, cute and rich chick who turns out to have a heart of gold and is the only one to accept him for what he really is, but he has got this problem facing his own genius because he would rather continue his squalid life of petty crime and dead - end jobs (hey, don't we all?), but then this brilliant psychiatrist who looks ten times more like Sigmund Freud than the man himself comes to the rescue, and -- totally unexpected -- things tie up to a happy end. HOW ON EARTH COULD I EVER HAVE FALLEN FOR THIS CRAP? Did Hollywood temporarily lobotomize me? Please, someone, shoot me!

OK, the bottom line: highly forgettable film. End of bottom line.",
24 November 2020,Nothing too special,"It's a good story, and overall a good film. There's just no action or intensity in it, nothing that pops out. It's just a good story. If you want a break from a lot of action and craziness in movies, this one's a nice film to watch.

1 March 2019,"""It's not your fault""","Not many films make make me shed a tear. This film moves me.

A young genius and his challenges in life and love, learning to combat his own damage and use his abilities or destroy himself.

Yes, it has some tiny defects, some obviousness. But what a cast, Matt Damon and Minnie Driver are chemically alive. Look for the ""if you say you don't love me scene"" it's sublime. They are kids in this, but their acting is ageless.

Robin Williams parental, warm and loving role, makes you want the hug, and the indelible and repeated line ""it's not you fault"" is hard to describe. It's a ""moment"". RIP. Robin. This film makes me sad you left.

Stellan Skarsg√•rd plays a great role, the skill in which means I don't love him, but the perfect role compliment Robin and Matt and a deft job.

The rest of the cast contains supporting actors which could easily be leads, with Ben and Casey Affleck are perfect in their roles as buddies.

Some films show you the magick in movies, this is one. Simple human concepts with, great cinematography, and wonderful acting. A near perfect film.

Watch it. 9/10",9
25 August 2003,"An enjoyable and moving film, despite the fumbles of Affleck.","A very good film, if somewhat unfulfilling and light in regards to the unexplored relationships from Will to Sean and Skylar. Robin Williams shows the beginnings of his serious, and sometimes darker, side. Matt Damon shows excellent promise, while Ben Affleck fumbles along as he has in many of his roles since. Still, it's a moving tale with some heartfelt scenes, particularly the defining moments between Will to Sean and Skylar.

22 January 2011,"You say Minnie Driver is ugly, and I say you should go to a hospital.","After I watched the movie, I thought the message board of IMDb is already filled with the comments that how Minnie Driver is naturally beautiful or how her acting in this movie was fantastic. But, WTF? everybody put the negative comments about her or how ugly she is, and some people even said that she was totally miscasted. IMO, I seriously doubt that she was miscasted. Although I admit she is not the most beautiful woman in the world, she is incredibly beautiful in a very natural way, and I'm sure that the none of the Hollywood actresses could have gave a performance like she did in this film. It's little sad that the most of people only care about actresses' looks.

Anyway, the movie was just great as I expected. Every single actor/actress did a great job in the film, and I still can't believe Mat and Ben wrote a whole script of the movie. It seems to me that the best part of this movie might be Minnie Driver's acting, her lovable character was definitely one of the kind, and I might be disappointed if they used a typical Hollywood actress instead of her.

Is it worth to watch this movie? Yes, abso-freaking-lutely Yes!",8

6 December 2021,Great but not a homerun,"Good Will Hunting is about Will Hunting (played by Matt Damon), a kid from the south of Boston. He is a genius born into a life of poverty and is on the wrong path in life. He meets a psychologist (played by Robin Williams) who helps guide him towards a better life.

I really enjoyed Good Will Hunting. It has some great moments, some funny ones and some pretty emotional ones. Will is a very complex character and it's interesting to follow his journey and attempt to understand him. I really enjoyed his relationship with Sean (the psychologist). I thought the scenes with Will and his friends added some great humour and made for some good breaks to lighten up the mood. Will's relationship with Skylar was also great to watch but I would've liked to more of it. I wish that the movie would've been extended a couple of more minutes with a scene or two between them at the end. My only complaint about this movie is its ending. I am having hard time putting it into words but I would've liked to see more. I don't say this often but I woudn't mind if the movie was longer because I felt that the ending was kind of abrupt and a bit unsatisfying. It didn't feel quite right, like there was more of the story and more of Will to be explored and like there just was more to be said. I guess I would've liked more certainty about what happens to Will in the future as well.

To summarize, as said in the title this movie is great, but not a homerun. In my opinion it falls on the finish line, but then again it's an opinion and you might like it. Other than that the movie was really good and enjoyable to watch. I would absolutely recommend it if you are into dramas with a bit of romance and that are kind of emotional but even if you aren't I still believe it's worth a watch.",8
4 February 2021,When You Find That Perfect Film . . .,"This long-time cinephile finally got herself an IMDb account, so let's discuss my favorite movie of all time.

Good Will Hunting is the one and only film that I genuinely will not shut up about once you get me started on it. I saw it in its entirety for the first time when I was fourteen and have carried its story and themes with me ever since. No movie has ever touched me as deeply as this one. From its careful approach to its honest execution, there is nothing at fault.

What really separates Good Will Hunting from other films and ultimately propels it forward is its brilliant screenplay combined with the commanding performances at its center. Damon and Affleck's writing is witty, poignant, and simply flawless from start to finish. The tonal shifts between bits of comedy and intense drama are so well balanced. There are quite a few monologues throughout, yet they never feel overbearing as a viewer because all of them come from a place of truth as well as dedication to the characters at hand. A script this perfectly crafted could have very easily been mishandled by the wrong actors but thankfully, the whole cast brings out everything the writing asks of them.

The late Robin Williams in his Oscar-winning role never ceases to mesmerize me, and it remains my favorite performance of all time. No one captures authenticity quite like Mr. Williams does, and there is a certain profoundness to his work in this film that I honestly believe cannot be taught or replicated. Everyone knows about how powerful the park bench scene and the ""it's not your fault"" scene are, but another one that I have always adored is when Sean is telling Will about the day he met his wife. The range of emotions that Williams portrays -- from initial nostalgia, to sheer exuberance, to quiet sensitivity -- may honestly be the most outstanding bit of acting I've ever seen.

Aside from him, a performance and character that I believe doesn't get enough recognition in this movie is Minnie Driver as Skylar, who is also the only woman in the main cast. I find that stories told from male perspectives often portray their female love-interests as one-dimensional, lifeless characters whose only purpose is to give the protagonist a romantic relationship. They add little to the actual plot and have little to do just in general. But despite Good Will Hunting being from a man's point of view, the character of Skylar feels fully realized. Driver is exceptionally raw and engaging throughout, specifically in the climatic scene between her and Damon. Beyond her magnetic performance, the script allows for Skylar to be a lovable and charming presence on screen, making the relationship between her and Will that much more refreshing.

Good Will Hunting also does not take the easy way out in exploring its themes, especially the causes and effects of mental illness. The movie actually never goes into full detail regarding Will's past, but it doesn't need to. Every decision he makes is rooted in the trauma he experienced as a child. His resistance to self-improvement, the stubbornness behind his ideologies, the way he pushes people away just as they start to get close -- everything can be traced back to the memories he refused to face before meeting Sean and attending therapy. The way the film progressively uncovers his story and perspective is incredibly well done, and a perfect model for character studies.

I could go on and on. This is one of those movies that everyone should take the time to see in their lifetime. It's rare to be so moved by a film that its stays with you your whole life -- Good Will Hunting is that film.",10

18 July 2003,"and now, ABC After school special presents.","So many fans, so little to show for it. I know, I know, these words are gonna find me in a great minority. A lot of people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously please, great film making, not even close, and let's put the blame where it belongs... in the writing.

Now, I know they won an oscar for it, and boy did they look good emoting on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.

What this movie does show, is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons. And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.

Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great Made for TV movies (although, not HBO films, HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice, little film, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while. And of course, the Miramax public relations machine secured Ben and Matt their screenwriting oscar... but come one people... there's better movies out there thatn GWH.",1
18 January 1999,One of the most powerful movies I've witnessed,"I sat down watching this movie, thinking hey this isn't gonna be a very good movie. Well guess what I was wrong, I was struck by Robin Williams Oscar winning performance (which he deserved), Matt Damon was also very good in the lead role as Will Hunting. Ben Affleck was also very good as his friend, so what I'm saying is that this cast who played in this movie were very talented, and deserved all they got. The movie itself is very very and I mean very POWERFUL. It strikes you like a 2x4 coming out of nowhere. So I suggest whoever has not seen this movie, well you're missing something. Go rent or buy this movie. You will find the performance of the actors are great, and the movie itself will touch you and movie you like never before. And oh yeah all the rumors about the cussing is true, but after a while you don't hear them anymore. The humor is in it, the drama is in it, and the goodness is in this film, which everyone of all ages should see. Take the time now, and go see this film! I give it a 10. Rated R for strong language and sexual dialogue.

30 August 2023,Are you living up to your full potential?,"My first awareness of Good Will Hunting came about when I saw Matt Damon and Ben Affleck excitedly jumping around on the stage after winning Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards. I didn't really know what the movie was about, but I appreciated their enthusiasm. When I finally saw the film, I was highly impressed by the performances of the entire cast, especially Robin Williams. He manages to balance drama and comedy so well. Good Will Hunting is a simple story, but it's a powerful one, and it makes you contemplate if you're living up to your full potential, whatever that may look like.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10
7 February 2009,Not So Good Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting is a story about a genius who for various reasons has not been able to take advantage of this and, when we are introduced to him in the film, is working as a cleaner at a university. This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsg√•rd. And it goes from there.

I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers. I would have no problem with this, if this was a good movie, which unfortunately, it is not. Minnie Driver also is not good looking enough for her part to be believable.

Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite directors, although I find his later more ""experimental"" movies - like Elephant, Paranoid Park and Psycho - much more rewarding as opposed to his earlier work which is more conventional and main stream. The main problem with this film though lies within the script, so I suppose he did what he could with what he was given in this case. For a movie to be entertaining, gripping and interesting, you need a conflict. I fail to find such a thing in this motion picture, and I did look for it the entire running time.

It is a mystery as to what you are supposed to feel for the main character in this film. It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be: A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.

It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.

In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake: It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive: Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play. When I saw Matt Damon in this film all I could think of was his involuntary part in Team America: World Police. ""MATT DAMON!"". Even though he was played by a doll in that film, his part seemed more real than in Good Will Hunting.",1

11 July 2017,"""How do you like them apples?""","I just loved this film! Excellent screenplay and writing as well as directing.

This film put Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on the A-List menu. Their performances where perfectly convincing for the characters they played.

Robin Williams was the perfectly cast prof.

It was refreshing to see such a different film portraying college kids and their lives as well as the competitiveness associated with grades and success.

And of course the infamous line: ""Do you like apples? How do you like them apples?""

Great film and a must watch!

A perfect 10/10 from me!",10
19 July 2019,Good Will Hunting - A gem of a movie,"Matt Damon and Robin Williams are the perfect pair, and for a movie that was released in 1997, it really holds up!


This story hits home for me specifically, which is why I give it such a high score, but is definitely not the only reason I rated it so. One of the best examples in film of well executed character development, not only in the role of Will Hunting (Matt Damon) but also for Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Will is a unknown genius, working as a janitor at a local university. He suffers with many different problems that are focused on throughout the film, building beautiful connections with other characters. The intensity in some of these scenes are just breathtaking, creating almost a sort of discomfort, but in a good way if that makes sense. This movie centers around emotions and feelings, which is something that I really appreciate and connect to. Highly recommend to watch this if you haven't!",8
25 June 2001,"A cliched, sentimental, empty experience","Sometimes I think I'm living on another planet to rest of the movie going public! How this mediocre piece of rubbish earned ANY praise, let alone an Oscar is truly beyond me. I sat through this movie with its predictable by-the-numbers plot and cliched characters (the misunderstood genius from the wrong side of the tracks, the wounded 'teacher' who gets healed from his 'pupil', the rich girl who is REALLY NICE when you get to know her and loves the poor boy for HIMSELF) and had to stop myself from laughing out loud at the ridiculousness of it! This is supposed to be a GREAT MOVIE??! Get a grip people!

Van Sant what happened to you?? I can't believe all the promise you showed with Drugstore Cowboy and My Own Private Idaho (both ten times better than this). Now we have Good Will Hunting and the AWFUL, pointless remake of Psycho. I shake my head in disbelief.

Only positive thing I can say is there are a few lovely Elliot Smith songs on the soundtrack. Buy one of his albums and avoid this movie at all costs.

10 November 2005,Hell and the Lonely genius,"When searching for intellectual success and humanistic relationships between life and career, there is a simple formula which works for a few people. It is an equation which reads, Superior intellectual equals power, but results in pain and isolation. Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon. Born with a I. Q. Genius, the young man seeks friends and mathematical challenges alike. Consequently when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other. As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities. Unable to tolerate authoritative or academic hypocrisy, he armors himself with the sword and shield of intellectual arrogance and gives battle to anyone and everything around him. What troubles him the most is the dark pain of abuse in his youth and it is here he is most vulnerable. Robin Williams who portrays Dr. Sean Maguire give one of his most stirring performances as a sensitive and compassionate psychiatrist. Equally matched as they are adroit, the two battle in an emotional arena, each seeking to fathom the other. The result? The creation of a truly remarkable film. ****",9
12 September 2013,"F***, Will Hunting (the character) isn't that f***ing good","I don't usually talk like that; I'm just poking fun at the characters in the film. If you find that blurb offensive you'd better skip this movie.

""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT. A Math professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd), posts a difficult problem on the board and is amazed to discover that Will solves it. Will gets in trouble with the law but Lambeau gives succor and enlists the help of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to get him on the right path. Meanwhile Will is falling for a Harvard girl (Minnie Driver).

The plot of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down.

For one, Will Hunting is not a ""good"" person, as the title suggests (I'm sure they were being ironic). In fact, he's so smart he's stupid. Doesn't he know that smoking will destroy his body and send him to an early grave? But that's the least of Will's shortcomings. He's arrogant and unnecessarily mean. For instance, Professor Lambeau visits him in jail and Will's first words are, ""What the f*** do you want?"" Could anyone be that stupid? How about, ""Hi, I'm Will. Who are you, Sir?"" I get it -- he's from a tough neighborhood and was abused as a kid, but 99% of guys from tough neighborhoods who were abused as kids don't talk unnecessary sheet like Will does in this film.

In fact, too much of the cussing rings untrue. Will and his three friends from South Boston (including Ben Affleck) use the f-word practically every other word and it strikes an inauthentic chord. Yes, I get it -- they're trying to act like hooligans from a rough neighborhood -- but they try too hard and it comes off contrived.

I should add that I hail from a hooligan-oriented neighborhood where the gang cussed, drank & smoked like sailors, but even we could construe eight words together without throwing in the f-word. I have no problem with realistic cussing in films; in fact, I prefer it. But when it's so over-the-top that it seems artificial it detracts from the drama.

Furthermore, Damon doesn't LOOK like a tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks (neither does Ben, but he's a little better). Matt's miscast because he just looks too soft with his baby-face. I think he knew this because he tries too hard to be a tough punk, and it shows.

The fact that the main protagonist is thoroughly unlikable takes away from the story. Who cares about some disrespectful punk who doesn't care to better himself, genius or not? As a result, the drama isn't nearly as compelling as it could've been. When Sean (Williams) finally gets Will to break at the end, I wasn't much interested.

Still, if you can handle the trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough acting and dialog, ""Good Will Hunting"" is worth catching if you like dramas. For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho-therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms. Skarsg√•rd is also excellent. And please don't take my criticisms the wrong way because there IS some good drama in this film, but it's buried underneath contrived writing and the corresponding performances (mainly Matt and Ben).

Incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.

The film runs 126 minutes and was shot on location in Massachusetts and Toronto.

15 June 2002,Excellent...except for Matt Damon,"A janitor at a MIT is secretly a genuis. Problem is he has a very mean, vicious streak, no self-esteem and abuses anyone who tries to help him...until he meets his match.

Well-directed, beautiful cinematography of Boston and Cambridge (some of the aerial photography was beyond belief), great acting by Robin Wlliams (he won an Oscar), Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver, sharp script, intelligent and very moving with just one problem...Matt Damon. Unfortunately, he plays the lead character...Will Hunting.

He's ugly, mean, sarcastic and gives an absolutely horrible performance. He wears the same blank expression all through the movie. Everybody else around him are great and they really carry the show.

Some people have criticized the movie for its frequent profanity, but that's how guys from South Boston talk. Also Affleck and Damon were born and raised in Cambridge so they have authentic Boston accents. It helps the tone of the film immensely.

So, it's a very very good film. It could have been great with a better leading man.

Well worth seeing...except for Damon. Concentrate on everything else.",9

1 January 2016,I do not understand this films greatness,"I'd saved this for a special day when I wanted quality. Shame. Completely bizarre and unrealistic story. So contrived and stupid. It wasn't remotely believable. Just silly. The point of the entire frame was to get Matt Damon and Robin Williams in the same room. They could've saved so much time shortening it. The rest was just transport. Everything about the kids life was uninteresting. The silliest sob story. His relationship with the Harvard girl was a yawn-fest. Bad acting.

I'm a liberal, so they were preaching to the choir, but even I found the long liberal speeches a bore. People don't talk like that. There's a rule in fiction... show don't tell. They forgot that rule. How did this film get nominated for nine Oscars, including best picture?!? This is first year English major level of writing. So bad dialogue. Such a weak contrived script. It tries to make some blindingly obvious points about it sucking to be poor. This is not news. Also... everybody was hot and sexy with a smoking hot body. Not believable at all. Just took me right out of it.

Both me and my girlfriend sat with dropped jaws wondering how this got so high ratings. The good acting does not save this film. Yes, there's some top notch fine acting here. Both Matt Damon and Robin Williams to stellar performances. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, who I know is a good actor, couldn't save his silly role. Such a stupid idea for a film.

I do not understand this films greatness",3
9 July 2021,"Well Deserved Oscars for Williams, Damon and Affleck","One of the benefits of ""Secret Movie Night"" is that it forces me to watch (or rewatch) a film that I would not seek out on my own. Such is the case with this month's selection - GOOD WILL HUNTING - the film that made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck stars and earned the late, great Robin Williams his only Academy Award.

Leaning hard on the mantra ""write what you know"", GOOD WILL HUNTING tells the tale of a generationally talented math prodigy, who grew up in South Boston and fights his demons to find his place in this world.

Famously, the screenplay of this film earned Damon and Affleck Oscars for Best Original Screenplay and it is well deserved. They paint a picture of life of these ""Southies"" that appears to me real and genuine. The ""family"" feel of the friendship of the main characters rings true and Damon and Affleck have real chemistry with each other - like old friends playing off each other.

However, the relationship between Affleck and Damon's character in this film is only the 3rd best relationship in this film. The best, of course, is the relationship between Will Hunting (Damon) and the shrink that is assigned to him, played by Robin Williams. It is a haunting, raw, emotional and REAL performance by Williams - one very deserving of the Oscar - and I was more than a little sad to watch this performance knowing that this uniquely talented performer is no longer with us.

The surprise to me in this rewatch of the film is the performance of Minnie Driver as a young lady that becomes emotionally attached to Will. Driver's performance as Harvard student Skylar is also real and the struggles of her character to get a connection with Will was heartbreaking to watch.

Good Will Hunting also features strong supporting work by Stellan Skarsgard as the MIT Math Professor who discovers - and then becomes jealous of - Will's talents and Ben Affleck's younger brother, a then unknown Casey Affleck, who steals almost every scene he is in.

All of this would not have worked without the magnificent, Oscar nominated, Direction of Gus Van Sant (DRUGSTORE COWBOY). He was the perfect choice to direct this intimate, personal drama and he has a way of drawing out the emotions and rawness of the characters on the screen without being cloying or overdramatic. He was a strong contender for Best Director that year (as was Good Will Hunting for Best Picture) but it ran into a roadblock that was James Cameron and TITANIC.

If you have never seen this film - or if you haven't seen this in quite some time - check out GOOD WILL HUNTING, it is well worth your time.

26 October 1998,Over-hyped Banal Trash,"What is it about this movie that people like so much? It is just a two-hour cliche, and a stiflingly boring one at that. It is essentially just a badly done and more obnoxious version of Little Man Tate or Searching for Bobby Fischer. However, the thoroughly average Matt Damon takes the part of the astounding misunderstood genius to a new level. Why? Because, get this: he's... older! Wow! What a twist! That makes it totally different!

The only bright spot of this movie is Robin Williams who was cast in the sadly stagnant role of the person who just wants to help our little genius, just as Jodie Foster did in Little Man Tate, or Laurence Fishburne in Searching for Bobby Fischer. Then, we have Stellan Skarsgard in the role that Dianne Wiest and Ben Kinglsey played in the aforementioned films: the academic who is vilified for their attempts to help the genius realize his squandered potential.

The only difference that this movie has from the other two I've mentioned is that the misunderstood genius is more independent and gives the establishment a lot of grief. Yeah, Will! Damn the man! Steal an idea! Take Little Man Tate, make him 10 years older and pretend it's a whole new movie!

29 January 2019,This movie stole my heart,"""Good Will Hunting"" grew on me slowly as I watched it, had an urge to want to turn it off a couple of times while watching but it all came down to one simple truth - this movie is great. It tells a story of a young man who doesn't know his place in life and wastes most of it drinking in a bar with friends, getting into fights occasionally and doing some crappy jobs. And literally no one would blame him for it, we've all been there. But one day a time comes along and it gives you people who challenge you to get out of your shell and find your path, help you become a better person. I think everyone needs something like this movie in his life to re-evaluate it and see it in the different light. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's script, although a bit predictable and immature, is almost perfect despite that. The story gives you everything you want from a movie, it gives you time to roll on your back with laughter and to cry your eyes out, gives you food to think and thoughts to hold on to. Robin Williams is brilliant, he's phenomenal, he's the best thing in this movie and his closing line - amazing. Took the words right out of my mouth. Matt Damon's performance is near perfection and one of the best in his career. It's a wonderful, kind, touching and thought-provoking movie. I loved it and would totally give it another watch.",10
21 October 2021,How did you believe this!?,"For god sake where in the world a boy who all the coming descriptions available in him: 1- he didn't get a university education 2- he spend the whole night in bars 3- he can solve math problems which a maths professor and whole math class in MIT can't solve 4- He also can understand stand Biochemistry topics that a Medicine student in Havard can't understand.

, But here you are the realism: he can't play the Piano! .. Are you kidding me!?

It's clear this combination is just crap.

It would have been pretty better if Matt Damon had been a student in the Maths class in MIT who is really smart, but has some psychological problems and that will be discussing a real problem that face students nowadays.

Just Robin Williams rescued this film. If it weren't for him this film would be very bad.",7
9 September 2018,A superb story with great actors,"Will Hunting, an apparently ordinary man, who works as a janitor for a famous school, manages to solve a very hard problem left on the hallway. Discovered by an equally famous professor, his brilliance and skill are about to be put to the test, but his very difficult character will prove to be the biggest challenge of all in his path of emancipation.

It's a superb story which although at first glance doesn't sound like much, manages to create a wonderful atmosphere. We watch Will evolution from a simple janitor to someone worth being proud of, with the help of his teacher and especially a psychologist who dedicates himself to Will's case.

It's a movie which understands how to create such a dramatic plot, insisting on Will's very difficult condition which made him end up in his current social position, keeping it up until the very end. The characters are very well developed and put into play, making you care about what is going on. It manages to be full of emotion, drama and even suspense as the characters ""fight"" to overcome their respective condition.

The movie manages to maintain a good line of unpredictability. It's non-linear nature makes it a very good example of how to make such a film, being able to generate plenty of eye goodness through its plot, characters but also wonderful acting, certainly deserving its very high rating.",10
6 April 1999,"pretentious, whiny genius","What is so good about this film? I hated this film with so many reasons. The hero,Matt Damon is a handsome genius with early life trauma,so he is allowed to do anything and using foul language and fist fighting and all that gives him extra charm. But he seemed like either a complete hypocrite or a artifice-made-to-plot to me. If all he wanted in life was getting drunk and fight why did he choose to work in the university(what a convenient place to be noticed for the sake of story) as a janitor in the first place? Why not burger king? With the vast knowledge and deep insight in politics, economics and psycho-analysis, why wasn't he able to get over with his own problem?

And that counselling session, learn-from-each other and klick!problem solved!!! No, it's so schematic and unconvincing as the whole film. I totally agree on the user comment(what an arrogant...) During the film, listening to their ping-pong talk, I thought of Forrest Gump. Despite all the flaws and non-sensical coincidences, I think Forrest Gump is a very moving film. If you ask the differences of the two films, I would say:

surrealism vs pseudo-realism

running(release of freedom,metaphor of advance, hope)vs talking(do you know what you are talking about?)

Ideal simpleton and whiny, pretentious genius.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9
11 December 2000,A genius kid from the streets conquers Harvard..,"I must say I really found this film very over-rated. First of all the story isn't even remotly credible. How can a street kid without any education solve mathematical puzzles that even professors at Harvard University can't work out ??? Albert Einstein is mentioned several times in the movie as a parallel to Will Hunting, but don't forget that Eintein said, that to become a genius, you need 2% inspiration and 98% transpiration. What makes it even worse is that Will not only masters mathematics but history, literature, chemistry etc. as well. To me, Will is much too much of a Superman, and I couldn't identify with him in ny way. I really believe that you have to strive hard to obtain knowledge and education, and the genius myth that lies behind this film I find totally ridiculous.

14 April 2023,Brilliant,"I cannot say enough great things about this movie. It is everything that a film should be. It has a story that is innovative and original and it will leave you with a smile on your face at the end. It has funny moments, it has sad moments, there are scenes of great intensity, with heart warming scenes as well. The dialogue is fantastic for which the Oscar for best original screenplay was awarded to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who went on to give one of the greatest Oscar speeches of all time. The whole backstory of this film plus the story on the screen and the success it went on to have plus the success it still has today is beyond inspirational. Damon and Affleck are brilliant. Robin Williams gives one of the greatest supporting acting performances I've ever seen in my life, for which he received an extremely well earned Academy Award. Minnie Driver gives a nice understated performance as well, which led to a well earned Best Supporting Actress nomination. Best Picture nom and Best Director nom for Gus Van Sant were also incredibly well deserved. This movie is a gem and will live on forever. Pure Film Brilliance.

11 April 2023,"Star picked, but not THAT great","Watching this movie kind of reminded me of A beautiful mind with Russel Crowe from 2001. Both feature a mathematic genius with social problems.

While I liked both movies I am not a big fan of such stories. I appreciate Matt Damon wrote this on himself, kind of impressing for sure. But it felt a bit long and boring.

I mean this movie is solid, do not get me wrong, but I would not rank it that high. IMdB Top 100 should be reserved only for big classics.

Nevertheless this is just my opinion. Maybe it turns out to be your favorite movie. Who knows? Watch it or watch it not, this is not a must see.

26 December 2014,"Way, Way, WAY Overrated, Maudlin, Schlocky Fairy Tale","It's a somewhat watchable film only for Matt Damon's above average understated performance and Robin Williams' usual quality work, but the emotionally manipulative story is just too overwrought and self indulgent to warrant my admiration.

A mathematical super-genius who chooses to clean toilets is such a nearly impossible, outlandish premise, but we're expected to swallow it hook line and sinker. Am I supposed to relate to the poor misunderstood prodigy with the humble, blue collar heritage? This is just a typical Hollywood Cinderella fantasy relocated to Academia with some heartrending pablum tossed in for the ladies. Delusional, nonsensical melodrama that deigns to present itself as insightful and profound, but it really isn't. It's mostly contrived and tedious.

17 March 2001,"My second comment, but","I had originally reviewed this movie a year after I saw it, and in my review, I gave it restrained praise. 'Does it have it's flaws. Yes. It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature'. After rewatching, I have to take those two comments back. It didn't seem too long during the second viewing, and Minnie Driver's character had real depth, something I had missed on my original viewing.

However, one thing that I have to comment on is the script. It felt much better the second time around. Damon and Affleck have a natural ability to create dialogue that flows, almost like lyrics to a song. None of it seems forced, and it becomes quite moving in several scenes. The scenes between Williams and Damon are so well written, and are acted very precisely, they become quite powerful.

The music also works quite well, something else that I overlooked in my first viewing. I'm glad I watched it again, and it's status had certainly risen in my mind.

25 June 2000,Robin Williams' Best,"""Good Will Hunting"" was the feel good movie of 1997, but it was Robin Williams (in an Oscar-winning role) showing his true ability as an actor that made the film work. The film deals with a troubled young janitor at MIT named Will Hunting (Matt Damon in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a mathematical genius in spite of his minimal education. ""Good Will Hunting"" is a combination of ""Rocky"" and ""Ordinary People"" in the fact that you pull for the underdog (Matt Damon) and you see how psychologically scarred he is through the man who is acting as his psychiatrist (Robin Williams). Is ""Good Will Hunting"" a great film? No, but it's one of those films that you can't help but like due to the elements that are in it. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

14 February 2023,Even better than I had remembered,"I just watched this after not having seen it for a couple of decades. I thought it was good then. I think it is great now.

I was more engaged with the story and found the emotional sequences very affecting. Perhaps being older has made me more sentimental. Hopefully, though, it's because I am more able to relate to the psychological trauma at the centre of the film, and so appreciate the relationship between Matt Damon and Robin Williams, which is wonderfully scripted and acted.

I see that Messrs Damon and Affleck have written other screenplays although perhaps none have had the same impact.

20 February 2010,Outstanding...,"Gus Van Sant's finest work as a filmmaker lies in 'Good Will Hunting', an outstanding film! Written brilliantly by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, here comes a film that will rank amongst 'The Best' in years to come. Without a doubt, 1997's best film! 'Titanic' was 2nd that year, yes it was!

'Good Will Hunting' tells the story of a janitor at MIT, who is a genius at maths, all he has to do is find a right direction & attitude, which he later achieves after a therapist makes him realize the true meaning of LIFE and Emotions. Now that's a Masterstoke! Some films entertain, some films enlighten, 'Good Will Hunting' caters to the latter. An Outstanding Film in all respects.

Van Sant's direction is Incredible, what a freaking filmmaker! Damon and Affleck's writing is stunning, a script that has 'Magic' written all over it. Jean Yves Escoffer's Cinematography is top-notch. Pietro Scalia's Editing is perfect. Music by Danny Elfman suits the mood of the film wonderfully.

Coming to the acting department, Robin Williams steals the show with a controlled & powerful performance. He deserved each and every bit of the Oscar he got! Matt Damon is fantastic, playing the role of Will Hunting with mature understanding. This is his best work as an actor yet. Minnie Driver is terrific. Ben Affleck is natural to the core. Stellan Skarsg√•rd delivers a bombastic performance all the way. Others lend able support.

'Good Will Hunting' gets a Two Big Thumbs Up! A Must Watch for each and every cinema fan alive!",9

28 August 2000,Do they know any words with more than four letters?,"Why in the world was this movie made? Why was the script written? The writers obviously wanted to showcase their command of four-letter words, but they apparently had nothing else on their minds.

This has to be one of the most totally empty-headed movies I've ever seen. The plot - if it can be called that - was both pointless and ridiculous. The acting involved getting a bunch of immature people to sit around calling each other names. I can't imagine ever recommending this movie to anyone.

13 June 2011,A well-made rather than a well-filled head ...,"Among the cinematic characters that I immediately identified with, there is ¬´ Good Will Hunting ¬ª, though I'm not fortunate enough to be gifted with the same intelligence ... BUT I know how it feels not to exploit one's own talents for his personal life and constantly try to find excuses for that.

The story is probably one of the most inspiring and best written scripts from the last two decades, and to think that Matt Damon is the co-writer, with his childhood friend, Ben Affleck ‚Äì they both played best buddies in the film- makes it even more realistic and inspiring. In fact, there is something that always works in the stories where the screenwriter and the lead actor are the same, take ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Great Dictator"", ""Rocky"", ""Sling Blade"" or the vast majority of Woody Allen's films, the character is written and played by the same actor, he's his own mind, and own body, there is an authentic feeling as if the man doesn't even play. The script is personal, and the film is only an excuse to transcend something personal into a biggest project that would create a wider appeal. And I would never say enough how ""Good Will Hunting"" appealed to me.

The story, is about a kid, a tough kid, an extremely intelligent tough kid who grew in South Boston and lived the kind of childhood that could have been laughably clich√© had the movie been handled by a bad director or editor. But the revelations of his past go so smoothly that Will Hunting, despite his good intentions, appears more like an arrogant prick than a victim, and THIS is interesting. To depict him as a victim would have considerably changed the value of his gift, it would have been the solution of his problems while in fact, it works like a double-edged sword. Will has an extraordinary power of abstraction, or memorization, of understanding that he can solve the toughest Maths problems, can speak of History, Geography, Politics, Economics, Philosophy, like you'd speak about the one thing that passionate you the most, and he probably knows better than you even in that field. Basically, Will makes you feel dumb, or useless, or unable to use your own knowledge. Even the professor Gerald Lambeau, who'll try to find a future for Will, ends up like a Salieri recognizing his worthless value compared to Will, the Mozart of Mathematics.

But the key of the story is to understand the reasons of Will's behavior, which obviously would lead him to a dead-end. When you think about it, his intelligence saved him from jail, which allowed him to know his girlfriend. Speaking of her, let's get back to the scene where they meet. The scene is probably one of the most memorable cinematic ""ownage"" where Will avenges his best friend who was victim of a literally intellectual bullying by an arrogant Harvard prick. Will puts him in his place with the idea that it doesn't takes studies to be intelligent, it takes enough curiosity to learn more than what we're intended to and then try to put that knowledge into perspective. An excellent lesson about how to use our intelligence. But then something ambiguous happens, when Will meets his therapist, Sean Maguire, Robin Williams in a quite perfect performance. Will acts with him exactly the same way the Harvard boy did, using his knowledge to try to push him down. But instead of being upset, Sean feels the potential of Will and a nice retort for the next meeting. ""Do you think I would understand how it feels to be an orphan because I read Oliver twist?"" Will knows, but his knowledge is theoretical, there's the tragic feeling of emptiness governing his life. Life is about guts, heart, emotions, and Sean, animated by a growing fatherly love, will try to open Will's heart, so he can give his life a meaning as Sean obviously found something in Will, to get out from his self-pitied widow condition, a man lost in his memories with no better future.

Will Hunting is not a bad guy, as implies the title's adjective. But he fears rejection, and hangs out with the same group which work like an indirect carapace. He's certainly not incapable of being friendly, in love or having fun, but as soon as things go serious, he becomes defensive. The movie provides a fascinating character study in the real sense of the world, we are put in the shoes of a psychiatrist and try to understand Sean's motives, and why Will is such a hard nut to crack. It's an intelligent movie about intelligence, and that respects our intelligence, and more than that, the intelligence of the film is carried by an excellent script that brings so many moments of verbal delights. Will's speeches are priceless; it's like reciting a whole book, with coherence and inspiration. And the films question our visions of intelligence : for Lambeau, it's Excellence, for Maguire, it's Happiness. The inspiring message of the film, is that Will Hunting can reconcile between both. Inspiring is indeed a word that rhymes with ""Good Will Hunting"". And I think Minnie Driver deserves a mention as the one who drove the heart element of the film, as Skylar ‚Äìwhy did they had to name her like that anyway-, who had such a genuine feeling, I thought her romance and break-up created another authentic dimension in Will's multi-layered personality.

""Good Will Hunting"" is an exploration into the complexities of human relationships, and on a self-reflexive approach, the conclusion of the film is like a mathematical problem finally solved, but human relationships is not an exact science you know, so maybe, I say maybe, happiness is a little more important than excellence ¬Ö as the French author, Michel de Montaigne, said once : ""a well-made rather than a well-filled head.""",10
28 February 2001,"Inspirational and enjoyable style, but too much of the film is recycled. **1/2 (out of four)","GOOD WILL HUNTING / (1997) **1/2 (out of four)

The tremendous, puzzling critical and public praise ""Good Will Hunting"" received utterly astounds me. What has America come to in order to get such great satisfaction out of a movie like this, jumping back and forth between presumptive concepts and a shameless plot; Gus Van Sant directs a script by Matt Damon and Ben Afflect, who think they are much better than they are. The two screenwriters actually took home the Oscar in 1997 for their work. But why? The movie certainly has an inspiring style, and if you do not try to hard you might find yourself having a good time watching it. But with more thought this script could have actually been worthy of the Awards it caught.

The movie takes place at a Boston University where we meet an egotistical and youthful janitor named Will Hunting (Matt Damon). Nobody would ever guess beneath his tough and cocky attitude, urges to get nowhere in life, series of problems with the law, and rebellious actions that he is the smartest individual in Boston, if not the planet Earth. It feels so customary, the most unexpected person in the university is the smartest. Most of us will not find ourselves surprised when we learn this character has a deeply troubled past.

Will Hunting beats the crap out of a police officer and finds himself with a demanding prison sentence. This is where the movie puts a new spin on an old clich√©: instead of a father pushing a rebellious offspring to live the life he wants him to live, here we have a college professor and a young janitor going at the notion. The professor (Stellan Skarsgard) realizes this young man has an extremely complex ability to solve mathematical problems and offers Will an alternative to jail time. He gets the reluctant juvenile a kind psychiatrist named Sean (Robin Williams). The filmmakers use this character to inject a bunch of other irritating dramatic contrivances in the story, dealing with previous child abuse, professional competitiveness, alcoholism, social class conflicts, jealousy, remorse, and guilt, but Damon and Affleck use these as predictable and formulaic tools to grab our emotions. They come off as amateurish and intractable.

Will is emerged in self-discovery when his relationship with Sean stabilizes. He also meets a nice, charming young girl (Minnie Driver), who provides the plot with some romantic tensions. Her character's presence is needed so we can actually witness the impact of his counseling. But Will's moral awakenings are hammered in our heads. It's like the filmmakers did not think we could figure things out on our own so they felt the need to spell things out. This is absurd; most audiences can perfectly see the intentions and emotional turmoil Will is going through. This movie insults our intelligence.

The plot and theme of this movie hinge too much upon the idea that it is difficult for an intelligent person to move from low-class to a honorable member of society. This is why the contrivances are so obvious. Even after some of the thoughtless writing, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make the amazingly egotistical choice of starring in the film themselves. Both are talented actors, and Affleck does no harm here; his character does not make much of an impact. It is Matt Damon who is one of the biggest examples of miscasting in recent movie history. Damon does not look like a tenement citizen regardless of how hard he tries. His performance is riddled with indolent character traits, like smoking and the frequent use of profanity.

Damon's character is also spectacularly aggravating. He originates no sympathy because Will is such a selfish idiot. Why should we root for him to succeed if he does not want success himself? Granted the character has a traumatic past and troubled emotions, but none of those things are executed in a convincing method, therefore it is up to Damon to fill the character with inspiration and livability, but I hated, hated, hated Will. I wanted Robin Williams to put a fist in his mouth. Is this what the filmmakers wanted, for us to despise the main character?

Damon makes the performances by Stellan Skarsgard and Robin Williams standout. Robin Williams inhabits the only sensible character here; I felt so good when he kicked Will out of his office. No wonder he won best supporting actor at the Academy Awards, he is terrific. The performance captures his character's emotional and comical perspectives. Sean is also supplied with an absorbing circle of being, depth and dimension. Damon's character also perspires of such material, but Will seems to be altered for the script's needs. One scene he is ambitious and defends his friends, other times he is arrogant and cocky, yet sometimes gentle and charismatic. Minnie Driver is also charming, but her character also feels somewhat controlled. She is a plot puppet, but at least she portrays the character with personality and zest.

Most of the movie has an enlightening and pleasant style, and if you are not too critical this movie does achieve its own goals. With so many problems with its plot, characters, and borrowed material, it's startling that ""Good Will Hunting"" feels uncluttered, organized, and so entertaining and human at times. But even the good substances contribute to a plate that may be a just bit too full for prosperity.",6
19 December 2022,Great writing,"A very engaging film with good dialogue, with an academic and therapy backdrop.

There is some fruity gritty language, romantic drama and one or two action scenes.

This was well written by Damon and Affleck at relatively youthful ages.

There are good interactions between the characters. Particularly so, Sean and Will, Chuckie and Will and Skylark and Will. The acting is to a high standard all-round.

One scene appears to have been influenced somewhat by Cyrano de Bergerac. Robin Williams gives a pared-down performance with just a couple of moments of trademark tomfoolery. I enjoyed Minnie Driver's performance.

19 April 2023,A classic film,"This is a classic film in my opinion, right up next to the Breakfast Club. It is one that will never go out of style, and will never stop being great. Matt Damon is a phenomenal actor, and really dives right into this character in the best way. The supporting characters are also phenomenal and you almost immediately become attached to them, and want to see them grow. The script is very well-done, with snarky little phrases and witty remarks scattered throughout. Again, something that will never go out of style. The storyline is so compelling. You really get to see Matt Damon's character grow and change into this phenomenal man. I think all audiences love to see that in movies- major character growth. I originally started watching this movie for Matt Damon, and because I had heard of it many times before but never watched it. And I am glad I finally made the time to watch it. The styling was one of my favorites from any movie I have seen thus far. The costumes were fun and matched each character perfectly, I loved getting to see Matt Damon's character's friends outfits especially. Overall, a great film and a classic that everyone should watch. It is lighthearted but impactful, and I think it would appeal anyone, not matter which type of film is your favorite. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun friday night movie.",8
14 April 2023,Great! will hunting,"Not many movies make me emotional enough to shed a tear. This one did on multiple occasions. On an airplane. Which is not the proper conditions for an emotional outburst. But it happened. God knows what would've happened if I watched this in the privacy of my own home! Stellar film with a chuck ton of heart. Felt authentic, was original.

I liked how it portrayed relationships Relationships between friends, and the safe loyalty that comes with that. I enjoyed the reality shown in Wills relationship with skyla. The natural fears many of us face with love. It spoke to the heart, because it got to the heart and it told the truth. Love is scary! Life is scary and imperfect. I think this film portrayed this imperfect reality well. I think sometimes in an effort to show the imperfections of life a movie can get pretty sloppy, like the fabelmans for example. That shows a messy life. And it left me feeling gross. But this film felt real, and full of hope and light. It's a film about overcoming! Really great film.

7 October 2000,I couldn't have cared less about Will Hunting,"I don't know. I just can't get into a film when three fourths of the way into it (actually all the way to the end of it) I wouldn't have cared one way or another if the main character stepped in front of a speeding bus. Matt Damon's character was so unlikeable that I stopped caring what was going on in the movie. The same year that this movie came out, Jack Nicholson made me care about an unlikeable character in As Good As It Gets. Matt Damon couldn't do that for me.

2 February 2023,Redemption,"A story of Redemption

Good Will hunting is emotionally a motivational and feel good movie . Story of a poor and orphan youngster who is genius yet broken one , his well wishers trying and saving him from not wasting his potential . Damon & Affleck as writers did a great job in characterisation and dialogue writing , especially motivational dialogues weren't usual generic type , it was natural , genuine and simple yet hard hitting . Characterisation for each characters were well designed , especially Will's redemption arc and other characters contributing and helping him in redemption path were well shown . Romance track in the movie too worked well . Robbin Williams , Matt Damon and Ben Affleck delivered an immersive performance , other cast too did a great job . Music and songs were good and mind blowing .

Didn't noticed any drawbacks .

Overall , a classic feel good movie to watch which emotionally makes you chill and motivated at end .

Must watch . Highly recommended .",9
16 July 2009,Gus van Sant Gets Sappy,"Every once in a while, director Gus van Sant gets sappy, and movies like ""Good Will Hunting"" are the result.

The director of terrific films like ""To Die For"" and ""Paranoid Park"" is nowhere in evidence in this story about a math phenom (Matt Damon) working as a janitor while a bunch of dumber and richer kids get all the good stuff life has to offer. Robin Williams plays a counselor, Minnie Driver plays a love interest and Ben Affleck plays a best friend. The film launched the careers of Affleck and Damon, who won an Oscar for writing the film's screenplay. But the screenplay is one of the worst things about the film, full of lines and speeches that maybe looked good on paper but aren't at all believable as things people would actually say in any version of reality I know.

Not a bad movie, but not one I'd waste any more time on, and certainly wildly overrated.

Grade: B",6
21 June 2001,"Good film, but predictable. Driver shines.","A pretty good film. Several things at the end were utterly predictable. Robin Williams is so much better when he goes low-key, like here. I was very impressed with Minnie Driver's performance, something I haven't seen much mention of. (Although I haven't read all five gazillion comments) She really nailed it here. Damon and Affleck were OK. The script was good, but I don't think it was any better than ""As Good as it Gets"" also nominated that year. (I haven't seen the other two nominees) One thing I liked was that the actors at least attempted the Boston accent. I suppose to a Yankee, it would seem uneven, but at least they tried. I hate films set in Boston, or New York, or Georgia, where everybody sounds like they're from L.A. Grade: B

30 March 1999,Thought provoking,"This movie will always have a special place in my heart.

Maybe it is because it was the last movie I saw together with my seven year long girl-friend before we split...

Maybe it is because I am on my way of becoming a psychotherapist for children and adolescents just like Robin Williams is in this movie...

Or maybe it is just because it is a damn good movie with brilliant actors Williams, Damon and Affleck.

I loved nearly every minute of it. The characters were complex and very realistic, and the inner conflict of Matt Damon was so strongly played you could actually see it in the air.

24 September 2001,refreshingly different,"Good Will Hunting is one movie that makes reaffirms your faith in hollywood. thank heavens for matt damon & ben affleck. one of the most refreshing & original movies in a long time. a movie that keeps its own pace and explores the psychology of the characters or rather the key character here - will hunting.

matt damon as will hunting is excellent, and the same goes for ben affleck & minnie driver - but veteran robin williams steals the show as the psychiatrist trying to bring the best out of will hunting and guiding him towards the light.

the authors do a credible job in making the chracters believable and lovable. one of the best screenplays in a long time.

a solid 9.

9 May 2020,"Great, but could've been better.","Everything psychology related is very well written, this movie has amazing inspirational dialogues. Sadly, the protagonist is dissapointing, the character can't choose anything by himself, plays by other people's infulence. I understand it's about character development, but he was a very crappy character to begin with.

5 June 2005,"As long as you realize there are LOTS of errors in the movie, it is entertaining","This movie got lots of kudos when it came out and most of them were deserved. The acting is exceptional and in some ways the writing is fine as well. However, given my background as an individual therapist, the movie is a mess psychologically speaking. First, although I generally like Robin Williams in the movie, his physical attack on the main character (though deserved) would result in him losing his license. I have felt like hitting many clients--particularly sociopaths like Will but it just can't occur in real life--particularly since a guy like Will would also be the type to make sure the police and licensing board found out ASAP! Second, given that Will is a sociopath (he has all the signs of an Antisocial Personality), he would not be cured by the end of the flick. Many therapists feel that antisocials cannot be successfully treated while those who DO feel treatment will help would never think about doing short-term therapy with such a vicious powder keg. The movie is pretty good but the sappy Hollywood ending ruins the movie and gives the general public very unrealistic expectations about therapy.",5
15 December 2006,"good God, good Will....","Over-praised melodrama of a gifted math-whiz who loves to flaunt his gift, but when approached about it, plays it off with an annoying ""Don't bother me"" attitude. After a street fight, the whiz (grumpy Damon) is actually given exemption from sentencing, provided that he dazzle a teacher as to why he's so good with numbers. The kid is so closed off that he's actually remanded to counseling with a hot-shot shrink to help open him up. The rest is a dull exchange of dialogue over several sessions until (lo and behold) the kid opens up and becomes a better person. Yay. Another one of those ""realism"" scripts, where they think the F-bomb dropped every other word is effective character building. Please. Plus some painfully forced macho moments, such as Damon spouting an endless deluge of analysis on the art of the pick-up, and his lackluster taunting of a rival. ""Do you like apples? I got her phone number. How do you like those apples?"" Congrats, gasbag, you got some flat-chested Englishwoman's phone number. Someone call the Smithsonian. Rent ""Good Will Humping"" instead.

20 September 2022,One of the most beautiful movie,"I Watched this movie this year and I found it amazingly beautiful. It ages so well and I love Robin Williams and Matt Damon in this film. Usually, this type of movies is not my cup of tea BUT I watched in math class with everyone and I really enjoyed this movie.

I think that I really loved this movie because the relationship between Will and Sean is very special and I felt like it was a really friendly relationship. I also loved Will's character development throughout the whole movie thanks to Sean. Cinematography is on point too specially the scene when they are sitting in front of the lake.

To recap, I think this movie is a ""must watch""

19 January 2021,Wholesome AF,"Yeah this is better than an alright movie. The casting is excellent, every character plays their role so extremely well and gives of such an emotional performance, especially Matt Damon. There are so many wise words as well that work so excellently throughout, there is so many hidden meanings in this movie. The romance side of the story, I found to be the lowest part of the movie, it was interesting enough but I preferred the teachings of Robin Williams character and seeing his chemistry with Will. I also thought there was going to be more about how incredibly smart Will was, which don't get me wrong there was, but there were other focuses that stood out. This movie is what me and my friends like to call an insta-classic, it well...instantly becomes a classic, pretty self explanatory. It truly is a heartwarming story with great characters, you can't go wrong. 9/10

24 April 2022,"Hollywood's romanticized view of academia or the myth of the ""natural-born genius""","Recently, I watched Good Will Hunting (1997) starring Matt Damon and Robin Williams. Overall, the acting was well-executed, with all actors delivering solid performances. In particular, Matt Damon shone in his role, while Robin Williams convincingly portrayed the empathic psychoanalyst. The cinematography was unremarkable but didn't detract from the story.

However, I found the script problematic. It contained many harmful messages typical of 1990s Hollywood and pretended to be realistic while promoting a false moral. My criticism focuses on the character of Will and his storyline. The main issue was the unrealistic portrayal of Will's genius, from his exaggerated arrogance to his sudden mastery of complex subjects like mathematics and chemistry. The movie implied that his genius was innate rather than the result of dedicated study and practice, which is unrealistic. For instance, in one scene, Will compares himself to Beethoven and Mozart, implying that they were able to play without any practice. This message is incorrect because both Beethoven and Mozart devoted countless hours to perfecting their craft. The fact that Will can excel at subjects so different and far away as Mathematics and Chemistry can't be a gift of nature. The only way to achieve this level of expertise is through practice and study. How can Will, a very young kid that spends his nights at the bar and his days on construction site, know more than a professor that has dedicated his life to the subject? Throughout the movie we are never shown Will studying or exercising or practicing Mathematics.

It's necessary to go through formal learning to understand Mathematics. In this movie, however, an extremely genius teenager easily freestyles the field of Mathematics. In a dialogue, Professor Lambeau examines the work of the genius boy, and says: ""I see you used Maclaurin here."" And Will replies: ""Yeah, I don't know what you call it, but..."". This is pure manipulation. The writers of this film deceive the uneducated audience giving a perception of Mathematics so far away from what it really is. I'm not saying people can't excel at something without a college education, but fields like Mathematics and Chemistry require countless hours of practice, complicated instruments and laboratories (especially for Chemistry). In a later scene Will conquers the young girl solving her Chemistry problem, showing apparently better skills at Chemistry than a pre-med student. Finally, I didnt really like either the ludicrous and totally out of touch way the university world was represented.

I know very little about Psychology, but I'm wondering if the way Damon and Affleck have dealt with this topic could be as accurate as the way they approached Mathematics. The movie suggested that all traditional psychologists are incompetent and that a special, unconventional psychologist was needed to treat Will's problems. What really surprised me, however, was the way Will's problem was solved suddenly in a single scene (very well acted by the two leads, I have to admit). However, psychological problems are not solved easily and quickly, as the movie suggests. It takes a lot of time, effort, and often involves relapses. Psychology is not magic.

A better comparison to this movie would be A Beautiful Mind (2001), which portrayed mathematics and psychology more realistically. It conveyed the message of overcoming difficulties with dedication and commitment, while Good Will Hunting portrayed genius as a magical gift.

By contrast, Good Will Hunting approaches these same topics in a way that feels closer to the fantasy world of Harry Potter. How to explain the acclaim this movie receives? The public likes stories about aberration and Will is aberrant, to the point that it seems like magic to a normal person who struggled through calculus in high school. The public likes the idea that humans can diverge from normal development so much that it seems superhuman. I can appreciate this concept in a fantasy or super hero movie, but I found it off-key in this movie. All in all I found the portrayal of genius and psychology in this movie unrealistic and misleading.",5

""Well, how'd ya like DEM APPLES!"" Wow, that IS genius.

13 September 2006,"First Script, Brilliant, the wonder-boys, Ben and Matt.","I was just starting to write stories, scripts, in my spare time. I wanted to get the form down, so for me, just writing was an exercise in itself. I was putting together a rather simple, down and out story nothing special. Writing in early 97'.

I had heard a story on how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had put this script together and had 'shopped' it all over Hollywood and were both kind of ready to sell it, even for a 'piece of chicken' (Jokingly they said in an interview) but they were sort of at their wits'-end when....- it finally happened.

Then, look what happened...2 Oscars, 16 other awards and 34 nominations on top of that! Why? Two reasons I can find. First off, they did not give up, or give in to the temptation to finally quit. The other, and this is just a 'shot in the dark' but, the movie was victorious. No, arguments can truly take solid ground against the film, other than yes, they had an affinity for the 'F'-word.

These 'Southies' were really playing the 'streeters' of Boston to steely perfection. They were who they set out to be in their writing. I was amazed, this story touched deeply. they showed the struggle and the belief in and they all sort of had a love for their 'Brilliant' janitor friend, knowing that he is destined for more than they were going to encounter in life. And they still stood up for him and with him on everything from street fights to getting him in the end to embrace what he needed to do and follow and not fear the great task ahead of him. The biggest thing for me in this story is the element of distrust, that came from Matt's Character. He was abused by his dad and through that impact that started the massive down-slide (avalanche) of destructive behavior and thoughts of uselessness in himself. He was almost brought to a place that he might not return, as he didn't feel that he could love or give anything to Skyler, because he was scared of love itself. What should have been there at his childhood home (love) was abandoned to an evil overlord that was nothing more than a 'liability' to his life and personal growth. His biological father became a 'bully' worse than any kid at school on the playground.

They even brought back some classic seventies tunes that I had forgotten for years, I enjoyed the way that they, placed the music in the different sequences, it was just right. To boot, Matt's character needs to keep the !! Skylar loved him, and he would eventually learn to love other than what he had known before, new and more openly.

When the movie ended I was no less than blown away. As a matter of fact I got scared. I was so intimidated, that I stopped writing. Than I heard about the Oscar wins. Robin's first I think it was. And the other wins and nominations and I thought, after a while later, if I quit, I may miss having something to offer to my friends and family, maybe even this country. So I looked at their example and remembered what I took away from the movie and put it back together again for myself.

This one is an inspiration all around. This was a winner through and through! It may have been crass and vulgar and just slightly violent, but that just identified the plot of the story as it got going.

They deserved every award that they received.

This goes beyond just movie for me, it's not as some have been merely entertainment, but it strikes me like life does sometimes, even when God wants to get through to us. We just need to listen and then do the 'right' thing. But we have to follow through for anything good to happened.

I recommend this Gus Van Sant, directed and gifted film highly.

1 February 2021,This movie has so many memorable scenes that I can hardly keep count of them,"As an aspiring cinephile I've seen plenty of movies from different countries and periods but rarely do I see a movie with as many unforgettable moments as ''Good Will Hunting''. I've spent half an hour re-reading lines from the movie after it was over and God, in terms of message and things to say Gus Van Sant has created the perfect opposite of the usual ''empty shell'' kind of movie. This film has a strong voice to be heard by anyone, especially by people who have a hard time in their life right now.

The truth is I have no complaint . Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck top-notch performance. Brilliant script. Thought-provoking. Engaging. Genuine. Funny.

Maybe it's a bit slow sometimes but doesn't matter, because it's worth it every second in the end.

A 9,90 out of 10 from me.",9
12 March 1999,"Cliched, unreal, predictable and manipulative","I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're ""supposed"" to sob -- or at least feel ""touched"". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly ""It's not your fault"" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think Titanic; Yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. I guess I simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.

Folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal. Worse yet, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams' character is all cliched.

I gave it 1 out of 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just quite mediocre... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so I figured a single balancing vote won't hurt.",1
10 January 1999,no hope for Hollywood,"Good Will Hunting could have been an average movie, but it's nothing more than a ($%#)... bad movie. there is nothing you can relate to, it is full of cliche's ... Mat Damon is an awful actor (may be acceptable in some C-production 'hi-school-reunion-kids-got-drunk-movie'). screenplay... well he had an idea... initially - when he was (they were) around page 2 or 3 of the script... and than he took a $4.95 or so 'Screenplay for dummies'... if he didn't do that - this may be almost average movie. this way it is AWFULL and overrated... Robin Williams... Robin... oh the guy who acts 'dead poet's society' each time he sees the camera? even if it is the camera in the K-Marts.... don't mention it

29 May 2009,"Great Performance By Damon, But The Movie As A Whole Was A Bit Of A Drag","Matt Damon was great. There's no doubt about that. His performance as Will Hunting - a genius who just doesn't fit into society and ends up as a janitor at MIT instead of a student - was fabulous, and made the movie worth watching. Unfortunately I personally didn't think there was much else fabulous about this. The story was modestly interesting, and the viewer certainly does want to know what eventually happens to Will. The ending was, strangely, both appropriately and unfortunately ambiguous, as Will leaves behind an opportunity to ""make it"" in order to pursue love. I say ""appropriately"" because the lack of resolution seemed to fit with the rest of his life, and ""unfortunately"" because it left me with no clear knowledge of what happened to him. The movie also raises valid questions about what it means to ""fit in."" Will didn't, because he wasn't doing what everyone thought he should do with his life, but - on the other hand - maybe that was just Will. Do we have to fit into a preconceived notion of what we should be doing? Fair question.

So, there was a lot of good stuff in the actual story. Now, I know this is a minority opinion, but I wasn't take with the rest of the cast: Steven Skarsgard as the professor who discovers Will and tries to mold him, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend from South Boston (who co-wrote the movie with Damon), Minnie Driver as Skylar - Will's burgeoning love interest, and Robin Wiliams as the counsellor who helps Will confront some of his past demons. None of them were bad, but they also didn't really grab hold of me. Frankly, I also found the movie dragged dreadfully at times and at a little over two hours was a bit too long as a result. Damon's standout performance helps this get a 4/10.",4
17 January 2022,I won't spend much time as I doubt anyone will read this...,"But I just wanted to say that I am blown away that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this while they were still 'relatively' young guys and given the depth this movie touches on, I was thoroughly impressed. The direction by Gus Van Sant was also obviously excellent. I am a bit surprised that Rachel Majorowski has only made this one movie because she was great, but then again, being an actor/actress is a tough gig so maybe she bowed out of Hollywood and if so I could not blame her one bit, but man, what a loss to the movie industry because she was great in this. I really liked everything about this film and what I liked most is that it was believable which I find most movies are not.

Kudos to everyone involved. You all did a GREAT job.

22 November 2022,What a great movie it is,"Good Will Hunting absolutely deserves the label ""Timeless Classic"" and with very good reasons: the movie not only asks the viewers to question the importance that high-education provides in a society in which the elite thrive but also to ask the same very basic question that Sean Robin Williams asks Will Matt Damon

""What do you want?""

With fantastic storyline-progression, real humanperformances and dialog which will remain etched in your mind forever make no mistake: you can watch this movie in any year and in any time and it will still have the same impact.

""How do you like them apples?"" will be a rhetorical question you can't wait to use after you watch this. As the final shot ends with a car on a highway and the credits start to roll, you will be both satisfied at the ending while sad that the movie itself is over.

The writing is quite brilliant with a perfect mix of humour and drama which conveys the story perfectly. The performances are incredible and the relationship created by Damon and Williams is fantastic. The Affleck brothers and Minnie Driver, also add a great dynamic to this film. This film will be sure to make you laugh, cry and think about the world in ways that you may not have before. Get watching gang!

27 December 2022,Genius yet broken - A redemption story,"Good Will hunting is a story about a man who comes from a poor background but has an extraordinary brain. The movie takes you through the redemption arc of this broken character who despite being a genius and being given an opportunity to improve his life, keeps on self sabotaging in order to push away people. The movie no doubt deserve the praise and hype that it gets from the ones who have already watched it.

Since the movie is a cinematic classic and is often cited as a reference for how therapy should be done, I had some idea of what to expect. While I would have preferred it to be a little more like ""The pursuit of happyness"" or ""Forest Gump"" since that is my preferred genre, I must say that it did not disappoint. The movie does not have generic motivational scenes that are expected out of a movie which is trying to showcase a redemption story, scenes like the underdog feeling down and eventually getting up on their feet but what it lacks in the motivational aspect it makes up for it by discussing the existential element and really makes people think and self introspect.

One of my absolute favorite scenes is when Sean (The therapist) tells Will(Matt Damon) that it's not his fault that his life is so messed up and to that Will reply that he knows, after that Sean repeated the same thing that its not his fault and Will replied that he knows but Sean kept on repeating the same thing and it is then when we see that the smug guy who has been tough throughout the movie starts crying like a little baby as if that's exactly the validation he needed. This scene made me tear up a bit as well.

In conclusion, an amazing movie to watch, It might not motivate you to immediately get out of bed and start doing work if you are having a gloomy day but nevertheless it does help in lightening up your mood and gives a very powerful message - ""Acceptance is the only way forward"".",9

6 April 1999,Over-rated,"This is undeniably a character-driven film, and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more if the eponymous character was a little more realistic. Matt Damon clearly knew he would be playing Will Hunting- he and co-writer Ben Affleck crafted a self-indulgent character that actors dream about. First of all, he's great looking. Secondly, he's wild and rebellious. Thirdly- and best of all- he's a genius! Any flaws in the character are created only to give Damon opportunity to display himself as an actor. Robin Williams is totally uninteresting- how'd he get an Oscar? And Minnie Driver- why is this woman an actress? Had this movie been written by someone with any sense of character, it could have been great; as it stands, it's barely good. (Gee- a closing line almost as cute as the movie's title!)

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9
25 January 2001,The Barroom Debate Scene,"Thank God for Jay Mohr and the short lived series Action. At least they had the courage to directly, on-the-air, from other Hollywood players, lambaste this monstrosity of a

script that went all the way to the Oscar's!

Bad scripts come and go. Just part of life. Giving them Oscars as Best Screenplay is criminal. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are fine human beings and good looking guys living great lives. They just can't write to save them, that's all.

The barroom debate scene between the snooty student and the self educated Damon is merely the most pretentious and stupid scene EVER to portray itself as having any connection to reality whatsoever. Why didn't it get THAT Oscar?

This awful film was a top ten grossing movie in 1997. That's the really scary part. This bad a film does that well. And it's not an action flick, it pretends to be an intellectual flick with an important message! As you read this, if you didn't see the gruesome falseness of the barroom debate scene, just remember that your really dwelling some place far out, but nowhere in the real world. I bet you liked Blair Witch.

A very distant second in the removed-from-reality category could be Jason Robarbs in the ""senior partners take a shower together scene"" in Philadelphia. But that's not really close to this masterwork. One can also think of the Happy Days episode where Fonzie and Richie go to a snooty rich people's party and are treated so badly. Another worthy contender. Several episodes of The White Shadow perhaps? James At Sixteen? I'll wager young Matt and Damon loved those shows!

The bar is set. That barroom debate scene may not be the worst thing ever filmed. But it is certainly the most intellectually pretentious and cloyingly stupid scene ever made. No surprise to finding Robin Williams in this film. How did he let them leave him out of this scene? Oversight.",

20 August 2022,Even the title is inspiring,"As I said, even the title is inspiring and meaningful.

It's a masterpiece, I love it. This type of films with this level of quality are so so rare.

Everything about this film is wonderful especially its screenplay which was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

If it wasn't released on 1997 -the year that Titanic was released- it could have won all the Oscars which was nominated for.

The most important aspect of this great film is all those moral messages.

There are a lot of talks that you can find in this film that can be so powerfully and emotionally connected and relevant to you, and inspire and enlighten you.

8.5/10.",9
29 January 2007,imperfect but highly watchable and well-made,"Absorbing and thought-provoking story from director Gus Van Sant about a brilliant but deeply troubled young man. Damon, in a strong, credible performance, is Will Hunting, a feckless, bellicose native of South Boston with a genius IQ and an aptitude for mathematics even though he spends his days getting into legal troubles with his buddies and working as a janitor at an upscale university. When a renowned professor discovers this, he sends Will to the only person who can get through to him: maverick psychologist Williams, who has his own emotional baggage. From a screenplay by actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck the film isn't always on target, especially with an abundance of profane dialogue, but it holds you throughout and benefits from rock solid performances. ***

16 September 1999,"Um, hello, to everyone who did not like this movie..what's not to like about it??","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve our utmost sincerity and appreciation for writing a brilliant script. Robin Williams gives one of the best performances of his career! Matt & Ben were well deserving of their Oscar for the script , as was Robin for his supporting award. This movie should have gotten more Oscars than it did. Watching Will and how hard his life has been was a real eye opener for me, I realized how much he and I had in common. Matt Damon playing this role allowed me to view my own life and allow me to forgive some people. So, thank you Matt for your inspirational role. Minnie Driver was brilliant as well in her role, she was way better than Kim Basinger , and she should have gotten the Oscar. Bravo to everyone involved in this film! Absolutely brilliant in every way...

22 November 1998,please - DON'T get carried away in the hype!,"Oh please. What was the hype with this movie? It was yet more formulaic, contrived, saccharine, vacuous tripe.

Many comments seem to refer to how 'moving' it was - a reference to the film's overly effusive pouting. What ever happened to subtlety?

And why go for such 'authentic' language in such an unrealistic film which never gains any credibility outside something being shot in a Hollywood studio?

And this features so highly on the top 250 list??? Ye gods, watch some films which manage to genuinely convey some emotions a little closer to the world we live in.

2 April 2019,The realism and authenticity is unbelievable,"Today I am ending my birthday on a high by reviewing my all time favourite movie. Good Will Hunting Directed by Gus Van Sant, contains such an incredible screenplay written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The plot is simply based on a genius who isn't living to his potential due to the traumatic impact of his past. For a topic which has been attempted countless times in film history, Good Will Hunting still holds the benchmark. Each and every word of the script is perfection. Moments of outrage as well as moments of therapy contain some of the most well written lines in cinema. Robin Williams' performance was truly inspiring. His line delivery has a way of transcending the screen and connecting with the audience on a deep, emotional level. I say this is my favourite film due to the fact that it is talented film making in its barest form. All that is required is a great script and talented performances, in order to create such a timeless film. This movie holds up incredibly well. Age hasn't made it less powerful or emotionally outdated. This is one of the very few films which actually impacted my personal life and changed my mindset. The bleak visuals together with Elliot Smith's melancholy music, establishes such a beautiful, sorrowful tone throughout the entire runtime. Not once do I ever believe I am watching a film whilst sitting through Good Will Hunting. The realism and authenticity is unbelievable. If you haven't seen Good Will Hunting, you're currently deprived from one of the greatest films in history. This film repeatedly leaves me in awe each and every time I experience it. Good Will Hunting is undoubtably a 10. I recommended reading through screenplay after watching the film. It's an absolute masterpiece.",10
14 February 1999,Detestable film about the strange people with brains.,"Don't spend the entire time while you read this review catching my mistakes and defaming me. It won't change anything. I have an IQ of 140. Not extraordinary, but not so bad either. This is how intelligent people are represented in our society. Every film one sees about this subject touts the virtues of the retard, and deprecates and misrepresents the smart. The ultimate example of this stuff, The Mighty, last year's film starring Sharon Stone tells the story of her son (in the movie), who is a sickly boy who will soon outgrow his bones. His organ will be too large for the space between the bones and he'll die. And he does. The only mitigating factor is that he meets a boy his age who is all muscle and no brains. Together with this boy Stone's son can get about. It's like the old joke ""Well, I'm the bum whole and if I shut down operations, you'll all be in torture, including you stupid brain! This movie Good Will Hunting is like so many movies from the kind of people who have given us things like child protection services, repressed memories suits, the abuse excuse in court, etc. America lives in an orgy of equalization, destroying everything and anything that looks better, let along outstanding. In a word intelligent people are all inbalanced and a constant problem. Only a mildly retarded social worker can help them.",1
16 October 2011,Liking these apples,"When people have a hidden talent, or can do something that very few other people can, they tend to show it off or even brag about it. Not the case in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a closet-genius who works as a janitor at the prestigious College MIT. He spends his days mopping hallways, and solving complicated math problems outside on the chalkboard.

Will spends most of his time with friends Chuckie (Affleck), Billy (Hauser), and Morgan (Casey Affleck), but once they all get in another fight on a basketball court, Professor Gerald Lambeau (Skarsg√•rd) from MIT says that he must look into seeing a therapist and agree to study mathematics at MIT. Will agrees, and after a few failed therapists an aging man named Sean (Williams) is called in to help Will overcome his struggles.

On the side note, Will meets a girl named Skylar (Driver) at a bar, and after a while they begin seeing each other. The problem is Will keeps pushing away at her, when really, he should be pulling closer.

The script, written by actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, is outstanding and certain monologues are so well written and originally acted that they rank up there with some of the dialog scenes from a Kevin Smith film. Ironically, both Affleck and Damon appeared in Dogma two years later reciting the same amazing dialog, only this time, by Kevin Smith.

Certain scenes where Sean is telling his life-story to Will are lengthy, but you never see the film lose your attention. Good Will Hunting is a rarity in story and in story-telling. And having two amazing youths write a script so advanced and so powerful just is the icing on the cake.

If there's anything the film lacks is its scenes with Affleck and Damon. Both create amazing chemistry on screen, and when brought together show off creative dialog, intense arguments, and shocking realism. The final dialog scene between the boys takes place at a construction site, where both the boys work. Chuckie tells Will that it would be an insult to the other workers here if he was still here in twenty years. Chuckie can't understand why someone like Will wouldn't want to show off his smarts, and I think I kind of sympathize with Will on that note.

When someone posses a talent in something they don't always want to show it. I know a number of people who are very good at a different variety of things, but none willing to show off their true potential. For me, I always want to show people what I can do, and am afraid of saying some things because I worry that they will get the wrong idea about me. I always want to show everyone my true abilities, and what makes up someone like me. But in Will's case, he doesn't want to do that for comfort purposes.

Good Will Hunting is authentic and rare. It's a film where almost everything is powerful and everything is so well done. The theme of ""self-worth"" is discussed in frequent films, but here, it is discussed stronger and with more heart than many films. It's a gem, shining stronger in places where others don't even show a glare.

Starring: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Cole Hauser, and Casey Affleck. Directed by: Gus Van Sant.",9
1 December 1998,What An Arrogant...,"This movie reeks of one thing....pure arrogance. The film communicates a very immature view on intelligence and success. Are we supposed to accept that since Ben Affleck's character isn't as smart as Matt Damon's, he should be satisfied with his lot in life where as Mr. Smarty Pants should claim his rightful place in the heirarchy of society? So, when some dumb kid sees this movie, he's suppost to say to himself, ""You know, I'm not as smart as Will. I'm more like his friend. So, I really shouldn't worry about succeeding in life. Like Ben Affleck's character, I should be happy working construction while my smart friend needs to get motivated and succeed."" Granted, the movie does not focus on this, but this theme is definitely present, and extractable. By the way, the math that genius Will does is quite simple. Matrices? MacLaurin series? come on. I learned that in high school and I'm no genius.

17 May 2010,Better late than never.,"It's a lonely feeling to finally watch such a popular and critically-acclaimed movie like Good Will Hunting, and be wondering what all the fuss was about. Sure it's been a few years since it was released, but movies this highly praised usually stand up to the test of time.

So I didn't think it was amazing...but it was good. It's the kind of underdog story that pulls at the heartstrings, and I imagine that a large portion of its popularity comes from that fact. Matt Damon is just a great actor in every movie he ever does, Minnie Driver was aces, and Robin Williams made the rare decision to showcase the portion of his talent that doesn't make me want to slap him.

Good Will Hunting is a solid movie, and it's really a shame that it has taken me so long to see it. Solid, but not spectacular.

21 June 2020,A classic film about self-discovery,"If you have not seen Good Will Hunting(1997), it is probably the defining film about the road to self discovery.

A troubled young man with an incredibly brilliant mind, Will Hunting(played by Matt Damon) has to meet with a psychologist named Shawn(played by Robbin Williams) who in turn helps him try to open up and be himself. At the same time, a prestigious math professor wants Will to be the brilliant man he wishes he was. The dialogue and acting in this movie is fantastic. There are so many defining scenes in the movie.

The whole film basically revolves along realized potential and finding your way in life. There is one scene in a bar between the math professor and the psychologist that seemed to define the whole movie for me.

Overall one of my favorite films.",9
13 February 2006,"Well done, but ""Finding Forrester"" was even better.","I would have given ""Good Will Hunting"" 10/10, but ""Finding Forrester"" outdid it (now ""GWH"" almost seems self-indulgent). The plot of course has the title character (Matt Damon) finding his way in life with the help of Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Stellan Skarsgard also do quite well in their roles. I'll never forget Williams's comment when he accepted his Oscar (""Thank you Ben and Matt. I still want to see some ID."") Like so many other movies (pretty much every one except the illogical ""Gerry""), this certainly shows Gus Van Sant to be a great director. If this movie had any bad sides, it was that it paved the way for Ben Affleck starring in ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" (not to mention the whole ""Ben and Jen"" thing; thank God that's over with).

31 March 2020,Best movie I've ever watched. It's a master piece.,"Performance delivery that does the thoroughly-planned and meticulous screen writing justice. The narrative captures the struggles of morality, relationships and mental health, as the movie follows the development of an inert young man. An amazing exploration of society's demands and their effects on how we view people to shape the world. A must see.

22 February 1999,"Liked it, didn't love it","I'm not one of the people who said, ""Wow, this is the best movie I've ever seen!"", but I did like it a lot. I think the reason I didn't love it is I thought the conflict between the Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard characters was somewhat exaggerated for dramatic purposes, and I didn't always buy it. I did like the relationships between the other characters, especially between the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck characters. My favorite moment in the movie is Affleck's speech to Damon where he tells him his favorite part of the day is when he thinks Damon isn't there. And Williams was really good.

7 November 2010,Very Emotional Drama!,"Good Will Hunting is just a very great drama from the late 90's I believe if it was not for Titanic, this movie would have swept the Oscars. This movie did deserve to win the screenplay award. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really wrote a fine script.

This is about some hotshot kid who is always getting into trouble. It's up to some psychology professor to change the ways of the kid or else he will be spending time in jail.

This is the first serious movie I have seen that featured Robin Williams. He did a very good job and I was impressed. Matt Damon is likable in any movie he's in. Ben Affleck did a decent job as well.

There are some powerful scenes that may have people in tears. There is plenty of cursing but it works with the film.

Overall, this is a great drama and I will watch it again. I rate this film 9/10.",9
9 December 2019,One of the best movies ever,"How anyone saw this as a 1/10 FLOORS me! They must be emotionally dead! This movie had so many nuances that I've seen this at least 10 times and I see something new each time!! Robin Williams , IMHO, IS what makes this movie so very special. He resonates love and care for human beings. He's NOT driven by his ego, tho he was god enough to be. Enjoy this beautiful film. I certainly did . 10/10

28 May 2005,"Impressive, if just a bit predictable","This is the writing debut of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yep. They wrote this movie. I had a hard time believing it when I read it, too. Something that made it easier to believe what that I read in the trivia section that they originally wrote it as more of a Hollywood-like film, with government conspiracies and such. Luckily, they were advised to drop everything but the core drama. The result is this very interesting and thoroughly entertaining film. The story of one young man with vast, unused talent. Like many other dramas, this is based primarily in the dialog and the characters. Some of the most interesting scenes in the film are those where you see the interaction, the conversations between Damon and Williams. They play off each other very nicely. Gus Van Sant's fairly vague and undistinguished directorial style fits the story well, and I really enjoyed the usage of the cameras in the fight scene early in the film. The film has plenty of clever writing, mainly noticeable in the dialog. The plot is very good. The pacing is mostly good, though the film gets a tad slow every once in a while. Near the end I felt like it could have been shorter without hurting the film. The acting is all top-notch, though some of the dialects could have used a bit more work. Something that bothered me a bit about the end was how inconclusive and yet Hollywood-like it was. We don't really know what happens to Will Hunting after the film... but we get the feeling that he's going to be fine. I prefer the ending to 8 Mile, which was a good bit more ambiguous. In the end, a pretty good writing debut, and a solid directing effort by Van Sant. I recommend this to fans of dramas and the various names involved in it. 8/10",8

3 February 2001,"A debut - a little immature, but okay","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, two good friends, as we all know, presented their first screenplay. It's about ¬ñ not them but guys similar to them: young, intelligent, but very insecure concerning their future. I guess, this is how many script debuts are like. Luckily, they found some good actors with Minnie Driver and Robin Williams and a famous director, so they managed to make a solid movie that doesn't get boring and makes you think about life. It's a small film, with no particular peculiarites (except the fact that Will is a maths genius, a fact that doesn't dominate the film as much as I believed before I saw it). This makes it even more remarkable to me that it became so successful and won two Oscars. 6 stars out of 10.

19 September 2021,Too sentimental,"Interesting topic for a story but I found it bogged down with sentiment veering into sappiness. Robin Williams tries his best here but the story is too long and too slow paced and bored me before long. It also put me off watching another Matt Damon film for five years or so.

20 October 2008,Blue-Collar Boston's Diamond in the Rough,"This movie celebrates the unsung hero but beyond that, it challenges us to cast aside stereotypes and see the diamond in the rough. In that sense, it follows the Frank Capra tradition of exalting the forgotten people in our own midst.

The main plot is about a young man named Will Hunting who works as a janitor at MIT but in his blue collar world, there is a genius lurking. The sub-plot involving two academic rivals ‚Äì Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard ‚Äì is about the struggle between two strong personalities to decide the best way to help Will.

Will suffers from a background of being shuffled from one foster home to another and this leads to behavior that regularly lands him in trouble. He is discovered by a professor, Gerald Lambeau, played by Skarsgard, who himself has been honored for outstanding academic achievement. Lambeau seeks out his long-time rival, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to be the youth's therapist ‚Äì a court-mandated requirement to get Will out of a possible prison sentence and to get him on track to achieve the tremendous success Lambeau feels he is capable of.

The rivalry between the two professors takes on tremendous significance for Will's future. Lambeau sees potential waiting to be unleashed and Maguire sees the wounded human soul, who needs to be rescued before he releases him into the world.

Will finds love in a young university woman named Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, who clearly sees the broken man with a big heart, who is a latent genius. Skylar is a natural with Will and his friends, despite the fact that they exist in different worlds. When Skylar decides to pursue her dreams in California, she asks Will to go with her. She loves him deeply but because of a deep-seated fear he might be hurt or betrayed, Will cannot bear to leave the world he knows with the friends he trusts. His friends are Chuck Sullivan, (Ben Affleck) Morgan O'Mally, (brother Casey Affleck) and Billy McBride (Cole Hauser).

Will's fate is more or less decided at a critical moment in the movie with his therapist and is reinforced by his girlfriend Skylar and his friend Chuckie ‚Äì both believe in him and care deeply for him. This movie is the result of collaboration between Damon and Affleck. They wrote and produced the movie, drawing on their Boston roots to show the hardscrabble existence of the blue-collar Irish in South Boston (Southie) with poverty and street fighting. The movie is directed by Gus Van Sant, who directed the movie Elephant. The foul language is somewhat jarring but serves to make the movie an accurate portrayal.

This movie shows the gap between the blue-collar workers and the university people in the same city but in that setting two strong-willed men try to help a young man from the wrong side of town.",8
22 November 1998,Please...,"This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.

And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.

Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.

20 March 1999,Almost lives up to the hype,"Despite some annoying flaws, I would still have to call this a great movie. I didn't at all mind that the film was a little far-fetched. Instead, what bothered me was that the scenes that were supposed to be the most emotionally charged did nothing for me. Considering how effective the movie usually was, it was very irritating to have a couple of scenes that didn't seem to work. But it was still a great movie, thanks in large part to a generally solid script and terrific acting by everyone involved, especially Robin Williams, who should give up comedies entirely, since he's such a tremendous talent when given a dramatic part. This film isn't the instant classic that many have built it up to be, but it is still a really good film that is definitely worth seeing.

16 May 2023,One of the Best Ever,"I've probably watched this movie at least five times over the years including last weekend. And it's just as good as it was the first time.

Matt Damon isn't one of my favorite actors but he's superb here as a troubled, uneducated math prodigy Will Huntin. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, probably best known as Dr. Erik Selvig in the Marvel movies, was so good as the math Professor who discovers a math prodigy (Damon) that he hopes to use to propel himself back in the highest math circles.

But Robin William stole the movie as the therapist, Dr. Sean Maguire, that his college 'friend', Selvid asks to help Will Hunting. The character growth of both Will and Sean as we learn more about their past made me cry the first time I watched this movie.

4 April 2020,Analysis/Opinion A story that anybody can relate to that compares personal achievements with the acceptance oneself and mediocrity.,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10

3 September 2000,An intelligent story,"This is a very intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT when he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department. Though the story is a bit far fetched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man.

Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT. This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy. He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing. The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale.

The screenplay was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for which they won an academy award (the film was nominated for nine). Both were considered promising young actors before this film, but this tied a rocket pack to their backs and lit the fuse. Damon was outstanding in the lead. He had a very complex character to play and his emotional range was phenomenal. Not only was he quick witted, charming and vibrant, but he also had to be hot headed, arrogant, confused and despondent. He was able to switch emotions with ease and was always intense and believable. Robin Williams also gave one of his better performances and received a best supporting Oscar.

It is hard not to like this film. Most of the challenges that Will faced were inside him, and watching him struggle to overcome the limitations from his past was very uplifting. I rated this film a 9/10. We need more scripts like this. Perhaps if we are lucky, Damon and Affleck will take time from their successful acting careers and collaborate again.",9

4 June 2023,An Incredibly Grounded and Captivating Story,"Good Will Hunting is quite an iconic film and the title was flung around in conversation, when discussing good films. Many people around me had raved about this film, but not mentioning the specific aspects of the film that was especially effective. So I was always curious and intrigued by this film, but honestly expecting to be a little underwhelmed, due to the ""hype"" created. However this film lived up to the high expectations I loved; the pacing of the storyline, the dynamic range of framing and compositions, and especially the character work.

Firstly, in terms of the acting in this film, the performances are especially effective, creating that authenticity and further drawing me into the storyline. Matt Damon portrayed his character; Will, very well, he explored all of the pain and the joy that character felt to such a high degree, to a point where it became the highlight of the scene. Often in a lot of scenes he had a dance partner, which was the character of Sean, played by the brilliant Robin Williams. Robin Williams masterfully created depth within his character, so that when his character had moments of comedy or pain there was meaning, integrity, and intention...

The character establishing is one of the great aspects of the story that helps in building the world the audience becomes temporarily immersed within. The audience throughout the film slowly gets to know the characters of Sean, played by Robin Williams, who have experienced great pain, but is so emotionally intelligent and truly cares for Will. Lambeau, who almost envies Will's talent, and wants to push him to a life of changing the future through academics. And another example, Chuckie, Will's best friend, knows he cannot escape his grueling reality, but wants the best for Will. Which leads me to another point which is the character development, especially in Will, him realizing his pain, his traumas, and growing as a person to the point where he could make a decision about his future.

In summary, this film was very impressive with its story being grounded and captivating throughout...",9
24 August 2003,I Don't Know What the Big Deal Was!,"This could be the most overrated film of all time, despite some good acting. For once, Robin Williams isn't annoying as psychologist who tries to get through to a boy genius with a bad attitude, who would rather work construction every day and drink beers w/his blue collar pals every night then get a high-paying job that puts his tremendous intelligence to use.

I really wanted to see this because SO many people told me I'd love it and I really didn't. I hope I'm not giving too much away but is the point of the movie: He had a huge chip on his shoulder because he was abused as a kid? I thought they said that 5 minutes into the movie but then it plays like some amazing revelation at the end. Big deal!! Lots of people are abused as children and DON'T grow up to be assholes.

19 October 2002,A Wonderful Film!,"The first time I saw this film I liked it, but I didn't realize how good it was. After a few more viewings I came to understand how great this film truly is. The story is very interesting and quite entertaining. The cast is excellent and the acting is very good. The comedy is very well done and well placed throughout the film. The only complaint I have about the film is the absurd amount of swearing in the film. I agree that sometimes it is necessary, but there is a truly unnecessary amount of language in the film. But please, don't let that discourage you from seeing the film, it is a very good film.

As I said above, the cast is excellent. Matt Damon pulls off one of his best performances so far in his career. Robin Williams does a fantastic job in this film and definitely deserved his Oscar! Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, and Stellan Skarsgard were all excellent supporting cast members!

I would definitely recommend this film, as long as you can deal with the swearing. If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Thanks for reading,

5 December 2022,Relatable for any young adult watching,"Good Will Hunting is one of those movies that seem so relatable yet so tragic at the same time. Will is a hidden genius that is so pretentious about his gifted knowledge. He uses it but doesn't want to because he has no goals to set about his knowledge. This says so much about Will, and in some circumstance, it says a lot about ourselves.

We probably have or will go through this phase where we don't know what we want to become of ourselves. After graduating college, then what? Like Will, we have all this knowledge but we don't have any direction in life. It's like we've become a waste of good talent. I can't tell you how emotional this movie hits me today.

29 February 2000,a masterpiece,"Good Will Hunting is an american movie classic. after i saw this movie i knew then and there i wanted to work in film. Matt Damon is amazing in this movie. he should have won for best actor at the oscars. it's a real good coming of age story about two best friends Damon and Affleck. the movie has real human emotion, and i must admit that the scene when Matt Damon broke down and cried i had tears in my eyes. a very moving film. Good Will Hunting should have gotten best picture, it's much better then Titanic. after seeing this movie Matt Damon and Ben Affleck became 2 of my favorite actors. now that they are so famous it's cool that they still remain best friends. i give Good Will Hunting 10/10

2 October 2018,"Well, damn","I'd been wanting to watch this movie forever, but I never felt like it was the right time. Yesterday however, I finally sat back to enjoy myself a nice movie with some of my favorite actors (Damon and Williams). I enjoyed it, but in a very different way from what I had expected. I went through a rollercoaster of emotions. I laughed, I cried (a lot), I got frustrated, and sooo much more. This was, for me, definitely the right time to watch this movie. It's mostly about finding yourself and what you want in life, and I think I really needed to hear many things that were said in the movie. It opened my eyes, and my mind and I already know that this movie's going to have a huge impact on the rest of my life.

I absolutely love everything about it. Without a doubt a movie everyone should watch at least once in their life.

11 July 2009,The Title Really Sums it Up (In a Dreadful Way),"I'm one of the few people not crazy about this movie. I always have this problem with older, iconic movies. It feels like I've seen this type of thing better before, but I'm never sure if that is because this movie started it. In the case of Good Will Hunting, it's kind of old, but not old enough to create the old clich√©s.

This is the story of a young, genius janitor, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who has issues. Growing up in south Boston is hard and all that, and Will was given a gift he didn't ask for, and a life that he's unnecessarily proud of. His little reality is shaken when he meets a psychologist (Robin Williams) who matches his life, and a woman (Minnie Driver) who matches his wit. And you get the dreadfully punny title, Good Will Hunting.

Maybe it's the pun that gets me off to a horrible start. The screenplay doesn't make me feel much better. It is filled with clich√©s. It seemed like every little life lesson was spelled out for you, as if you couldn't be trusted to distill it from the movie yourself. Every little thing Robin Williams says feels like a ridiculous monologue by an amateur. Which really is what this is. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote the screenplay, their first. I really have no idea why it won best screenplay at the Oscars.

The acting is very good, however. Ben Affleck isn't always convincing, but he's got that whole look and atmosphere of a hometown boy. Minnie Driver is spectacular. She really captures the emotional turmoil her character is put through. Gus Van Sant directed this film, and despite the simplistic dialogue that is put forward as the most important part of the movie, he rescues it. The silent parts are often the best, like when the boys ride back from Harvard, and soft Elliot Smith music plays. That was the first transcendental moment, and a few more follow, elevating the movie to a place it really wouldn't be otherwise. Although I had problems with the Elliot Smith-dominated sound track. Every time something was supposed to be touching, they played Elliot Smith. It was tiring and monotonous, and by the end, I could basically start singing the music before it came on.

It's not a bad movie, it's just rather corny, rather predictable, rather run-of-the-mill. I suppose that the story is a bit different, and showed people something they had not seen and considered. Matt Damon's character is a bit of an enigma, a genius who shies from his gifts, and the reason why he makes sense. It's a great character study. But his ""salvation"" from his self-designed fate, is commercial and forced, and makes too many decisions and judgments to be really great.",6
17 August 2000,Did I miss something?,"I don't get it. I rented the movie because it was supposed to be great. It was at best mediocre. Did it just appeal to people because they think they are really smart and have never expressed themselves, so they identify with some character who has an inherent knowledge of differential equations and sociology. Nothing was believable in this movie: the love, the pain, the character, or the premise. Ben Affleck's character was the only redeeming quality in the movie. Robin Williams did his worst acting job since Mork and Mindy. It was just a movie about a boy who lacked complexity and was ""wicked smart"".

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed.

21 May 2002,"A lot has been said about Good Will Hunting. Everything from movie of the year, to a yawner. I would put it somewhere in the middle.","Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a young man from Boston who is brilliant, but also a troublemaker. He has a gift, something that he could use to get out of the down-trodden life he lives, but he's afraid, of his gift, and of leaving what he knows. But when as part of his probation for assaulting a police officer, he is released into the care of an M.I.T. professor, he has to face his fears face on. This is done with his psychologist, played by Robin Williams. For me, the movie came alive when Williams showed up. Up until that point, it was well done, but basic. Williams has the ability in his movies to either totally take control of a scene, or to sit back and play off the other actors (I can't wait for Insomnia.) I know he's generally seen as a comedic actor, but he's one of the few that can also pull of a serious role (again, I can't wait for Insomnia.) After he meets Will, he sort of meets his match. After losing his wife to cancer, he went into his own shell, staying with what he knew, what was safe. But while he teaches Will to meet his fears head on, Will also teaches him a few things.

Once again, the plot is somewhat predictable. When Williams' character says early on that he skipped Game 6 of the World Series because he had to see about a woman, you knew that line would come back later on, and it did. The thing that makes this movie worthwhile, was the performance of Williams. I know everyone is talking about Matt Damon being the next big thing, and the script he and friend and co-star Ben Affleck wrote, is strong. But the person that carries the film, in my mind, is Robin Williams. And having Minnie Driver in the movie doesn't hurt (my bias for beautiful women comes through again). So even though you can guess what's going to happen next, the dialogue between the characters (and they all do a good job of holding on the Boston accent the entire film), and the superior acting carry the movie a long way. Not a yawner, not movie of the year, but fun to watch.",8
9 June 2020,"From the South of Boston, where do you go? Out west maybe?","This is still a favorite of ours for 20+ years now, our most recent viewing was last night on my DVD copy of the movie. We have probably watched it 5 or 6 times over the years.

This of course won the Oscar for Damon's and Affleck's script, which itself originated from a paper Damon wrote while in college. Quite an unlikely development for two 20-something friends but in watching the movie yet again I am struck with how well several meaningful themes are woven in the script.

The main theme is Damon's character, Will Hunting, who has a brilliant mind but as an orphan was abused in his foster home, resulting in his building a mostly impenetrable shell around himself. Some of the best scenes are with him and his psychologist Sean, played by Robin Williams.

And Ben Affleck, Damon's best friend in real life, is Will's best friend Chuckie who doesn't have a brilliant mind and accepts that he will be a laborer all his life. He would feel insulted if Will ended up wasting his gift.

All this comes to a head when Will meets Skyler who will soon be graduating from college and heading out west for medical school. She and Will fall in love but Will is scared to commit himself to a relationship. In the end he has to decide if he will just stay in Boston.",

14 May 2014,A Not So Beautiful Mind Surrounds An Impressive Innate Intellect,"Will Hunting's Mind has been Damaged with that Cringe Inducing Clich√© Known as an Orphan who Suffered Severe Physical and Mental Abuse from Foster Parents. This is at the Cracked Center of His Character with an Innate Intelligence that is Off the Scale. It is that Battered Baggage that He Carries that Suffocates a not so Innate Ability to See Himself for what He is. A Genius with a Gift that can Benefit Mankind.

A Professor Discovers Will's Genius and makes it His Duty and Assignment to Bring Him out of the Closet Attempting Psychoanalysis. It can be Frustrating Watching Matt Damon's Character Pooh-Pooh Advances of Concern with Belligerence and Condescension. But Robin Williams as the Last in a Long Line of Uppity Shrinks that Failed is more Earthy and Will Hunting Bonds with the Bearded One and the Demons Inhabiting His Psyche are there to be Exorcised.

The Movie is Charming and Co-Writer and Co-Star Ben Affleck is Here as a Childhood Chum. In this Film Affleck Shows Signs of being a Better Writer than Actor but that is a Discussion for a more Lengthy Exercise. He is Adequate but it is not much of a Stretch since He is Basically Playing Himself. The Professor Part is Intensely Played by Stellan Starsgard and Minnie Driver is the Love Interest.

Gus Van Zant's Direction is Surprisingly Unintrusive and He Delivers a Nice Calm Atmosphere to Surround the Volatile Story that has Many Confrontational Scenes, Physical, Intellectual, and Emotional. Overall, the Movie may be Overrated a bit and not Everything Works to Perfection (this is no Masterpiece), but it is a Highly Engaging, Energetic Exercise that Convinced Critics, the Academy, and the General Public that this was Indeed Something Special. It is.

Note...Casey Affleck is on board with another ""need subtitles"" embarrassment as not one line of his dialog is decipherable and this may be his most mumbling ""performance"" ever and almost ruins every scene. Definitely the low-light of the Movie.",9

3 May 2023,"Raw, feel good, and everything done with perfection.","This movie could easily drown in the grave yard of ""broken orphan boy finds his pathway""trope. But this felt so raw throughout the course, each scenes and dialogues are so well thought out. Robin Williams as a therapist was the exact bowl of endearing optimism that we need more in these feel good movies. It was encouraging enough and not over the top preachy. The hero's journey felt organic and the plots seem well paced and not stretched or rushed to engage with the viewers attention.

This is a fantastic masterpiece of how to make a simple movie within the classically loved tropes without it feeling monotonous. I'll rewatch if from time to time.

12 April 2010,Better than Good,"According to legendary film-writer William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Princess Bride), it was he who changed Affleck and Damon's treatment from something altogether more conventional into the Oscar-winning screenplay filmed by Gus Van Sant. Whoever is responsible, we should simply be glad the film was made, as it's a very well realised, emotionally satisfying, mostly original drama; from the moving performances, especially from Robin Williams and Minnie Driver, to Van Sant's camera, forever searching for the soul of the scene, this is clearly confident, intelligent film-making.

For all its truths, the film is fantastical: under Danny Elfman's twinkling, otherworldly score, there isn't a single shot of Will (Damon) actually reading one of the books he knows by heart. Indeed, we're never quite clear where Will finds the time to feed his dizzying intellect between working, fighting and drinking. Less forgivable is that Driver's Skylar is rather unfairly banished from the third act, reducing a bright character to a dull device to provide a neat ending.

For my money, in terms of Van Sant's 'crowd-pleasing' output, Good Will Hunting doesn't quite scale the heights of the more acerbic To Die For, or the more politically substantial Milk. But thought-provoking and very nicely played nonetheless.",7
11 March 2006,Genius doesn't know how to mop a floor,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",1
28 March 2020,good will hunting,"So, if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny of Every art book ever written. Michelangelo. You know a lot about him: life's work, political aspirations, him and the Pope, sexual orientation, the whole works, right? But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at the beautiful ceiling, seen that.

20 February 2023,Maths does lead to love,"There are some movies after we watch them we wish we had never watched them, and there are some other, we wish we forget watching them start all over again. This one certainly falls into the later category.

Math and romance go hand in hand through out the major part of the narration and the formula worked out really well. I quote, the formula and not the hypothesis.

To put it in a mathematical perspective, the roots of movie are perfect making it a perfect square of romance and drama. Perfect square of denail and uncertainty of the lead role. Perfect square of professor and psychiatrist classmates and link to the lead role. Perfect square of friends and love life of lead role. There's no negativity touch that lead to the imaginary root. With mathematics as soul and a face for romance and appropriate limbs made it a perfect character to make time to watch it atleast once if not many times.

8 January 2023,Good Will Comes Close,"Good Will Hunting has some solid elements going for it and at times it does hit its marks fairly well. Looking at the casting, Robin Williams gives an unusually restrained performance and turns in some of his best work. Stellan Skarsgard is solid as well. Matt Damon does the best he can here but I can't help but feel his is simply miscast and not truly believable in this role which could have been better served by another lesser known, grittier actor. As for the story, its fairly predictable and doesn't really give us many surprises. Despite a few issues Good Will Hunting does manage to be somewhat effective and is worth checking out.

25 March 1999,9.5,"I am torn between giving this movie a 9 or a 10. I will not go into how good this movie is, because it has already been said many times. But it is not quite a ""10"", because of a couple things. Firstly, Minnie Driver's character seemed really unnecessary. Why do they have to insert a romance into every movie? It really ruins the plausibility of the movie - all of the other characters don't suddenly find their ""true loves"", why does the main character always have to? It really didn't even have much of anything to do with the story.

Also, the idea that you have to go to Harvard or even college to get a good job is highly overrated. If this kid is such a genius, there are many jobs he could just walk into (and probably be happier doing). There is a middle ground between being a janitor and a 6 figure salary.

Otherwise it is definitely a must-see flick, almost a 10.",9
25 October 2009,typical mainstream film product,"The only reason this movie got made, I suppose, is that Robin Williams found a role he liked and wanted to do. A few notes : (1). The type of ""genius"" that is portrayed here does not, to my knowledge, exist. Mathematics and the humanities emanate from two different areas in the brain, both of which are NEVER simultaneously developed to the extent indicated here. On top of that Will Hunting has what is apparently a photographic memory. AND he's very good-looking, *AND* he's a tough. Wow. This is really yet another dumbed-down Superhero movie in disguise.

(2). Psychiatry is a highly complex and arcane field, as intellectually formidable as anyone could want. You can neither embrace it nor reject it wholesale. The pompous, self-deluded disdain shown by uneducated people for ""shrinks"" is here also shown by Will, thereby negating his supposed intellectual worthiness. Also, psychoanalytic theory ceased being at the forefront of psychotherapy decades ago. People who are still bashing Freud should really do a bit of reading.

This falls into the category of 99% of films that are designed for passive viewing, and not to challenge or stimulate the viewer in any real sense. It all adds up to a big nothing ; just a bunch of oversweetened moments that will work for people who have no real mental life. The ""math"" here is little more than a set-prop with no real depth or detail (Disclaimer : I am an engineer). Will Hunting and his coterie of ""friends"" are really total dumbasses. The ""girlfriend"" is skin-crawlingly obnoxious, but then again men are desperate fools, so I guess he COULD endure her.

The two kids who wrote this movie have never actually read a difficult book. Its a film made BY the uneducated, FOR the uneducated. If you liked this, you are a pseudo-intellectual.",4
11 May 1999,A thoroughly predictable plot.,"Within fifteen minutes, one knew how it going to end. Lacking any real narrative suspense, the film then could only be appreciated on a scene to scene basis. Furthermore, I couldn't bring myself to worry about someone with a 170 I.Q. I believe the film would have been much more interesting had it focussed on the Ben Affleck character

15 August 1999,Good Will Hunting is simply one of the best films I've ever seen!,"I won't reveal anything about the plot, it just wouldn't be fair. But I will say one thing: Unique screenplay and great actors always guarantee a memorable movie. And this film makes no exception to that. I've never seen Matt Damon in any other film before this, and I have to say I was simply blown away by Damon's superb acting and his and Ben Affleck's first-class screen writing skills. Robin Williams is the right choice as the unconventional psychiatrist, Will's friends all do a great job and Minnie Driver plays an excellent role too. Good Will Hunting is at the same time funny, fascinating and touching, and avoids turning into an embarrassing study of how human mind really works. Even clich√©s don't feel like clich√©s in this brilliant film. These kinds of movies really make your brain tick. Well.. Mine at least.

As a closure: GO RENT THIS MOVIE ASAP!

(You won't be disappointed or if you are, blame yourself for not understanding a masterpiece when you see one.)",1
25 August 2000,Van Sant is the real star,"I had a real problem with the sentimentality of this movie. It drips with string-tugging melodrama and amateurish characterizations. The only movies that can get away with such tortured pop psychology were all made by Alfred Hitchcock.

I liked Minnie Driver and Ben Affleck, accent or no (it's hard to tell), and Robin Williams was OK. Matt Damon's character is so depressingly obvious that it's difficult to sit through his journey to self-awareness, and the epiphany scene is just embarrassing.

But I can't say enough about Gus Van Sant and his deceptively transparent direction. Somehow he makes the flat script come alive with just a few touches. Notice how he uses the stationary and panning shots - and how he frames each image to make it vital. This is especially true for the scenes with Driver. I'm not a Van Sant fan, but I think he really lifted this movie up by its wet corners and tried his best to give it life.

21 August 2013,"Heartwarming, Inspired Script and Performances,","Good Will Hunting is a fantastic movie with a great plot and a very inspired cast. The script is very well written and developed by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, they should definitely write another movie together some day. The story of a young man struggling to realise his uniqueness is perfectly chronicled by them, it is deep, meaningful and very heartfelt.

The only thing I felt this film was lacking is more character development for people other than Will. I understand he is the main character, but I certainly would like to have learned more about Sean, Chuckie and Skylar, who all have terrific individual dialogue with Will, but that dialogue only seldom reveals more about their past.

All the performances in this are truly breathtaking, but the star of the show has to be Robin Williams. He is a very funny actor, but further showcases here that he had a huge gift for drama. He showed this in movies like Dead Poets Society and Good Morning Vietnam, proving without any doubt that he is just as good being serious as he is funny, going on to win an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. There was great chemistry between Damon and Williams in their scenes together, those parts are without a doubt the movies highlights.

The film never struggles to be meaningful, no dialogue or scene ever feels forced or thrown at its audience, the escalation is very smooth and subtle, other movies could take advice from that. Well written and superbly acted, I would recommend Good Will Hunting to anyone looking for a good drama.

A man with a special gift, who does not want to change anything about his life, is discovered by a professor. He gets help from a professional psychologist to find out what his problem is, meanwhile he also falls for a girl.

Best Performance: Robin Williams",9

10 November 2006,A Rose by any other name would still start with F,"Again, like ""Midnight Run"" this movie is dented with bad language. Yes, maybe people like these guys do use the F word every time they exhale, but then again, I think it's a stereotype. I mean, where's the lobby for foster-kids-on-their-own? I resent the stereotype that poor ""Southie"" kids are vile, that they can't speak without that word. It's far overdone.

I like the story. I do like the fun concept of an underdog gone good. I like someone who can out-brain the brains; but I agree that Matt Damon does not have the persona to pull it off. Ben Affleck would have been a better choice. I think Damon was chosen as the main star because he is less handsome and charismatic than Affleck. They wanted to get Damon in the door of public awareness first.

Oh well. It's a fun movie if you can tune out the words. Robin Williams has perfect timing in his interactions with Will. The baseball scene is wonderful.

All in all, a good film; too bad the language hurt it.",6

A well meaning professor tries to help by contacting an old school friend, Robin Williams. The relationship between Matt Damon's character and that of Robin Williams is a pleasure to watch unfold. Minnie Driver is excellent as a young college student who loves Will despite his many emotional problems. Very close to being rated a 10 in my opinion. I certainly recommend it highly.

22 June 2019,One of Those Rare Moments in Film History - A Modern Classic,"Will Hunting is a young genius born on the wrong side of the tracks. Living in the rough streets of Boston and constantly in trouble with the law, the future bodes none too bright as the only paths that lay ahead seem jail or menial labor if he's lucky. In a fortuitous twist of fate a distinguished and lauded professor who teaches in the same university he janitors for discovers his towering talent and desires to see him attain the heights he deserves. But the shackles of the past clamp too hard, and Will proves reluctant and difficult in the brisk change. Enter Sean Maguire, a professor/psychiatrist with a past who proves more than a match for the smart but obnoxious and headstrong Will and the eventual relationship that would test both men as they discover themselves and develop a deep bond that liberates them both. Perfect casting, flawless acting, a seamless script and excellent directing make this an instant classic and a prime example on the inimitable standard of American cinema. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (who also controversially co-wrote the screenplay) deservedly became stars with this and became media and public darlings leaving a lasting legacy that endures to this day. An unforgettable tale on identity, childhood, love, friendship and life, this masterpiece proves the value of art and how it can reach into and depict the heart of life itself and enrich us with its essence.",10
30 July 2020,Certainly a Masterpiece,"Not sure why I took so long to see this movie, but having seen performances from all the main actors in this film, I don't think any of them have done any better since this film.

While the movie is formulaic, the performances of Robin Williams, Matt Damon, and Minnie Driver allow you to overlook that. Williams very much deserved his Oscar and I can't think of anybody who could have played his role any better than him. Damon has always struck me as a smart and cocky type of person but for a few fleeting moments, shows real vulnerability. And with the way the movie ends, we don't have to judge Driver's performance based on how her character reacts.

But overall, a movie that is very much worth seeing if you haven't seen it before.

17 August 2014,Worth Rewatching,"Matt Damon's breakthrough work. A masterpiece that's made possible by a good, simple, honest script, a bunch of high quality new faces and vintage actors, and a drive to tell meaningful story of real people.

I watched this a second time recently, and picked up even more nuances that I missed years ago. Robin Williams played his 'therapist with unresolved past' part so perfectly. Great synergy between the young Damon and Williams.

The under-estimated Minnie Drivers also made a supporting appearance here. Good chemistry between the love birds. Unforced, un-self-conscious naturalistic acting from actresses is so rare, a pleasure to watch.

Evident in this movie, Ben Affleck is a genuinely modest human being who is really not conceited about his natural good looks or brain. I hope he take his return as writer-producer and actor-producer seriously. Hollywood can do with more progressive actor producers like him.",10
28 February 2003,One of 1997's Best Films!,"Matt Damon proves himself as one of the best actors in Hollywood. What's more, he co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck. This film is probably the best that one will ever see Affleck in-he's highly over-rated. Nonetheless, a strong story, good acting, and excellent direction from Gus Van Sant make `Good Will Hunting' one of the best films of 1997. I have to give credit to Robin Williams for his powerful performance as Will's mentor, Sean. Danny Elfman provides a poignant score, as well. ***1/2

We all need a little guidance in our lives, and we might not know as much as we think we do about the lives of others. This is just one of the many lessons this movie shares.

26 March 2013,Living Genius Society,"A case where Hollywood lucks out and 2 young writers/actors come along and create a masterful script that tricks Robin Williams to do a sequel to Dead Poets Society. Not literally, but the story's formula and function of Robin's DPS character remain the same. Calculus replaces poetry with a hint of matrices to come.

Outside of setting and soundtrack mistakes of Gus Van Sant's mid-life crisis and 1970s revelry that makes this film seem a decade older than his classic My Own Private Idaho (1991), the first half is genius. Then, he and Robin Williams turn it into more of a seize the girl, love-will-save-you clich√© than an outside-the-matrix, seize your genius modern-day intellectual fantasy.

Despite the probably unintentional attempts to subvert it and the annoying product placement that had taken over Hollywood, the story is an adult male intellectual/geek fantasy. Even the gals are telling dirty jokes about alternative uses for their mouths.",6
2 May 1999,"Ordinary People, anyone?","This movie is overrated, predictable and manipulative. There is some quirkiness in the dialogue and Matt Damon does a great job (giving credit to where credit is due), but I can't believe how some audiences and critics view this movie as ""revolutionary."" First off, the relationship between Damon and Robin Williams echoes, right up to the ""it's not your fault"" climax, Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch in Ordinary People. The people in Will Hunting's life who attempt to get through to him--Ben Affleck, Williams, Minnie Driver, etc--was also liberally borrowed from Robert Redford's classic. As for Williams, the fact he won an Oscar for what is basically a replay of his ""Dead Poet's Society"" role is baffling to me. I'd like to think that Oscar rewarded him for his overlooked dramatic performances in World According to Garp, Moscow on the Hudson, Awakenings and The Fisher King--his performances in all of those films blew his ""GWH"" Oscar-winning performance away. Much of this movie is paint-by-numbers (especially the climax). There were some deeper aspects to Will's life that Damon conveyed with his fine acting, yet they were never explored. Bottom line: If the movie had not been described as being ""brilliant"" and ""groundbreaking,"" my expectations would have been lower. Put this with ""Rain Man""and ""Terms of Endearment"" as one of the most overrated films of the last 20 years. Give me overlooked, unpredictable character dramas like ""Dominick and Eugene"" and ""Birdy"" over this one.",4
1 August 2018,Classic,"A brilliant film. Great performances and compelling characters coupled with moments of individual brilliance this movie is packed with quotable lines and is a lively watch in a truly believable world, 20 years on still holds up too much like Shawshank only gets better with age

23 May 2006,Loved it!,"GOOD WILL HUNTING ****1/2 The Weinstein and crew's bit of cinematic excellence boasts heartfelt drama, fresh humor, and interesting controversial issues from within. Working at the MIT as a janitor, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) becomes renown for his outstanding genius in mathematics. As the professors at the prestigious school in which he works try to force him to pursue his finesse, his personal problems hold him back. A troubled psychologist (Robin Williams) is the only man who can have him open his hurts so he can move forward in life. At least three major story lines occupy this picture, and Gus Van Sant keeps a firm handle on each.

17 April 2020,It's an incredibly beautiful film.,"The story line and the dynamic between Will and all his relationships are intriguing and emotional. It's a narrative on friendship, purpose, hardships, and moving on. The script is wonderful. The dialogue is realistic, witty, funny, and heartbreaking. There is so much emotion and depth to everyone's character. Matt Damon and Robin Williams both give the best performances of their lives. They both are so believable and you can sympathize with them so easily. The rest of the cast is great too, especially Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver.

Still, however, it is a wonderful film and I recommend it to all my friends and family. The actors were great, but I really liked Robin William's performance as the counselor. Williams always seems to be a great actor. Aside from Williams, Matt Damon was a great performer as the college custodian.

Don't take it from me, see this film for yourself.

4 October 2009,Perfect movie,"Watching HUNTING again 13 years later, I still find it a terrific effort, especially since it was written by the then-very young Damon and Affleck. A janitor (Damon) at MIT is a math whiz with serious emotional problems. A once-prominent shrink (Williams) with problems of his own is brought in to deal with the kid. Meanwhile, romance is blossoming between the janitor and a high-spirited Harvard pre-med student (Driver). The janitor's pals, a bunch of blue collar types led by Affleck, are uneasy with what's happening but always stand by this shy Einsteinian genius. Not a single false note is struck in this intense adult drama, which was well deserving its R rating for salty language and refusing to pull any punches. It was easy to see Damon would be going places, although I am not sure I could have predicted he would become become a 21st century action star. And of course his writing partner and buddy Affleck went on to greater glory in PHANTOMS.

20 November 2014,One of the Best and Most Therapeutic Movies Ever Made.,"1997 was a very difficult year for movies. There was Titanic (that took almost every award), Good Will Hunting, LA Confidential, Boogie Nights, Air Force One, Cop Land, Austin Powers and loads of others. Good Will Hunting was one of the movies that year that continues to mesmerize and inspire everybody that sees it. Sad thing is, the movie was nominated for many awards, but won every little against Titanic. Titanic won almost every award because it had more things to offer. Titanic had the song, score, sets, acting, originality, suspense, among others that were either at par with, or better than other movies of that year. Good Will Hunting was not a great piece of ""film."" There was no (or very little) elements of camera tricks, deep focus, symbolism etc. All it had was a great story and a great script, those were all it needed. Good Will Hunting had the best script of the year and one of the best scripts ever. If a movie has witty dialogue, as this does, it deserves a pat on the back. If a movie contains dialogue that sears the heart and drives your emotions, it deserves a major award.

Will Hunting (Damon) is a janitor at MIT that solves extremely complicated equations in an instant that most professors take years to prove. After Will gets in trouble with law for the umpteenth time, one of the professors interested in him (Skarsgaard) sets him up with a psychology professor at a community college (Williams) to council him. As a child, Will was abused and abandoned by his parents, so he pushes away anything that gets close to him because he is afraid of being hurt again. Will is lost and scared and it is up to Sean Maguire, who understands him completely to make Will realize how precious his gift is. Both Will and Sean's lives will be changed forever.

Good Will Hunting is a movie about searching the human soul for who you are. The therapy scenes, actually almost the whole movie is enough to completely take a toll on the viewer and inspire them and give hope. The acting is top notch by all, especially by Damon and Williams. I think this is Williams' best movie, not because he won the Oscar for it, but because it was one of the few serious roles he did the can change people's lives. We have Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams and the rest of the cast to thank for this life-changing movie.",10
2 November 2012,A touching venture,"A youthful, but unhinged genius Will Hunting (Matt Damon) works as a janitor at the MIT, where he conspicuously solves higher level mathematical conundrum handed out to students by Fields Medal-winning combinatorialist Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd). Shocked by the ingenuity of the troubled orphan Lambeau ventures to have him enrol as his student. The South Boston bred man-child however prefers to spend time and money on booze by the gallons with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Billy McBride (Cole Hauser) and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck). Following a aggressive assault by Hunting on a man who bullied him as a child, Will agrees to attend therapeutic sessions and become Lambeau's prot√©g√©. After several therapist resign from taking on the troublesome genius, Lambeau finally asks his former roommate Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to take on the formidable task. Despite a soul-breaking first encounter, Maguire decides on the challenge, despite the necessity of overcoming Hunting's intellectually layered self-defence mechanisms...

Back in the days ""Good Will Hunting"" offered a novelty perspective, one heavily layered in witty dialogue, well versed psychoanalysis and somehow avoiding pointless on-screen blabbering. A brain-child of youthful Affeck and Damon came a brilliant piece of drama, strongly carried on the shoulders of the central theme of the therapeutic sessions. Probably Gus van Sant's most mainstream effort is arguably also his most honest and best. Unskewed by pretence the story sells as a traditionally structured drama, but with such an intensely successful script, which makes it an undying classic. Although several scenes do seem rough, especially those centred around Skarsg√•rd and the wasting away of Will's talent, almost misguided in intent and somewhat hollow, nowhere close to as forceful as the key sessions between Maguire and Hunting. Exposition is pretty low key and apart from lone scenes like Hunting's love interest, Skylar (Minnie Driver) flying away to California shuns away from artistic endeavours, keeping a simple and focused outlook on the key issues at hand - the question of fulfilment as defined by intellectual achievements as opposed to that of bliss happiness caused by human interaction.",8

16 July 2013,Very Deep & Exhilaratingly Fresh! ‚ô¶ 96%,"I am blown away right now. Not by the fledgling writers, but Matt Damon. I have watched his action movies and most recently his Behind The Candelabra (2013), but Good Will HUnting will stay one of his best movie for me.

Telling a wonderful tale in 120 minutes isn't a child's play and I am glad Damn & Ben Affleck came up with it. Robin Williams has been charming and his humor is engagingly funny. I still think of some of his rhetoric jokes. While the supporting cast is splendid, I am amazed by the music & score.

Fine screenplay & cinematography, the best thing about Good Will Hunting is the plot & the story of lives of people, especially when the relation is showcased intricately. A 9.6/10 for this beautiful drama. Because it is not a melodrama.

BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended!

13 November 2014,A superbly written and acted film,"GOOD WILL HUNTING, even though there really aren't any narrative surprises, is filled with wonderful dialogue and bolstered by strong performances. The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who is a bit of a hard case when it comes to his personal life, but is also a mathematical genius. Together with the help of an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a psychologist (Robin Williams) he comes to understand his true potential. The best parts of the film are the many dialogue scenes, some emotionally deep and others biting, that add so much depth to the characters. This was a passion project for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and it shows. The dialogue felt natural and true to life, which adds to the authenticity of the overall experience. Though everyone (including Ben Affleck) turns in an excellent performance, Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good. Matt Damon is the hard-headed young adult who is afraid to let people in, and Robin Williams is a professor with experience and insight that he uses to get to Will. Even though the narrative structure wasn't the tightest, there was something to enjoy about every scene, and all of them added something to the overall picture. I should also mention that Minnie Driver does a great job as Will's girlfriend, and Casey Affleck has a few of the best lines. As far as other aspects go I enjoyed the score, which was never intrusive or told the audience how to feel. There was also a rather eclectic soundtrack which fit the moods of various scenes perfectly. Overall, it was a superbly written film with equally good performances.",9
7 March 2009,More than just 'good',"""Good Will Hunting"", written by co-stars Matt Damon & Ben Affleck, tells the story of a troubled young genius (Matt Damon) who avoids jail time by agreeing to work with an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) who sees unbounded potential in him. However, he must also meet regularly with a psychiatrist (Robin Williams) which is a situation that he greets with much resistance.

The cast is well-assembled with Matt Damon delivering a fine performance which snagged him his only Oscar nomination to date. Minnie Driver, as Will's love interest, also landed an Oscar nomination. Robin Williams won his first Oscar for his role here after three previous nominations. The rest of the cast is solid, particularly the under-appreciated Stellan Skarsg√•rd.

Gus Van Sant's direction is well-handled, which is illustrated by the Oscar nomination that he received. Danny Elfman's Oscar-nominated score is also good, though it doesn't rely on his usual idiosyncrasies. Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack which includes some notable selections, including a handful of Elliott Smith songs, like the Oscar nominee ""Miss Misery"".

Overall, ""Good Will Hunting"", despite the incredibly precious title, is a worthwhile film. Fine performances and a compelling (Oscar-winning) script combine to produce a memorable film that should be fondly remembered for years to come.",8

17 March 2008,One of the worst,"Um... Maybe I just didn't get it... but everyone thinks i am a freak with no soul because i hated this movie...I will tell you why i hated it...

First off, i began to literally fall asleep in the middle of the movie because this movie was very very boring. The story absolutely sucked. I don't see how these guys won a best screenplay for this. The dialogue was painfully forced and unrealistic--am I supposed to laugh at the ""how do you like them apples line"".. am i supposed to feel a sense of accomplishment for the character? Instead with that line, and in fact that whole scene and the rest of the movie had me saying ""WTF?????""

Not to mention that scene in the bar again, but who has conversations at a bar like that? Not even Harvard attendees talk like that at a bar--they are busy doing keg stands and playing beer pong.

Where were the basic elements of a good story in this? Rising action--climax--falling action--character development--protagonist--antagonist. Is anyone with me on this...

Or am I alone in the world?",1
29 July 1998,Manipulative but well done.,"How many handsome mathematical geniuses working as janitors and whose ambition in life is to get drunk and get into as many fistfights as possible have you ever met in your life?

The main problem with Good Will Hunting is that the main character is as believable as Godzilla or Forrest Gump: it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to swallow Will Hunting's behaviour and motivations. At least Forrest Gump was a nice guy: Will Hunting's attitude, which is supposed to be the product of an abusive upbringing and therefore ""not his fault"", gets on your nerves after a while. Sure, it's satisfying seeing poor Will defy the establishment figures (judges, psychiatrists and snob rich college students) and getting away with it. For a while. Too bad this get boring after a while, with the viewer always ahead of the story until the predictable finale. But as long as you don't think too long about the implausibilities of the movie's setup, the story is convincingly acted and reasonably well-told, though director Gus Van Sant doesn't show any of the offbeat touches that marked his earlier efforts (the closer he gets here is a weird slow-motion courtyard fight).

Robin Williams is fine as always, and more restrained than usual; the rest of the cast is adequate, though I would have loved to see more of Stellan Skaarsgard's math professor, easily the most interesting character.",7
23 February 2010,Emotional and humorous real life picture,"A university professor seeks to help a mathematical genius who has had problems with the law and on his release, Will Hunting (Damon) must agree to see a psychologist.

Opening with a colourful slow moving montage of a long haired Matt Damon scribbling maths equations on his mirror, we are instantly engaged into a strong psychological drama that will make you laugh, cry and be enticed into a world of intelligence.

This splendid picture, almost 13 years old now, has lost none of its relevance in real world story telling. Written by Damon and Ben Affleck, the two dive deep into the world of a man with personal problems whilst being mathematically gifted, much to his disappointment. The two friends picked up an Oscar for their best original screenplay and over the course of 1997 it seems this was the most refreshing and hit the drama harder than most. Had it not been for a bravado OCD suffering portrayal by Jack Nicholson then Damon would surely have been a certain for the best actor.

Robin Williams managed to scoop best actor in a supporting role and his power of intelligence to read people in his role is staggering. His ability to conform to the form and thoughts of a psychologist is a brilliant execution of using his job and his own personal experience to associate with the troublesome Will. Certain improvisations such as the little secrets about his wife and the story about the baseball game are all little revelations, all sweet real life stories that we as viewers are able to associate with and because of these inclusions we can sit and enjoy the high power of the drama but chill and laugh along in some of the light hearted sequences.

This film's ability to conform to the comedy and drama genre is excellent whilst throwing in the odd romance ideology and scientific lexis. Minnie Driver adds a subtle intelligence to the film with her protagonist's enthusiasm but also youthful vulnerability in the face of her feelings. And again these performances by all members are so real and identifiable you feel enticed right into their personal stories and believe me this is no exaggeration. Whilst the film revolves around complex concepts such as mathematical equations, the power of labour and conditional love this can be viewed by any person and be appreciated on any level as there are great comedy sequences, the ""How do you like them apples?!"" to the dramatic ""Its not your fault"".

Gus Van Sant is able to further establish his authority through basic real worldly settings, such as the sequence on the bench by the pond and the rough neighbourhood which is very good at establishing character development.

My words will do this film an injustice because it is so breathtakingly forward in its approach to real world issues such as youthful violence and naivety and taking life for granted but should you watch it, you will not have your time wasted.",9
15 April 2000,Feels like it was written by two guys in their mid-twenties. Oh wait...,"Good Will Hunting is a very frustrating movie. It feels like it should be good, and I very much wanted it to be good, but it never quite reached that point. A movie with so much going for it--a good cast, a great setting, and an interest basic story--shouldn't be as simple-mindedly written as Good Will Hunting is. Hardly Oscar-worthy, the script plays more like a final assignment from a first year screenwriting class. Almost completely lacking in invention and subtlety, the script seems aimed toward the lowest common denominator of the age group that wrote it--in this case, early to mid-twenties. While the movie is not completely devoid of meaning or entertainment, there is so little of either one present here that the movie is only worth watching if you don't know there are a number of better and more mature ways the story could have been told.

18 January 2012,How did this film manage to get on the top 250?,"While the acting is good, the story is hardly likely and contains inconsistencies. Will's mathematical ""proofs"" are really ""solutions"" to problems. The writers clearly know nothing of their subject matter, and have failed to consult sufficiently in an area outside their expertise. Furthermore, the ""psychological"" side of the story is simple and really contains nothing new or interesting (basically, it's the story of a normal guy who's had some issues in his life, who reads avidly and has a great interest in math, yet somehow does not even know the names of the theorems he makes use of in his ""proofs""). Wishful thinking from people with little to no background in science, and ignorant enough to believe that Will's level of knowledge is possible without study. I put this movie on the same level as ""The Girl Next Door"": an adolescent movie whose entertainment value is due primarily to the distraction in provides.

7 September 2021,One of my Favourites,"HUGE film fanatic here! There's something about 80s-90s movies that hit so differently, IF done properly. Good Will Hunting is an excellent example of this. I absolutely adore this movie. I think the concept is brilliant, I think the actors chosen are perfect, I think the busy, city life setting is the right move. There's just so much that works here for me. I think the final 10 minutes of the movie is arguably the most powerful because it leaves the the viewer saying to themselves ""wow, this is it, this is the end of a young mans routine in which he's done everyday for his entire life, what's next""? That final question you ask yourself is so powerful because the director allows the viewer to becomes so ""obsessed"" and comfortable with Will's everyday routine, and now he's moving on to bigger and better things. Understanding this is so satisfactory because this is after all of his blood, sweat and tears. It's nice to see a genuine movie with true intentions end in such a pure way. I'm fan boying a little bit over this. Well done cast and crew.

20 November 2000,A pretentious load of twaddle,"This movie is very very silly. The worn-out concept of the enfant terrible is mixed with the even more worn-out concept of boy-genius in this pretentious flick by a group of people who ought to know better.

27 January 2017,Good Will Hunting Revisited,"I recently had the opportunity to see Good Will Hunting for the second time. I had not seen it since its video release in 1997. It's funny how nearly twenty years can change your opinion about a movie. I was lukewarm to the film back then, but now - older and wiser - I see it in a new light.

I had initially dismissed this film as a two hour study of a bunch of unlikeable and unbelievable people. But now it is evident that Matt Damon deserved his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the title character, the good Will Hunting.

Damon does a yeoman's job making us believe in someone who is not only a math genius with a photographic memory, but a barroom- brawler, cynic, janitor, lover, and all-around down-to-earth working-class joe. Damon and his compadre Ben Affleck also deserved their Oscar screenplay win for creating a character more fantastic than any from the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Robin Williams also deserved his Oscar win for having us buy his interpretation of an all-knowing beard-sporting eye-glinting joke- cracking-but-no-nonsense psychologist.

Affleck, director Gus Van Sant, and the rest of the cast merit mention as well for trying to get us to like and accept all the unappealing and implausible characters who populate this fantasy world.

All this leads me to believe that I should revisit films like Showgirls, The River Wild, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, and The Greek Tycoon. Maybe I was a little too harsh in my initial assessment of those as well.

Yeah, right.",3
20 June 2019,Honorable performance,"The fatherly figure performance that Robin Williams encapsulates is breathtaking; with a trusting warmth and glow to his character. The working class lifestyle Will lives by is conflicted by his vast knowledge and abilities which he must address to progress with his life. Will being someone of weak character suffers from opening up to new people in his life and would rather confide to the loyalty he has already established with his life long friend - Will is portrayed a relatable character, one who fears revealing his true emotions. The long and awkward camera zooms is what sells the true tormented emotions the characters are feeling, it allows Damon to show the true extent of his acting abilities and completely smashes it.

1 February 2005,Robin Williams stole the show,"My brother bought Good Will Hunting on Sunday night at Best Buy and I finally saw it last night on the big screen. All I can tell you of this fine movie was that the script was made excellently by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. They wrote the movie in a great and neat way that is extremely original. The performances and acting was terrific. Matt Damon performed his temper tantrum, genius character in a very pleasant performance that I enjoyed watching. But the best of them all, had to be academy award winner, Robin Williams. He put up the best performance I have ever seen, even over his Mrs. Doubtfire character. He definitely stole the show as an emotional and smart psychiatrist. Good job, Williams. There was a lot of funny scenes also and the movie kind of reminded me of A Beautiful Mind. There both almost very similar in ways. The negatives that I have to give for the film was that it was pretty slow at times and needed to boost up. On some of the scenes they needed more energy on it. Just got kind of boring and some of the scenes held some flaws. Overall, a pleasing Damon and Williams film that I would like to watch again soon. Great Script and Acting by lead Performances!! I recommend the film.

Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+",9
24 November 2012,My Seek Solace Film,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10
20 December 2005,"""Twenty years of counseling, I've seen some pretty awful sh*t. "" - Sean","Everyone raved about 'Good Will Hunting' when it came out. At the time all I could do was roll my eyes and say, ""Cmon. A movie written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yuck!"". I finally got around to seeing it about a week ago, and I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised. 'Good Will Hunting' isn't a great Oscar-worthy movie most critics pointed it out to be, but just a very good film with some good acting performances. Matt Damon in his finest acting performance yet plays Will. Will is considered a hoodlum by some and hangs out with his buddies led by Chuckie (Ben Affleck in a so-so performance, which is very good for him). They screw around, get drunk and beat people up -- they are real 'nothings' to society. But, Will has a secret -- he's a genius. He works as a janitor at Harvard University and one day solves a ""said-to-be"" impossible math problem put up by the brilliant Math professor (played by Stellan Skarsgaard in a strong performance). Will then becomes the math professor's new hero and is destined for greatness, but will Will abandon his friends to better his own life? Robin Williams steals the show in an electrifying performance as Will's psychiatrist and Minnie Driver provides good acting as Will's British Harvard girlfriend. Gus Van Sant's directing is fair and the writing is pretty solid for the most part (but nothing Academy Award worthy). The bottom line is that 'Good Will Hunting' is a very good film where the good points more then out-weigh the bad points, but it's nothing spectacular. I recommend it. Grade: B",7
3 July 2011,Utter tosh,"I'm amazed that this spume ever got close to winning an Oscar. It only goes to show that no matter how great the accolades or how high the rating you can still end up watching the most appalling drivel, dressed up as some kind of worthwhile exercise in entertainment. Bulls balls, last night I watched ""in Bruges"" and it was very good, a million miles away from this Oscar winning (substitute prohibited word).

OK so now I must get down to a serious criticism of the movie, based on twenty five minutes and twenty seven seconds, after which I couldn't stomach it any more. Where do I start? Hollywood in its purest form is a place (a fantasy) where we are taken and everything is wonderful. But this kind of Hollywood is just a pretend world which is not real and not uplifting either, it neither corresponds to an ideal or a real, it is just pap. It is a depressed fantasy of a reality that never existed. The idea that you have a genius cleaning a college corridor and filling out maths equations on a blackboard, and then having a verbal fist fight with a student at a bar by quoting lots of long words and phrases at him, which will really impress the girl at the bar with the English accent is just so lame, why would anybody think that that was cleaver. Is this film just patronising uneducated but intelligent people or what, I don't know. I give up.",1
19 June 2023,this is the movie that is imperative to watch at least once in your lifetime,"I'm of the opinion that this is the movie that is imperative to watch at least once in your lifetime, as it teaches some incredibly influential lessons that are fabulously presented by actors like Robin Williams, rest his soul, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. This movie is in the genre that are the most important for one to watch, because they are movies about people. Relationships, insecurities, childhood trauma, but most of all - development.

Good Will Hunting shows the development of a character in no other way I've seen in movies before, with Will starting out as a typical troublemaker always looking to push your buttons and sniff out what makes you tick, and the reason for this becomes apparent as you watch the movie. But by the end, he's a transformed man, a mirrored version of the Will we are introduced to at the start of the movie.

This film is also unique in the way it teaches its lessons - through Will's therapy sessions throughout the movie. Normally you'd have a conflict that is resolved by the end of the movie to preach its message to the viewers, but instead this movie intends to tell you what it wants to through Will's therapist, almost like what he has to say isn't just for Will, but for you too.",10

4 December 1999,"Good film, but no classic","I have to admit that I enjoyed this film when it came out, much more than the heralded Titanic. Its formulaic elements (the story is a meeting between Ordinary People and Little Man Tate) were appealing.

Does it have it's flaws. Yes. It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature. But the rest of the film is amazing.

Matt Damon sparks life into his already great role. In a year where young actors did their best to impress, Matt Damon rode out on top (along with Edward Norton). His performance is full of charm. Robin Williams won a long-deserved oscar for a great performance, though it doesn't top his best (Mrs. Doubtfire). The directing by Gus Van Sant is good, but doesn't top his best either (Drugstore Cowboy).

All in all, a very good film, one that I will see again, but it isn't a classic.

6 August 2001,genuine geniuses don't mop floors,"By definition, most of us are fairly ordinary, but we seem to expect that people with marked ability should make the most of it. To use the biblical phrase, hiding one's talent under a bushell ( a brand of tea here in Australia) is a sin. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, better known as actors, put together the screenplay here which has to be regarded as a promising first attempt (they did get an Academy Award for it), but which is still rather uneven. There is some good dialogue and some very trite stuff, the characters do not surprise or even develop much and the story is reliant on coincidence.

Will Hunting (Matt Damon), from working class South Boston, is a 20 year old janitor at MIT, who happens to have mathematical ability exceeding that of the professors, not to mention a photographic memory and a firm grasp of Western history and philosophy. Something of a coincidence? Strangely, he remains undiscovered until he is spotted by a professor solving on a blackboard a difficult problem set for students. Will has an attitude and a liking for thumping people (acquired it seems in his disturbed childhood) and is about to go to jail, but the prof intervenes and Will is let out on a bond provided he learns some maths and sees a counsellor. After a couple of false starts (to emphasise just what a difficult little b'stard Will is), Robin Williams hoves into view as the counsellor, Maguire. The rest of the story concerns Dr Maguire's attempts to help Will sort out his problems, which become more complicated when he become involved with English medical student Minnie Driver (called Skylab or something).

Both Matt Damon (nearly B A Harvard) and Ben Affleck (his childhood friend in Cambridge, Mass.) have middle class backgrounds and it was no doubt a bit of a challenge for them to write a script about someone like Will. It would have been very interesting if someone really from a poor Boston background like Mark Wahlberg had done it. Will is sensitively realised and we see that it is difficult for someone with his fractured upbringing to have much self-worth. Yet no-one with a brain like his lacks an ego and I couldn't help thinking he wouldn't need Robin Williams to discover it for him.

I thought the most intriguing character in the film was Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), the MIT maths professor who discovers Will. Even though Lambeau has won the maths equivalent of the Nobel Prize, Will can still out-prove him, if that's the word. He is jealous, but he also is determined that Will succeed. He needs to believe Will is like him in that he must be pushed to succeed. Then Lambeau can tell himself if he had been pushed even harder he might have reached Will's level. At least then he will get some of the credit.

I had Gus Van Sant down as a rather odd-ball director with a gay sensibility (`My Own Private Idaho', `Even Cowgirls Get the Blues') though he got a bit more mainsteam in `The Rainmaker' (also with Matt Damon). This is a very nice ordinary quiet mainstream picture with a few good moments. Van Sant has since revisited the topic of nurturing genius (literary this time) in `Forrester'. This earlier effort is more effective because the Will character is a kind of Mozart of math, with God-given ability, and it's hard not to root for him, whereas the protagonist in `Forrester' is a cultural product, albeit black and from the slums. With his beefy glower, Matt Damon looks right and projects Will's hostility well while Robin Williams turns down the volume and puts in a restrained, almost elegant performance. You could rent worse for a quiet, cerebral, Friday night.",
17 July 1999,I agree...,"I agree with the last reviewer; the F word was used in about every other sentence. I ended up muting 3/4 of the movie so I wouldn't have to hear all that foul language. Which is too bad because this movie had real promise, then fell flat. I was disappointed when I saw the movie; it was nowhere near as good as I'd hoped. Robin Williams, though, was phenomenal and stole the movie away from Damon and Affleck. I was happy that he won the Supporting Actor Oscar. He was the only bright spot of this overrated movie.

26 March 2015,A very good movie with a very good cast,"Rating-8/10

Good Will Hunting is a movie that gets so many people talking, it is loved by many and the performances too. I felt as I watched just why do so many love it, I didn't think it was perfection but there is no doubt this is an interesting piece of cinema with it's smart plot and emotionally charged characters. I did feel it was very good and although only just about, it still manages to really let you enjoy it.

The first thing to say about this is Robin Williams who is at his very best here. He just feels so excellent as his role as Sean Maguire who as you will see councils Will Hunting and he adds an extra element to this movie Robin does. All the cast are fairly strong here, Matt Damon as Will is good and really shows us what he has got for his future film career. Cast such as Ben Affleck aren't really shown as much as the two I mentioned but him among his brother Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard form a good little cast for this type of film.

Ben Affleck and Matt Damon of course write the movie and they do a great job, not only capturing everyday life situations well, but adding in Will Hunting to those scenes to make it feel smart and funny. I did however feel it was slightly contrived, mostly in the way they want to get a certain emotion out of you, sometimes you can laugh and sometimes you can be sad, even times when they want you to think ""Oh wow he's smart that Will Hunting"". I will also add that the script though is really showcasing the talent these two guys have, and I do feel like these guys really are an example to look up to when aspiring screenwriters come up.

Gus Van Sant directs it well and his job is made easier by the fine script brought to him. He manages to delicately direct it without making the film feel done before or too much like a typical piece of cinema. Van Sant also could be said to contribute to Williams performance and you can see Gus really worked well with the cast to make them bring the most out of the script. Another delicate thing is the score, now when you making a film about a genius from Boston, Danny Elfman doesn't always spring to mind but he manages to beautifully score it and the music is really one thing I remember the most about watching the movie.

One good thing about the movie is that it is smart, not only in movie terms but in terms of the script and the actors who all seem to remember there lines so well, it almost feels like they all know mathematics like we see in the film. I think all the credit goes to Affleck and Damon who if I'm not mistaken, are not mathematic geniuses but do the screenplay in such a way that it feels like a professor has written parts of the film.

Overall it is the ending that is the real pay off, of course I'm not going to ruin it for you but lets just say it makes you feel emotion and really draws you close to the characters we see so much of in this movie. Overall this is totally worth a watch, not only for people thinking ""It's Oscar nominated, it must be good"", but also people who just want an interesting film, not for those who want action or true thrills but it is definitely one for the thinkers and maybe even the unidentified genius.",8
29 June 1999,A touching and great drama written and played by two young and talented young stars!!,"Will Hunting is a rebellious and resentful adolescent, who likes to always be in his friends' company, drinking beer, beating Harvard's boys and knowing girls. What makes Hunting different from the other youths of his age, besides the money and his behavior's problems,is that the boy is owner of a brilliant intelligence, what makes him capable to solve difficult and challenging mathematical problems, to decorate parts of books and many other things.He reads Marx, Pope, Kant and many other famous authors. Will doesn't know how to guide his capability in a productive way, but after a mathematics teacher discovers the boy's potential, he decides to take him to Sean McGuire( Robin Willians, who wrongly robbed Burt Reynolds' statue in the Oscar night), a hard, intelligent but sensitive psychologist, who has just lost his wife. The two end up building a true friendship, based on trust, and Will will have to evaluate his life and choose among continuing to go on with his simple life or to open himself for the brilliant future that waits for him... Matt Damon, a young actor, wrote this excellent drama's plot,together with his friend Ben Affleck. In the hands of director Gus Van Sant, ""Good Will Hunting"" stayed faithful to the original ideas of the young stars, and it consecrated them as two great promises,due to their latent talent and charisma. Robin Willians gives a contained and thrilling interpretation ,building with effectiveness a psychologist full of sorrow who, slowly, rediscovers the pleasure that life offers for those who want to get it. Actress Minnie Driver is excellent, portraying the girl who falls in love with Will and tries to make the boy surrender to the love! Gus Van Sant tried to avoid the exaggerations that marked his previous films, and he conducted with professionalism and talent a great film that teaches us something:for more difficult than life sometimes is is, if we count with values such as friendship, love, trust and pardon, is still possible to ennoble the world. Reaching the adolescent and adult public, ""Good Will Hunting"" is a thankful surprise!!watch the film, you will like it!!",8
16 October 2004,Discovery of neglected young genius proves true piece of work!,"The story here is simple: A neglected 20 something ghetto kid anonymously solves the ""unsolvable"" calculus problem at the university campus where he works as a janitor, then is hounded by intellectual scholars who want to furhter this untapped genius mind. One problem: The kid is a little eccentric, bordering on the severely disturbed, and only one ""shrink"" is getting thru to him. Add a little love story and a happy ending an you've got ""Good Will Hunting"". Half-way-through you get a delicious scene, where the hero cuts down a ""bully"" in the student cafeteria by going brain-explosion-verbally-ballistic on him! Not even Julia Sugarbaker could touch that one! Otherwise I was not nearly as impressed as cinema audiences and the Oscars Academy were. Once is enough for this one!

24 May 2005,um mm ewe,"This movie was so boring. My friend and I had a marker fight in the back of the theater, we were so bored. Usually, I love anything Robin Williams is in. While I liked his performance, the rest of the actors and the movie, by definition blew. The plot was slow, the character development was slow. Everything was slow and boring. I am so glad I didn't pay for it, because I would have demanded my money back. I cant remember the last time I ever wasted two hours. I only went because I had a free pass. I am infinitely glad that Damon and Affleck haven't written anything so rampantly horrible since. One good thing about it was, that it cant get much worse than that, and their future attempts can only get better, cant they?

24 June 2020,A masterpiece that personally means so much to me,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10
27 December 1998,10 of 10!,"Even if you took away all the pre Oscar/post Oscar hype, the delightful appeal of the cast (most notably the brother-like chemistry between Ben Afflick and Matt Damon.) You are still left with one heck of a great movie. The plot of the movie is good but the real charm of the movie is the power of the scripts writing. In fact there is no scene in the movie that isn't great. Most notably the scenes in which Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is being interviewed by the many shrinks which are supposed to help him. Definitely a must see!

1 September 2003,The Importance of Not Being Too Earnest,"This is just a movie, folks, not a case study. As interested as I am in literary, historical, and sociological elements of dramatic films, I am put off by psychoanalysis or tortured deconstruction.

What I liked about this one was Robin Williams' underplaying his role and Matt Damon's totally cold and rigid self-characterization -- apart from the conclusion, that is. There is a good sense of Boston as well.

The premise of the story is questionable as to any sense of consistent authenticity. Antisocial behavior need not be a concomitant of genius, as other recent films about gifted but more or less detached characters seem to take for granted (as does this one). Neither are saccharine catharses inevitable. And the usually fine actor Stellan Skarsgard as the American professor with a French name and a Swedish accent seems miscast. Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck with a passion, not unusual in a sense but hardly commendable in terms of his overblown popular persona. One wonders indeed how he figures in real life as putative co-author of this fairly decent screenplay.

In short, there are some good moments and good lines -- and that is really what counts, even when the finished whole is less interesting or convincing than the finite parts. Worth seeing. 7 of 10.",7
29 September 2023,Good Will Hunting is good enough,"(1997) Good Will Hunting DRAMA

Written and starring Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck playing Will's best friend, Chuckie. Tries to avoid itself to be self- indulgent but ends up to doing just that regardless of it's theme.

24 July 2023,Good Will Hunting,"""Will"" (Matt Damon) is a rudderless character who works as a caretaker. He's an attitudinal pain in the neck whom, aside from his best friend ""Chuckie"" (Ben Affleck), is pretty much shunned by everyone. ""Professor Lambeau"" (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) spots some potential in this wayward lad, especially when he realises that he has an amazing ability to solve mathematical problems. To that end he sends him to see the eccentric psychologist ""Sean"" (Robin Williams) who proves remarkably adept at cutting down the young man's defences and at beginning to rebuild the character of the man in a more positive and life-affirming fashion. The film combines some excellent performances from all four men, but especially a bang on-form Williams as the penetrative, but flawed, route to salvation for an equally flawed and angry almost younger version of himself in the genius ""Will"". Damon is entirely convincing as his temper and his prodigious nature are juggled adeptly and aided by a powerful script that allows the actors to take and keep centre stage as the potency of the plot becomes more and more focussed, we are presented here with a ground-breaking and thought-provoking look at what makes a great teacher as well as what makes a human being tick, what makes one happy and fulfilled - and what makes one the opposite! For my money, Gus Van Sant's finest interpretative work and well worth watching a few times, for more detail emerges to appreciate each time you see it.",7
21 June 2020,decent for an older movie,"This is a pretty good movie for the most part. i like the characters and robin williams was awesome. the only parts i didn't enjoy were the romance scenes. and it's not because the love story was unnecessary like in many movies. it played a function in the story. it just wasn't done very well. there are also some parts i thought were stupid (about 2 viewings, 6/20/2020)

16 January 2020,"Even if your heart is made out of stone, it will still melt by this terrific coming of age tale. One of kind! Deservedly Oscar winner!","Hadnt seen this movie in decades and I remembered it as a somewhat cheesy, sentimental story, how wrong my memory was though, because this movie is without a doubt a blokes movie. Not cheesy at all. But is simultaneously quite touching, uplifting and most of all TRUE to LIFE. Terrific true to life dialogues! Really magnificent.

This movie was Matt Damon's and Ben Affleck's SUDDEN rise to fame. They WROTE the damn thing, at their very young age. Please do watch the Oscar speech on youtube, these two young guys held when they won the Oscar for best screenplay. It's vivacious and hilarious!

The story is simple: Matt Damon is a super smart whizzkid, one of the smartest in the world, but emotionally he is a messed up kid, because of his coldhearted upbringing as an orphan. The brilliance of this story is the bond he gets with psychiatrist Robin Williams, who for the first time ever, teaches the vulnerable Matt Damon how to really love someone...May sound corny, but it definitely isnt. This is a blokes movie, which women would love as well.

What a brilliant coming of age tale! Just so profoundly touching, that I got all teary eyed at the end and I am not quickly moved by a movie whatsoever. It is not cheesy or sentimental though. That's the great thing about this story: it's a guys tale what it's like to be a guy, who is tough and cool, but who is unable to truly love someone...",9
27 November 2018,"Well made and well acted, but ultimately not my cup of tea.","Let's face it: I hated mathematics at school and still do today, so the film didn't appeal to me in that sense, but it appealed to me in respect of life's lessons. I also enjoyed the film due to Robin Williams, whom I just love as an actor. This was a very dramatic and emotional role for him, which he did brilliantly. Matt Damon was also very good and believable as the young rebel. Ben Affleck's character was unnecessary and mostly silly and I found he ruined the scenes where he was present (although the character does give the best advise towards the end). Minnie Driver was also excellent as the love interest Skylar. She really gave a powerful performance.

As expected, although interesting, the film became dreary to a point where I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. Due to the film's long running time, the events in the film didn't capture my attention enough to satisfy my movie experience needs. It did have a satisfying ending, though, as both Will Hunting and the psychologist (Robin Williams) gained from their sessions.

'Good Will Hunting' is regarded as one of the top rated films of all time (and, yes, I can understand why), and won numerous awards including two Oscars.

This is a film I'll probably never watch again, regardless of how well made and well acclaimed.",7
3 August 2001,Didn't work for me,"In order for this film to work you have to possesss some sympathy for Matt Daiman's character. I didn't so I didn't care for the movie. Basically he was an ass. I did like Robin Williams however and would say that his performance adds a redeeming quality to a rather sophomoric script.

25 September 2018,Watch it for Williams turn as the mentor.,"One of the finest performances of Robin Williams Good Will hunting is a good film with an impeccable script by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Robin Williams is great as the tutor and won the best supporting actor for the role. Gus Van Sant has a great track record and he is very good here. If you like strong hard hitting films with a lesson than you cannot go wrong with Good Will Hunting.

10 September 2016,"A Touching, Inspiring & Emotionally Dense Drama Steered By Stellar Performances From Robin Williams & Matt Damon","Winner of two Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay, Good Will Hunting is written by two of the biggest stars working in Hollywood industry today and is an emotionally dense drama that manages to as inspiring as it is touching and is further uplifted by stellar performances from both Matt Damon & Robin Williams.

Good Will Hunting tells the story of a young man who works as a janitor at MIT and happens to be remarkably gifted at mathematics. When his talent is discovered by the professor whose advanced problems he's been solving anonymously, he takes him under his wing and also arranges a therapy session for the troubled man that changes his life.

Scripted by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck, and brought to life on the film canvas by Gus Van Sant, the film follows a predictable route and is consistently paced throughout its runtime but it's the sum of the parts than the whole package that makes it an engaging ride. Few moments brim with powerful emotions while it falls flat on other occasions but it does enough to steer itself past the finish line.

The technical aspects are finely executed, Danny Elfman's score is truly mesmerising but Good Will Hunting excels most in the acting department. The cast comprises of Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Ben Affleck & Minnie Driver, with Damon & Williams impressing the most. Their individual performances are no doubt strong but it's their excellent chemistry with each other that turns out to be this film's highlight.

On an overall scale, Good Will Hunting is a wonderfully crafted journey about a troubled young man who learns to confront his past & move towards a more promising future and also paints a heartfelt portrait of an unlikely friendship that develops between two unexpected individuals. The story is at its best when the screen is shared by a therapist who approaches his patients in a grounded manner and his latest client who's unwilling to open up to anyone. Worth a shot.",
10 October 2020,A Moving and Engaging Film,"A fantastic mix of drama, humour, brashness, sorrow, trauma, hope and possibilities make Good Will Hunting a very captivating movie.

The story itself is a little cliched, the person who should never be able to achieve X, can and does. What makes the movie work so well is the performances combined with the rounded characters that make you care about the outcomes for each of the characters of the film.

Never boring, always delivering, Good Will Hunting will not disappoint :)

13 August 2023,"A very good film, but with some flaws and problems that deserve attention.","This film is about a boy from Boston, who comes from very poor backgrounds, but who has a gift for mathematics, easily solving theorems and advanced problems that leave Harvard professors unanswered. He is discovered after solving one, at night and without telling anyone, and one of the professors at the university decides to help him be someone and make use of his gift. The problem is that he doesn't want to, he's not able to trust anyone, and he's seriously stuck with justice. Therefore, he will recruit an irreverent psychiatrist to try to help the boy.

The film's premise is very good, and the story has merits that we cannot ignore or minimize. It's one of those delicious movies to watch, that leaves us without feeling the time that passes. We really know that guy is not a bad person, but it's not easy to like the character due to his options and his bad social attitude. However, what bothered me the most was the construction of Robin Williams' character and his whole way of acting and accompanying that patient. I think anyone who has ever had the need to see a psychiatrist knows that they have strict rules about what they can and cannot do, and Williams' character breaks a good number of them.

And this leads us to talk about actors. I really enjoyed Williams' work, but he is a long way from the best that the actor has given us. Matt Damon also did a good job, perhaps one of the best of his career, and one that opened more doors for him in his professional life. Stellan Skarsgard also intelligently took advantage of the opportunity to impose himself on the American cinematic scene, with a job well done and of great merit. Minnie Driver also did an interesting job, perhaps even more so than Ben Affleck, whose character doesn't have as much visibility or relevance.

Technically, the film has many merits, starting with the excellent cinematography, a good set of sets and interesting costumes. The effects are understated, but they work quite well, and the soundtrack also does a pretty good job. It is not, however, a film that stands out for its technical aspects, nor could it be. The important thing in this film is the story it brings us and the work of the cast.",9
5 April 2004,A Feel Good film with the best script!,"I recently watched it after a four year absence and thought very highly of it. I wasn't to keen at first a while back but I have matured and understood what the film was trying to get across and thought it was very clever the way they did it. Without the acting in this then their would be no Good Will Hunting and I wouldn't be reviewing this film now and the same goes for the script. This is one of Ben Affleck's good films and the same has to be said for Matt Damon but I am yet to see a bad Affleck/Damon film, then again I am the only person who hasn't seen Gigli but I will blame J.Lo for that. But the script alone is a masterpiece of writing from both of them. It has the making to make you feel bad and feel good all at the same time without breaking a sweat which brings me on to telling you another reason why I admire this so much. It doesn't stop for a second. Even though there is no big plot to follow and any suspense there is always something happening in each scene of the film which is just terrific for a film of this type. If I was to compare another film made recently to Good Will Hunting then it would be Lost in Translation. Both films have characters who are lost and are afraid and the mood of the film is very bleak if a little up lifting at times. Good Will Hunting just isn't a great drama though, it's also a great comedy as there are many funny scenes where you giggle a lot with anything from Casey Affleck trying to act hard in front of his friends or Robin Williams making funny remarks about everything that surrounds him.

I did feel very emotional towards the end but also uplifted and felt good about myself. I was expecting someone to die in this as it is your typical ending for a story like this one. Though much to my delight Affleck and Damon kept there cool very well and bowed out with a more sombre end with one of the best lines in film for the last Decade said by Robin Williams when he reads the note that will left for him.

Affleck and Damon have more potential than you would think and I look forward to their next pairing as I heard they were getting together to write another script after a number of box office flops. At least if they do we are pretty sure to get something special, so hurry up the both of you before people really turn against you and don't see you for the talent duo that you are.",
5 April 2004,GOOD WILL HUNTING (DIDIER BECU),"Normally I hate films with good messages but this one was different and there are different reasons for it. Just let me tell that I couldn't believe my eyes when I noticed this movie was ranked among the 250 best movies ever as that's certainly not the case as it's the kind of movie you have seen before...

It's the story about some janitor (Matt Damon) who happens to be a math-genius but he prefers to hang out with his friends (Ben Affleck) beating up some guys. Everything changes till he met Sean, a psychiatrist (Robin Williams). Matt Damon plays his role in a perfect way and he could be one of the better actors of these days as he plays the streetguy in a pure James dean/Marlon Brando-way, tons better than Affleck who seems a bit lost here. And finally a normal Robin Williams and it's a shame noticing how great his acting is, how much he can handle and knowing he wasted so many talent in c**p like ""Toys"".

""Good will hunting"" is a great movie that deserves two hours of your time, but not a place in the Top 250.",7
2 January 2015,Worth seeing.,"A movie with great actors, yet an even greater message.

Matt Damon's performance in the movie was excellent, loved his character, Will Hunting was a very unusual guy, gifted with a great mind and memory, but dangerously reckless.

The message this movie had is still relevant to this day. Anyone can easily screw up their life by simply not knowing what they really want. Usually, you have to make the decision of what you are going to be, early in your life, you are 16 - 20 years old, many people fail to find their way and end up disappointed and unhappy for the rest of their lives. That was the case with Will as well, he didn't really care about his insane math skills and hanged out with complete idiots.

Some people need to have someone show them the way, because on many occasions there are very talented people, who are just wasting time on useless studies/things that they don't need or it is just too easy for them.

Not to say, you should do whatever someone else tells you to do, but in Will's case he needed some sort of guidance.",9
29 February 2012,Strong film; recommended,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is.

4 August 2022,Hollow. Hollowood. Hollowood Drivel.,"Apparently this film stirs a wide variety of emotions: from great to sucks. I'm on the lower end.

I've tried watching this three (3) times the past years, but the experience is always more anguish than anything else.

Here's my breakdown:

STORY: If you like ""feel-good fantasy"" then by all means, watch this. If you like iconic actors like Robin Williams and Matt Damon, then watch this. If you love make-believe for adults in the modern age ... watch this. Otherwise ...

This rings hollow, as in ""Hollowood."" And there are my standard and new reasons why: 1. It's so improbable, if not impossible, for this to occur. It's so far out in ""I am high as a kite ..."" land 2. The dialogue and relationships are so cliche I might just puke (but am eating lunch) 3. The plots and characters are predictable long before anything happens

They could have done something out of the ordinary that did NOT include the characters stroking each other (figuratively).

But sadly, contemporary writers are (largely) without genuine creativity, or just really f*ng twisted. So the choices these days are tripe or twisted. I'll take neither.

ACTING: Fine. Boring. Fine. Cliche. Fine. Predictable. Fine. Say something new. Fine.

It's the same faces, same clothes, slightly different script, same places ... just different movies.

They are all fine actors, but that's all they are: fine actors like in the 1930's where everyone did the same thing , most of , the time. Social engineering through film.

ENTERTAINMENT: For the average middle class, white, American this will likely resonate well / high. I'd rather floss.

TEMPO: Fine but predictable

CINEMATOGRAPHY: Fine but predictable

MUSIC / SOUND: Fine but predictable

DIRECTING / WRITING: Director: Most of what Van Sant has done are music videos .... What??? And this is a credential for sound film direction?!

It wasn't a poorly directed film , but I seriously question who was at the wheel here: the director or the actors / writers.

Writers: For Damon and Affleck (and his brother) to both star in and write this ... throws bad signals all over???

This is why I loathed this before I knew who wrote it. As I've said ad nausea, Hollowood loves to promote and praise itself, and this is a great example.

Is it a good film? No, it's drivel. Just drooling with drivel.

Should you watch this once? Yes, and see how far you get (it's a test)

Rating: 4.0 (because it's not horrible, just drivel, and even drivel gets some points)",4

24 May 2019,Excellent job from a couple of Hollywood newbies.,"Good Will Hunting has been acclaimed as one of the most inspirational, tear-jerking films of the late 90's. The script is extremely impressive considering that it came from two Hollywood no-names: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (Well, they were back then anyways).

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did the impossible by delivering a great script while successfully acting in their first big time film. While watching this film, it is easy to tell how genuine the dialogue really is. The dialogue is then capitalized on by great acting from every actor in the film. Matt, Ben, Robin Williams, and the rest of the cast all hit home-runs with their on screen performance. It is easy for the audience to forget that they are watching actors.

It's simple. Unique writing + realistic acting + inspiring story + good cinematography techniques = a darn good movie. Good Will Hunting fulfills that equation easily.

However, the movie does fall a bit short from doing what it could have done . Much of the writing, being focused on realism, did a little too good at its job. Often, we find the screen play diving a bit too deep into dialogue that has little to do with the plot. Sure, its okay to portray the characters and their personalities in their bar-to-bar shenanigans; however, it does not help the flow of emotion that the viewers in the audience need to feel. Simply put, the film lacks balance. If the film had been a bit more efficient with its comical relief and had spent more time developing the emotion of the characters, big emotional moments in the film would have felt even bigger. It is important that a story line flows with balanced progressive emotion until it hits its apex scene. Good Will Hunting's story line simply lacks the flow as the emotional scenes are scattered between scenes of passive unrelated dialogue. This makes the big emotional moments feel a bit over-dramatic when they arrive.

Other than that, this film's screen play his a winning lottery ticket (see what I did there?).

Great movie. I would recommend. I watched this film edited to take out the100+ F-bombs and I still enjoyed it very much.",8

6 August 1998,Embarrassing sentimentality and unappealing characters,"I know I'm against the grain on this one, but I truly hated this movie to the point where I almost walked out. I had absolutely no sympathy for the Matt Damon character. He's not mentally ill, rather he's a spoiled brat who needs a slap on the face. He treats everyone badly through his own self centeredness--the point is we are supposed to believe he has changed at the end. Not to give the ending away, but he's as self centered as ever as the movie closes, and that is what I found so annoying about the story. Indeed, everything in this movie was annoying from the downbeat girlfriend to the mawkish Robin Williams, who spouts some of the most embarrassing dialogue I've ever heard. Yes, I cried all five times I saw Titanic, but this left me totally cold!

7 March 1999,8 on a scale of 10,"Unfortunately, I feel I am in the awkward and depressing position of having to criticize this movie - despite rating it an 8. The reason is because so many people rated it a 9 or 10.

I just couldn't root for anyone in this movie - except for Robin Williams. As I am not a huge Williams fan, that left me somewhat empty. None of the characters were particularly likeable.

Also, the premise was undermined by the fact that NO ONE on this planet can solve world class mathematical problems without training. No matter who you are, you have to know what the symbols mean in order to understand the problem and interpret it and express the answer - right?

Some of the scenes were very good - enough to recommend the movie, but this is a classic movie that I think of as ""well done"". However, if I never hear of it again or see any part of it again, I won't have missed a thing - and neither will you.",8

11 June 2020,A beautiful mentor-student relationship,"Good Will Hunting is a drama movie directed by Gus Van Sant and stars Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser.

This movie shows the relationship of a mentor and student beautifully and will melt your heart. Robin Williams was the perfect choice for the movie in the role of a therapist and did the job exceptionally well. Matt Damon in the role of rowdy genius was superb. Stellan Skarsg√•rd never disappoints.

Screenplay is good and direction is superb. Cinematography is beautiful. The movie is indeed a beautiful movie which will melt your heart.

17 August 2014,Brilliant,"Matt Damon is Will Hunting; an underachieving math prodigy working as a janitor at M.I.T. He is discovered by a professor who, through a series of unusual events, is able to recruit the young genius to work on complex math formulas. Hunting has a severely deprived upbringing, involving foster care and physical abuse. Robin Williams; in his Academy Award winning role, shows up as a sympathetic psychiatrist who is recruited to rescue Will from his many demons. Williams and Damon are excellent, and the script is well written and smart, although it turns a bit too sentimental for my taste at the end of over two hours. Van Zant could have tightened up the editing; noisy bar scenes are always an unnecessary tool; and there are at least one too many in Good Will Hunting. Even with its slight defects, the film is well worth watching.

29 December 2001,"Good quality, intelligent drama - isn't that enough?","I can't really understand some of the adverse comment on this film; it may not be the best ever, but it's way above average. Basically, GWH is a classic (old-fashioned, if you like) character-driven drama, based on an improbable (and therefore interesting) but by no means impossible plot. It is to be welcomed as one of a seeming minority of Hollywood films, not centred on crime or violence, and/or loaded with SFX. But neither is it a smooth-edged fairytale. Director Gus Van Sant, working to a screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, has opted for a realistic context, especially when it comes to Will's roughneck pals. One result of this is the bad language, which apparently offends some viewers. (For the later, superficially similar, Finding Forrester, set in the Bronx, Van Sant seemed to take a more cautious route.)

Damon is excellent as the closet mathematical genius, Will Hunting, who prefers his delinquent lifestyle and the comradeship of his blue-collar buddies to possible academic acclaim. Once again, Robin Williams demonstrates that when cast in a grown-up role he can ditch most of his annoying mannerisms; his portrayal of Sean Maguire, a psychologist able to help others, but unable to help himself get over the death of his wife, is convincing and moving. Affleck as Will's best buddie, and Minnie Driver as Will's rich student girlfriend, have important supporting roles. Each character demonstrates a stage in what seems the main theme of the film - seeking, finding, and keeping hold of, yourself.

One weak spot is that the movie doesn't bring out clearly enough the conflict between Will's ""discoverer"" Prof Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) and Maguire. Lambeau wants Will to gain fame and fortune for the benefit of science (and his own kudos); Maguire is more interested in Will making his own choice, whatever that is. Those who think the film has a neat, happy ending should consider how Lambeau and Maguire will each view Will's action.",
20 May 2016,the cousin of Lip Gallagher (rental),"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",7
24 October 2002,HOW did this thing ever make money???,"I went with my wife to see this in the theater. When the plot failed to go anywhere after an hour, we left.

I finally read the entire script, and haven't changed my opinion. Why should I care that this guy is throwing his life away? If he can't stay out of trouble, they should have just thrown him in jail. End of movie.

21 November 2019,Moving coming of age story - but not for me.,"It is for sure a great movie, me personally wasn't really 'grapped' by it. I appreciate the strong story line and the strong characters which are exposed gracefully. But personally, the story was for me way too slow, way too obvious and way too much cliche (personally! - the lost boy and the grand 'dad' who mentors him...?).

Still, greatly executed. But might not rewatch it.

20 November 2022,Interesting Look at Intelligents and Humanity,"This is a movie that I was late to. I know that I watched part of it after graduating from college, but I realized until watching this with Jaime, my wife, I had never seen this all the way through until now. It is one that I knew was popular from the time that it came out. I didn't connect that this was directed by Gus Van Sant. I've seen a handful of his works and he a bit pretentious. That's not to say he isn't talented.

For this movie, we are following Will Hunting (Matt Damon). He's an orphan who works as janitor at M. I. T. A professor there, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) puts up an extremely difficult math equation to which Will solves easily. When it gets revealed to the professor, he seeks out this young man.

What is interesting here though is that he's from South Boston. He doesn't have much ambition in life aside from drinking beers with his friends, Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Morgan (Casey Affleck) and Billy (Cole Hauser). They also get in the occasional fight. This is what brings Will and Lambeau together. Instead of Will going to jail, he is released to Lambeau¬∏ who wants to help. This also includes getting Will who is proud to see a therapist. This is where Will meets Sean (Robin Williams) who changes his life. Also, Will might have randomly met the love of his life, Skylar (Minnie Driver), if he will let his guard down.

Having now seen this movie all the way through, I get why it is beloved. We have Will who is gifted and yet, due to the cards that life has played him has made him arrogant. I get the vibe that since he's different, he just wants to be 'normal'. The educated people who he meets are in awe of him and want the same life they have for themselves. Will is a person that sees the negative in everything, for good reason, so he'd rather not try. That is until he meets Sean who truly connects with him. I'll be honest, they have conversations that made me tear up. Damon and Williams play off each other so well.

I should then go to the cast since it is stacked. I've already said that Damon and Williams are good. There are also the likes of Skarsg√•rd, who I'm a big fan of. There are both Afflecks and Hauser who is an underrated character actor. There is even Driver who is good here. The cast is good across the board. No one has a bad performance and everyone feels real enough to me.

Then all that is left to go into would be the filmmaking. This is shot well. It captures the feel of Boston from the little townie areas to Harvard. That is good. I do expect this though with cinematography since this is directed by Van Sant. A gripe I normally have when movies run over two hours it that it is too long. I don't feel the runtime at all. The only other thing is the soundtrack, which is fine. This is an excellent movie in my opinion and would recommend a viewing if you haven't.

My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8
15 March 2008,One of the most deeply and essentially human films ever,"Perhaps the only thing that's beyond normal in ""Good Will Hunting"" is the fact that Will Hunting is a mathematical genius. The rest is about as real as a film can get while still being interesting. To be two hours about a young man and his issues and to be so good says a lot about the acting and the writing of this film: that it's very, very good.

""Hunting"" stars Matt Damon as the title role, the enigma that is Will Hunting. Damon is so good at capturing the broad spectrum of his character's emotions. Hunting is written to be a psychological head case who thinks he's figured out what life's about and what people are about and Damon really shows you that. It's a role that would seemingly be played by Leonardo Di Caprio, but we all know what he was busy doing in 1997.

Hunting is a janitor at MIT and when he starts solving some of the most difficult of math equations, he gets discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard). Because Hunting is an orphan and spends most of his time around South Boston getting into trouble with his friends, the plot gets moving when the professor agrees to get Hunting out of jail time with the exceptions that he spend time on math with him and that he go to therapy. After therapy with several top shrinks fails, Hunting is taken to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and the two form a unique relationship. The film is in general about the psychological and social journey of Hunting as he begins to understand what life's really all about.

Just as good as Damon though are Skarsgard and of course Robin Williams, who is in a role that seems perfect for him, or at least he makes it his own very much so in this film. His character is so honest, but also very poignant and funny.

It's a simple concept really. You tell the story of a genius who was orphaned and abused as a child and you have a story of untapped potential and of letting go of the past to embrace the future. Damon and Affleck, who are responsible for the film's intelligent screenplay simply tell this in a really complex way, showing it through the relationship between Will and Sean, Sean and Professor Lambeau, and even Will and his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck). There's a very wide spectrum and experience there. Sometimes the dialogue does seem a bit too elitist and literary, but most of the time it's natural and just meaningful. Gus Van Sant adds some touches of his own, but this is mostly about the story and the characters, so he succeeds at his job of letting it be about them.

""Good Will Hunting"" might now blow you out of the water, but it's touching because it's so human and because the characters could be any of us. Will is the extreme (lonely poor orphan math genius), but we all identify with extremes better in some way, and that's what makes this film successful.",8
28 January 2018,Arrogant genius learns facts about life,"The story of this movie begins with Matt Damon still in Harvard. He wrote the initial script for this movie as a class assignment. Later on he would recruit Ben Affleck to finish the script with him. And thus one of the most well-known films ever made was born.

And for such a humble beginning, the movie is much better than it has any right to be.

The story tells about Will Hunting (Damon), who's a mathematical savant and an all-around genius. Unfortunately he comes from the wrong side of the tracks in Boston and has thus ended up working as a janitor in MIT's math department. Until one day he's caught scribbling on the hallway blackboard. Scribbling such math that even the professors have a hard time keeping up.

The film isn't very heavy plot-wise. Rather it's the characters, these huge personalities played by talented actors, that make the film such a memorable classic. In Hunting you can definitely see clear signs that he was written by a schoolboy, but his problems are treated in a mature way and given enough depth that you care. The movie has some good thoughts about being gifted and the meaning your starting point in life has on your choices.

Plus the film has Robin Williams in it. This is not in fact one of his better roles, at least in my opinion, but the man was such a talent that even three fourths of his maximum effort was more than most could conjure up combined.

This film is best seen as a teenager. As an adult you can be a bit annoyed by Hunting's clear Gary Stu tendencies and the wish fulfillment talents, but even then it is more than a watchable experience and a neat piece of film making.",7

28 September 1998,Great acting swimming against the current of a fairy story,"Robin Williams should have been the centre of this movie as he struggled to swim upstream against the tide of an emotionally and morally immature story.

I am really not sure how this movie can be so popular: it is a fairy story about growing up which isn't grown up at all: at every opportunity for deep and revealing conflict at the emotional and intellectual level, the script ducks. Thank God Williams and the others strain to keep their heads above the water.

Maybe as a modern fairy story this succeeds for the very same reason other fairy stories are successful. They offer not a view of life, love and growth but an escape from the same struggles we all face.

Yep, this movie ends with the hero driving into the sunset.

Wouldn't y'know.",3
8 June 2012,A compelling drama,"Back in 1997 a small film made the name of two young actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who were so frustrated about their lack of opportunities wrote their own screenplay so they could star in the film, earning them a Oscar win at the same time.

Will Hunting (Damon) is genius with a troubled past. He is working as a janitor at M.I.T. when he solves a maths formula that is meant to challenge the best students at the university. Will is also on probation after he hit a cop. Mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) takes Will under his wing, seeing the potential in him to do whatever he wants and gets his friend Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to counsel the young man. Will also meets Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British Harvard student and starts a relationship with her. But Will is his also his own worst enemy.

Screenplay is really strong and you can see why Ben Affleck has become a respected director. It was a dialogue driven film that focuses on a character who is troubled, who has a tremendous give but is bitter towards people who had the wealth and luxury to go to university. He is also a man who does not know how lucky he is that people care about him and does not realise how lucky he is with his intelligence. There is a great cast who give authentic performances, Damon, Skarsgard, Williams (who won an Oscar for this role) and Driver in the main roles. There are not good guys or bad guys, they are shares of grey with all of them and the real antagonist is Will to himself. Skarsgard and Williams' characters have different approaches and views about Will but they both have his best interests at heart. Will starts off as a real jerk and I personally enjoyed it when Williams' character does get to give Will a telling off.

Gus Van Sant could have made visually safe film but he was able to inject a style to the film, using hand-held cameras for long shots and panning shots and edited TV footage from a famous Red Sox game whilst Sean tells Will the story about how he met his wife. Van Sant to able to make sure all the different stories involving Will's life all get a fair amount of screenplay and it is easy to follow who is who and what is happening. He is actually better a mainstream director then when he makes indie flicks.

There are a few scenes that do not work, particularly when Will sends his friend (Affleck) to be pretend to be him for a job interview which was played for humour but it was just felt out of place.

Good Will Hunting is a compelling drama with a story worthy to tell. It is worth checking out and for a dialogue heavy film it still keeps your attention.",8

15 September 2014,Psychiatrist as hero.,"This is an intense movie and includes many strong performances, capped off by Robin Williams's, which is probably the best cinema performance of his career. The movie deals with a lot of social and psychological themes - denial, repression, social marginalization, self-esteem, love - without becoming corny or a spoof. That is, the story can be taken seriously, and for Hollywood, which has a track record of reducing event he most complicated issues to the most simplistic level, this is a major accomplishment. The title character, Will, played admirably by Matt Damon, really serves as a metaphor for every person unable to actual their potential. Minnie Driver's performance is especially powerful, but this is Robin Williams's movie. His performance as the treating psychiatrist who is able to break through Will's resistance and defenses may be the positive portrayal of a mental health therapist in cinema history. This movie should be watched by anyone who is interested in mental health and by the public in general because this movie is about us.

21 May 2023,"A moving and touching movie! Ths film It's about friendship, about how people can be saved by others, about how a word, a conversation, can be comforting, inspiring","The script has the merit of bringing in its very well-developed narrative structure a collection of striking dialogues, such as when Sean recalls how he met his beloved wife and in his amusing recollection of the couple's idiosyncrasies, being also responsible for creating and developing ambiguous and complexes like Will and Sean himself, escaping the pitfalls common to this type of film, which usually seeks easy crying through Manichaean plots in the story. Not here: the situation builds up little by little, slowly, until, finally, we realize that something has changed. And that's precisely what's most interesting about Matt Damon's script and performance. His Will Hunting, an extremely troubled and arrogant young man, is changing so slowly that we are not able to perceive this transition until it is practically affected. Damon's acting is subtle, powerful. The scenes where he discusses love, sex, fate and loneliness with Robin Williams are perfect.

By the way, once again Williams proves that, with a good script at hand, he is capable of doing wonders. Here, he combines two of his previous roles: the doctor from Awakenings and the professor from Dead Poets Society. From this he has the ease of communication with young people, the ability to transmit great lessons as if they were bar philosophy. From that he brings solitude and introspection. A wonderful performance worthy of the Oscar for supporting actor at the 1998 awards. Likewise, even secondary characters such as Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Skylar (Minnie Driver) and Professor Gerald Lambeau gain enough space to demonstrate their characteristics and humanize themselves in front of the spectator, which only enriches the narrative and brings them closer to the audience. Thus, the viewer finds himself hooked by the plot and interested in the characters before he even realizes how this happened.

While Casey Affleck's expendable Morgan is the jester of the class, with idiotic questions and childish behavior, Damon and Affleck (still very young) make up more complex characters, behaving like real teenagers at times, but creating a convincing bond of friendship thanks to the good chemistry between them. Empathizing also with Minnie Driver and especially with Robin Williams, Damon gives a memorable performance as the genial and emotionally out of control Will, always speaking quickly but with clarity and conviction, as in the great bar scene where he meets and impresses Skylar, imposing himself intellectually on a stranger and conquering the girl through his rare intelligence. Living as a typical underdog, Damon is always reactive, using his aggressiveness as a defense mechanism to try to ward off the suffering caused by his traumatic childhood.

Minnie Driver's friendly Skylar, on the other hand, rarely manages to overcome Will's defensive armor, but she doesn't give up on him and the couple even manages to empathize in fun moments like flirting in a bar that generates the first kiss. However, the social differences between them (he, an orphan from the suburbs, she, heir to a good amount of money) end up generating a strong discussion, in which the two actors do very well. While Driver demonstrates how much Skylar suffers from not being able to contain Will's momentum, Damon dryly demonstrates how aggressive he can be when cornered. Will is a complex character, who is afraid of relating and getting hurt and, therefore, is unable to say that he loves her - which leads us to the touching scene in which she holds back tears when talking to him on the phone without being able to get the three most desired words among couples.

Closing the highlights of the cast, the fatherly professor Lambeau lived by Stellan Skarsgard finds in Will what he could not be. Although he has everyone's recognition for his mathematical knowledge, he did not earn the respect of those who mattered most: himself. Frustrated at seeing so much potential wasted, Lambeau can't hide his disappointment - and Skarsgard's constantly haggard expression conveys this feeling very well. In his view (and Chuckie himself, Will's best friend), it's a shame to see such a brilliant boy wasting his life. But Sean doesn't see it the same way, which leads us to an interesting reflection on the concept of ""success"". Award-winning and successful, Lambeau was never able to reach the peace and complete happiness that Sean achieved while living with the woman he loved.

Incidentally, all interpretations of this film have the subtlety in the approach of the characters as their main feature. Nobody here seeks to stand out or make their character ""flashier"". No: they are all discreet, which ends up giving the film an even greater reality. Thus, when they are actually forced to scream, cry or, in short, show a stronger emotion, it is as if someone we know is really suffering. And that's what plays, in ""Good Will Hunting"". The plot convinces us about each relationship treated there. About each conflict, everything is very sensitive, very human, it touches us apparently in a subtle way, but when we least realize it we are suffering inside, suffering for these great characters, extremely well written and very well interpreted. There is, certainly, relaxation, clearly a work made by friends, by people who know each other, there is a naturalness in each scene, in each dialogue, and thus, we quickly feel fond of each situation.

Aware that the strength of the narrative is concentrated in the script and the cast, the technical team led by Gus Van Sant avoids drawing too much attention, doing a discreet and efficient job. Thus, director of photography Jean Yves Escoffier seeks to enhance golden tones most of the time, especially when Will is reasoning, in a visual illustration of how valuable that enlightened boy's gift is. Yellow, by the way, is present in many scenes, whether through the objects selected by Melissa Stewart's production design to decorate Sean's office or even Beatrix Aruna Pasztor's costumes (notice Sean's shirt in the first conversation with Will, by example). In turn, the soundtrack by Danny Elfman highlights the melancholic mood of the feature through its beautiful music and inspired instrumental compositions, while Pietro Scalia's montage prints a good rhythm when moving between sessions and the less than glamorous everyday life. Of Will, alternating also in the use of dry cuts - as occurs during a dinner between Lambeau and Sean in which Will's friends suddenly appear fighting - and elegant transitions, as in the sequence in which Will explains why he would not work for ASN, when he starts talking at the company and, with his face in close-up, continues the speech, but now in Sean's office.

Gus Van Sant is smart and trusts the script and his actors and gets the camera as close as possible to his characters. The director understands that he doesn't need anything fancy to make the viewer buy that story and get involved with those people. It helps that even though we are talking about characters with one foot in the extraordinary (at least four of them are extremely intelligent), there are flaws and character deviations that bring them closer to someone ordinary. It's as Sean so eloquently teaches his patient: ""You're not perfect. And I'm going to spoil a surprise: this girl you met isn't either."" The woman mentioned by the doctor is Skylar (Minnie Driver), a Harvard student who proves to be an ideal partner for Will, even though he has trouble admitting this possibility. And the perfect ending still ties up the loose ends of the narrative very well, concluding the dramatic arc of Will and Sean in a fully satisfying way in the emotional scene in which the therapist convinces the boy that ""he is not to blame"". Both acknowledged their shortcomings. Both were brave enough to face them. And the most interesting thing is that this happens so subtly that they don't even realize how much they are changing. Subtlety is perhaps the word that best defines ""Good Will Hunting"". Just as Will Hunting doesn't notice the moment he starts to change; the viewer also doesn't notice the moment he is hooked by the narrative. It just happens.

The film is full of great ideas, it is one of those that can be seen and interpreted in different ways, each person will take something with them, it is a work that leaves traces, makes us think and reflect on many things. It's about friendship, about how people can be saved by others, about how a word, a conversation, can be comforting, inspiring. It is also worth analyzing the development of Will Hunting, the one who avoids his own growth, his aggressiveness, his madness, it is a response to his fear, fear of admitting his own genius, more than that, fear of disappointment and that was just what limited him, fear of being let down, either when he fails to accept Lambeau's plans, or when he avoids a deeper relationship with Skylar. ""Indomitable Genius"" is the beautiful proof that the answer to a full life is not in books, the answer to that is in day-to-day life, it is in coexistence, in human relationships, that there is a difference between intelligence and knowledge, that an individual is not only composed of the theoretical knowledge he acquired, his knowledge is related to what he acquired in life, with the achievements, losses and the wisdom to deal with all of this. And that success is not necessarily achieved by a degree.

Anyway, the direction of Gus Van Sant, given the dimensions of the script and the performances, is much less felt, almost innocuous within a film on the verge of perfection. Indomitable in any case, is characterized as a work with a unique effect on its spectator, see the beauty of cinema in reaching everyone in the most different ways. We are certainly facing those experiences that can change lives.",8
4 June 1999,Not bad...,"In general, this movie is very good. Boston (and Cambridge) are faithfully rendered; this movie brings across the feel of these places very well. The acting was pretty good, and the dialogue was great. I only have one complaint about this movie, and it's a big one: this movie is very predictable. I don't think there was a single plot point that didn't telegraph itself a good half hour ahead of time. The plot has as many twists and turns as the highway between Fort Worth and Dallas. But if you don't mind predictability, you'll probably like this movie a lot.

Kudos on a minor point. Being a kind of amateur linguist, and a native of Boston's northern suburbs, I've often noticed how badly movies and television shows misrepresent the distinctive Boston accent. Well, this movie got it right for the most part. My compliments to the dialect coach. (Robert Easton didn't have anything to do with this, did he?)

26 October 1999,Not Bad,"The constant profanity jarred rather than added realism, and did little more than distract and make it seem the actors were trying much too hard. Though Will may have been a genius, but the writers sure are not. The formulas in this film are familiar to any 2nd Year maths student in university. The performances and direction, however, are very appealing, turning the cliched and typical plot into an enjoyable film.

11 June 2015,Robin Williams best performance thanks to an incredibly solid script.,"""I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you.""

The scene where Robin Williams' Sean Maguire sits on a park bench with Matt Damon's Will Hunting to have their little shrink session about life, love, and identity is perhaps my favorite cinematic moment ever. More than a conversation, it is a monologue that Robin Williams delivers with incredible passion and it gives me goosebumps every time I watch this scene. It's the reason why he won an Academy Award for best supporting actor and why the film works as well as it does. This is just one fantastic moment, but I can think of many more scenes that left me completely in love with the movie. Like the scene where Sean Maguire and Stellan Skarsgard's Prof. Lambeau have their long awaited discussion about ego and missed opportunities (""You think I'm a failure. I know who I am, and I'm proud of what I do. I was a conscientious choice, I didn't ef up! And you and your cronies think I'm some sort of pity case. You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around going, ""The Fields Medal! The Fields Medal!"" Why are you still so efin' afraid of failure?""), the scene where Sean narrates Game 6 of the World Series to Will, which he passed on for the opportunity to meet his future wife (I just slid my ticket across the table, and I said, ""Sorry, guys; I gotta see about a girl.""), and of course the final scene between Will And Sean which I don't want to spoil. There are just so many great moments in this film thanks to the strong performances and the amazing screenplay from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is one of my favorites. Even the scenes between Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and between Damon and Minnie Driver are incredible and I still have to leave them out of my top five favorite scenes in this movie because there are just so many. And I even left out Will's amazing monologue about why he shouldn't work for the N.S.A. It's simply one of the best written movies ever and it has Robin Williams best performance (that is saying a lot considering how much I loved his work in Dead Poet's Society, Good Morning Vietnam, and The Fisher King).

""You're not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you've met, she's not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other.""

I don't know if Good Will Hunting is a perfect film, but I know it is perfect for me and for that reason it will always be included as one of my all time favorite films up there with The Sixth Sense and The Dark Knight. I have plenty of other favorites which I sometimes include in my top ten, but those three are always at the very top of my list, and I don't even worry about having to discuss it with anyone else.",10
25 May 2023,What a movie,"I love this movie and I love how it writes itself into existence. The opening dialogue and the characters and how they interact with each other. There is a magic about it that really hits home. Like applying to get into school for example. Building the careers of two writers as a boon to the industry for itself. The fun the film shows and the sadness of being human. But the joy comes after the sadness and the build it is really spectacular. This is a film class in it of itself of being both entertaining and beautiful. The work that went into deserves praise as well as the acting. Robin Williams...

7 January 1999,An over-rated drama for popular culture,"It's very predictable that a movie like this would soon be placed into that undefined category of ""good"" recent movies, which includes any film having the smallest bit of sincerity and meaning. The fact that the popular trend is toward the visual and that special effects are replacing plots and subtle nuances tends to lead the average viewer to the opinion that any film that attempts these is a grand effort. This is not true. ""Good Will Hunting"" does not even have a well-defined plot, but that fits into the movie acceptably: it's an extraordinary man's search for himself through love, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. The premier problem is that the movie overplays it's best card: Matt Damon's(character's) incredible brain. There is a certain point at which the audience should halt its fascination at his mental profencies and sigh in boredom. It's unfortunate that this was not the case for most theaters. Though the meaning of life and gifted individuals are good themes for movies, they are not original, and this ""tear-jerker"" makes no unique contributions to either idea. In fact, if you want to see real meaning in a popular movie, rent ""Rocky"", a title which many supposed ""film experts"" would probably not want to admit conveys deeper human meaning than most ""good"" movies, like (appropriately) Good Will Hunting. Shame on you, movie fans, for falling in love with such a butchered attempt at profundity.",3
15 February 2018,All the cast were fine Except....,"Minnie Driver, who played the role Skylar. An absolutely miscast. She was totally out of place in this film. For Will Hunting, played the role by Matt Damon, she's too old, too BIG and even got moustache. I've never heard any young female actor whose laughters so terrible, sounded more like an old hag, so repellent and so disgusting. Her British accent also felt so out of place in this film. Every scene involved her image was simply too painful to watch. Just horrible a viewing experience. If there's some kind technique that I could wipe or block out her images in this film, it would be perfect. Her KAKAKA weird old witch-like laughter haunted me and gave me nightmares, man.

How could she pass the audition, signed up for this Skyler character? Don't say ""It's not your fault!""

27 December 1998,Abundance of interesting characters in a polished film,"I was very surprised at the variety and depth of the characters in the GWH script. (This is after all a Hollywood movie.) Several of them (Robin Williams, Minnie Driver and Affleck and his friends) could have been the center of their own movies.

Also it is rare when a brat pack type of film does a good job handling adult issues, as was done with William's and Skarsgard's characters coming to terms with what is success, commitment as well as pride and jealousy.

The therapist client relationship which can be so off base to be a joke as in the ""Prince of Tides"" had a semblance of reality to it. The intense issue of child abuse was dealt with very briefly but in a fairly honest way.

In a sense the story about the Matt Damon character being very bright was not that interesting to me. What I responded to were these characters trying to reach out and connect. This is overall a very polished package by the film makers, including fine acting - making GWH a positive experience.",7
1 September 2018,Some good touches but overall silly and cringy,"This is not a good movie. Let's make that clear from the beginning. The writing, which intentionally carry the whole package, it's barely mediocre. Some banter resembles that of shows like Young Sheldon, and not the good episodes. Other dialogues are so over the top, so vehemently direct and so unaware of the circumstances that one has to cringe or laugh in reaction. At one point in the story the movie seems to forget the concept of narrative progression. And oh boy, don't let me start about the ridiculous and self-indulgent plot. Do I have to mention how inconsistent it is? Or how stupid? Just from the get go. Anyway, is not that awful and there's a couple of thought provoking lines here and there, and Robin Williams is good, so all hope is not lost. The direction has its moments in which just walks away to make the character writing shine, and that would be acceptable in a better movie, but not here. The mood, I think, is an obvious choice; intimate and tranquil. The music, however, seemed tiresome to me.

7 December 2006,The girl Lamot is talking to out side the first psychologist's office,"OK, I have to know who the girl is sitting on the floor listening to the prof talking about how beautiful a mathematical proof can be and she goes ""Wow!"" Every time I see her I go ""Wow"" too, and you can only see her profile.

Who is that stunning long-legged blonde goddess? If those lines really can pull birds like that then I wanna be a maths geek too. She must be mine!

So if anyone has her name or her number or email or home address, I'm pretty sure she's waiting for me to get in touch, so do us a favour.

After all, it's always possible that she's not really after a maths professor but is really saving herself for a broke Australian high school teacher.

cheers

31 December 2021,Good* not Great Will Hunting,"Although the production, writing and acting were exceptional, this movie still lacked something exciting. It just wasn't as inspirational as I think people think it is and I was bored at times. Regardless, very well done movie and still worth the watch.

11 August 2018,Robin Williams is excellent and this film will make you tear up,"Good Will hunting is a good film with an impeccable script by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Robin Williams is great as the tutor and won the best supporting actor for the role. Gus Van Sant has a great track record and he is very good here. If you like strong hard hitting films with a lesson than you cannot go wrong with Good Will Hunting.

10 February 2006,Incredible but authentic,"This is the incredible story of Will a working class young boy who besides working as a janitor first and in the building construction afterwards, is also a genius in mathematics and several other scientific fields which he learned all by himself. But simultaneously he is a petty delinquent for which he has already got a criminal record mainly for assaulting other people in street fights with the likes of him. Despite being a real genius he is also an insecure boy fearing life and love due to the very unhappy childhood he had, which makes it very hard that he can take advantage of his intellectual ability. It also leads him to be rude to those who want to help him since he doesn't trust anybody. All through the movie we see the work of the two men who try to bring him to life and to take conscience of his own value: a maths professor and above all a psychiatrist who had his own problems in life too. This is shown in a brilliant way in terms of players' performances, images and dialogues with deep analysis of feelings and behaviours. All the players are excellent. A special reference to Minnie Driver as the boy's girlfriend with her spiritual and intelligent look and her moving reactions to some of Will's difficult to understand attitudes. This story is genuine indeed in terms of sentiments and actions and very well put on film. One of the best movies of its year.",8
18 March 1999,The praise about Good Will Hunting does not make sense!,"If I had to summarize this film in a sentence, I'd say that it's an overrated, predictable `self discovery drama set on the East Cost with a bit of romance and the dialogue of a Quentin Tarantino movie.' Surprisingly enough, an affiliate of the big Q himself (Lawrence Bender) co-produced it.

There's nothing to really `give away,' so I'll just say this: If this guy was a `repressed genius,' then why did he wait to show it when he got the job as a janitor? How did this person become a genius in the first place? Why didn't they just send the guy to a mathematician, so his name would go into the history books next to Galileo and he might know the secret behind the universe? More importantly, why should we care about this person in the first place? Personally, I'd rather see a movie about a street flasher who targets the elderly. That is saying very, very little.

The `self discovery'....`midlife crisis'....'I need to get my life back together' genre has been used so many times it's about as cliched as the standard Hollywood action film. That is the case with `Good Will Hunting,' a movie whose only sole purpose is to keep the halfway intelligent person alert. If you thought this movie was excellent, well, I don't know what else to say, except a recommendation to over 50 other cliched movies that also got an excellent review for no reason.

Robin Williams' performance was increasingly mediocre to have won an Oscar, he did so much much better in `The Fisher King' and `Dead Poets Society.' The screenplay was just OK, and it also did not deserve an Oscar. Who picked Danny Elfman for the musical score? I thought I was listening to Yanni after his orchestra members consumed a box of laxatives. And the love interest with Minnie Driver just did not work. In fact, it ruined the movie. A little trivia for you, Damon and Driver did not get along with each other in real life during filming.

Don't see it if you want something new. I would have spanked myself with a frozen drumstick if this film won a best picture Oscar.",
23 December 2001,Promising screenwriting debut but an overrated movie.,"A good piece of screenwriting by young cast members Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but one that I don't think will stand the test of time. Matt Damon's (Will) performance as the troubled working-class genius in need of guidance is excellent. However, I think that this was too much of a feelgood movie and an endorsement of counselling, for it to be a truly great film. I found Minnie Driver's (Skylar) expressionless English accent thoroughly irritating and it destroyed, for me, the possibility of the romance between Will and Skylar being interesting.

The performances of Robin Williams (Sean Maguire) and Stellan Skarsgard (Professor Lambeau) are good. The patient-therapist relationship between Damon and Williams is played well by both actors. The films flaw is that it lacks real depth of characterisation. There is a good story in this movie, but it lapses into classical Hollywood slushiness with all ends tied neatly together. Some characters, such as the pseudo-intellectual student who Will runs rings around while chatting up Skylar and a friend, are pretty one dimensional as he is someone we can easily mock and despise, just like the lapdog (what's his name?) who follows Lambeau around.

There are few profundities in this film and I find the idea that therapy is what is needed to help a troubled young prodigy out of his predicament rather spurious. We are also shown how Will's initial hostility to therapy as part of his probation is surrendered. While one would not wish Will to remain an angry young man with no direction, I find the belief that therapy can necessarily mediate the relationship between an individual and society too hard to swallow.",7
27 December 2019,Very well done; now a classic that's worth the watch!,"It may not be the masterpiece some claim it is and it certainly is a bit too melodramatic at times but it's still a very well done movie telling a nice story. By now it has become a classic that's worth watching and make your own opinion about!

15 January 2004,Surprisingly good,"This is a very good film. Apart from the ""apples"" line, that is. Robin Williams gives one of those occasional performances that make you weep for all the wasted time spent on the likes of Flubber, while the other leads match him. For my money, it's the emotional journey of the older men that provides the best value, although Minnie Driver shines in what is easily her best ever role (well, maybe Tarzan).

10 January 2013,Beautiful mind versus beautiful beard.,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9
16 May 2016,excellent script,"Good Will Hunting has as its highlight the excellent map , so that won the Oscar for best original screenplay , the cast is good, Matt Damon , Robin Williams , Ben Affleck and etc , the chemistry of Sean and Will is amazing, Matt Damon is great Robin Williams made a performance that earned him an Oscar , and Ben Affleck is good, the script is amazing and unique, the pace I found median time was a little slow , and I especially did not like the soundtrack , I very bland, taking more that Good Will Hunting is a great, and also proves that even Ben Affleck not be a great actor, has a lot of talent both as a writer as Director .

8 June 2021,So good,"I think this may be Robin William's finest role. His eyes show such caring and such pain, just like his character. Sadly this may not have been completely the character, pointing to the beauty all the more. This story knows what it is, and sticks with it.

10 November 2017,Damon's career defining performance,"'Good Will Hunting' is one of the best known and most popular films of the 90s. It's a powerful, moving drama about an unlikely friendship and features some of the best and most memorable acting performances of that decade, including a career defining performance from Matt Damon as the title character.

It's easy to become emotionally involved in this film as you naturally want the main character to succeed. The friendship he forms with Robin Williams' character is hugely enjoyable and even despite the slow pacing, the story is engaging enough to hold the viewers attention throughout. While not a personal favourite of mine, it's easy to see why 'Good Will Hunting' is loved by so many people, and deserves its reputation as one of the best films of the 90s.

30 July 2018,"""Sorry, I had to go see about a girl.""","Good Will Hunting is an impressive movie on many levels not the least of which is the screenplay written by it's two young actors. One of the best scripts ever to be put on film.

The story revolves around Will Hunting (Matt Damon) an orphan from South Boston who spends his nights bar hopping with his friend Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), and his days working as a janitor at MIT.

There, the illustrious Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgaard) teaches high math to his students. To challenge them, he puts an impossible problem on the board with the promise that whoever solves it will win the prestigious Fields Medal of which he, himself, is a recipient.

When the problem is solved within a week by an anonymous genius, the student body is baffled, and Lambeau sets out to find the elusive prodigy.

He erupts into Will's life just as the latter is about to be sent to prison on an assault charge, and convinces the judge to release the boy into his custody with the condition that he see a therapist.

Will is against the idea, and treats his first five therapists with utter contempt (providing some of the funniest scenes in the movie).

In desperation, Lambeau turns to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) a former roommate with whom he has never gotten along.

With some effort, Lambeau finally coaxes Sean into seeing his new prot√©g√©.

Sean, a widower who has never gotten over the loss of his wife, finds this new patient to be a challenge, while Will realizes he can't play his silly games with this particular therapist, and either has to fish or cut bait.

Adding tremendously to the movie is the presence of Skylar (Minnie Driver) who almost immediately falls in love with Will, and is crestfallen by his inability to admit his own feelings.

Back when the Oscars used to mean something, this movie was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and received two of them which it deserved completely.

This is a movie that has depth, and meaning. There isn't anything that could be added or changed.

It's a perfect little jewel. Flawless in it's execution.

18 September 2023,Robin Williams Penultimate Performance,"Without a doubt, this film is great all around, from the writing, to the acting and directing, but Robin Williams performance in this film can't be beat. In my opinion, its his best role ever, and its not at all a comedy, it has heart and soul. Best performance of his life. I want to remember him like that.

You say Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote Good Will Hunting? Its true, however hard that is to believe. By all means, they turned out a great script and Scott Mozier helped them get it to Miramax, into the hands of Harvey Weinstein of all people. Their acting however, wasn't the best, albeit this was their first major film.

If you love this film, see the spoof in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.

27 January 2021,Shows the work of Psychotherapist,"The work of Psychotherapist is noticable. Everytime I rewatch the movie, I cannot wait to see again the parts with dialogues between Robin Williams and Matt. This movie always gives me a bright feeling of hope and nostalgia. I liked the first date scene, because it was not like other dates that we used to see in movies. I liked that girl from higher society does not think that non-educated and poor people are not as good as she is. I recommend the movie: it has interesting, unique script and talented actors. They caught the right moment, because later one actor died, another got older and I'm glad they managed to make it.

22 June 2020,Harsh Feedback...,"If we are gonna judge movies based on loud cliches like (one of the classics, great legends, etc.) then we are missing the whole image. No one can deny that it is a classic, but not every classic is a great winner- at least for me. Now, Robin Williams has a lovely fitting performance as usual. Matt Demon is good in the movie too. The rest of the characters and actors are useless in the movie! Maybe that maths professor, but the rest are there to swear and curse. Weak repeated plot, boring irrelevant events.

19 August 2014,Good,"Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing, this kind of sentimental character piece needs a tight focus so all of the nuances of the characters shine through. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. The acting is very effective. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Williams is one of the world's supreme artistic talents. It will bring you to tears and make you laugh.

20 December 2021,Good drama with memorable characters,"I didn't have any expectations towards this film. It's just one of those movies of which title and poster is familiar to me from my childhood, and now I want to see all those ""I remember this but don't actually know what it is"" kind of half-nostalgic movies.

Matt Damon plays this very intelligent guy who is also a wild misfit. Robin Williams plays his shrink who tries to help the troubled young man. Ben Affleck is a friend of the main character. Good cast, and the story is well written.

It's good drama with warm and optimistic feel. This is a movie you can watch alone, on a date, or with your mom. Everybody will like it (exept of course somebody who only wants action).

6 August 1998,The best of the worst movies...,"Good Will Hunting could have been a great movie, but it's nothing more than an average movie. It's been hyped up by so many people in the media, that the viewers are actually getting convinced that Matt Damon is the new miracle giving Hollywood new hope and glory, but it is quite the opposite. As an actor I think he's not convincing enough, maybe in the first part of the movie he seems to be able to let you forget he's just an actor, but at the end of the movie he starts to act out his character in such a way it actually brings down all what he did in the first part. As the writer of the screenplay he's not such a star either, again the beginning is okay, but the ending seems like a bad headache after a night of partying. The only truly remarkable thing about this movie is the excellent and undervalued performances by Robin Williams and Ben Affleck. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver should have been the last choices for their characters.

Driver and Skarsg√•rd indeed play an important part in carrying this wonderful story, but it's Hauser and the Affleck Brothers that really help give this modern-day classic the above-par boost that we all remember it for.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9

10 September 2023,A great movie,"""Good Will Hunting"" is a captivating film that delves into the complexities of human emotions and personal growth. The strength of the movie lies in its powerful performances, particularly from Matt Damon and Robin Williams. Their acting brings depth and authenticity to their characters, making the emotional journey feel genuine.

While the movie shines in its exploration of Will's troubled past and his journey towards self-discovery, it does have some weaknesses. The pacing can feel slow at times, and certain scenes could have been trimmed to maintain a tighter narrative. Additionally, the romantic subplot between Will and Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, feels somewhat underdeveloped and lacks the same emotional impact as the rest of the story.

The cinematography captures the essence of Boston beautifully, showcasing both its gritty and vibrant sides. The use of wide shots and intimate close-ups effectively conveys the characters' emotions and the atmosphere of each scene. The music, composed by Danny Elfman, complements the film's tone with its melancholic and introspective melodies.

In summary, ""Good Will Hunting"" is a thought-provoking film with outstanding performances and a compelling exploration of personal growth. While it has its flaws, the strengths of its acting, music, and cinematography make it a must-watch for fans of character-driven dramas.",7
18 August 2021,A Very Touching Emotional Movie,"Since the first few seconds into the movie, i can even already tell that this is going to be a wonderful cinematic masterpiece. They really did great with all the setting, cinematography, color tone, and basically the whole visuals for this movie.

I really love the script. Every lines--especially which said by Will and Sean--always left me kind of strange and awestruck feeling. They builds the whole emotion throughout the film extremely clever and this is one of the movie with the greatest acting performance i've ever seen. I've never seen anything more touching than seeing two actors interact very intimate to each other.

This is about a very much intellegent boy with a traumatic past which leds him to a point where he didn't want to open up and let anyone else close to him aside his friend. He keep denies his own unreal intelligent until one day he met someone who being able to help him find his way in life.

Definately a gold classic. I don't know anymore how to explain what this movie has made me feel. It seems like i can't find the right word to describe such a piece of art like this.",10
5 May 2000,Great Acting + Awesome Screenplay = Excellent Film.,"Good Will Hunting deserves alot more praise than it gets. It only received 2 Academy Awards - it earned about 4 in my opinion! Matt Damon is brilliant, Robin Williams is excellent, Minnie Driver is good, Stellan Skargaard does a great job and Ben Affleck played a strong supporting role.

The film basically follows the story of Will Hunting, a rebel who one day is so bad it leads him up to trouble, and a counseller.

This film is great and If you haven't seen it (highly unlikely) you should rent it from your nearest video store A.S.A.P.

This is definitely in my Top 120.

31 January 1999,A masterpiece.,"Hello you all! I am Daniel Galvalizi. I think this movie is one of the best things that could happen in the movie business in the '90's. Good Will Hunting has a wonderful plot, and was written very well by the admirables B. Affleck and M. Damon. With this script, they showed to the world, that the young people really can make good and creative works. They also show us how's the real will of living, and how a guy can get over his past and be a good man. Of course, Gus van Sant made an excellent work. And the performance of Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Minnie Driver is wonderful. They act very well, and made us feel the movie with love, pain, happiness and tears. Finally, i believe this movie is great, beautiful and all the humanity must watch it. Good Will Hunting is a masterpiece, and does entertainment, though is slow and we got to follow it. The film has the will of hunt audience with a good product, and surely does it.

16 April 1999,Best movie of 1997,"In my mind, there was no movie better then ""Good Will Hunting"" in the year 1997. Yes I thought it was even better than that movie with the boat that sinks in the end. To me this movie was better acted, headed by the mind-blowing performances of Matt Damon and Robin Williams. The greatest special effects in a movie is the skill of the actors, and this movie certainly displayed their actor's skills. It was a touching and very unique movie that has characters that are completely unforgettable.

10 August 2013,Really great movie,"I have just re-watched this movie about 10 years after last seeing it. And I realise now what all the fuss is about. The script is fantastic. And the acting is perfectly judged. The film has so many things going for it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are superb, and they just gel so well on screen. Their gang of friends is lewd and crude but very affectionate and best of all, they swear authentically and talk in native accents. Robin Williams is a strong character as usual but most of the time is quite restrained, and acts well off other characters. Stellan Skarsgaard is perfectly convincing as a wily mathematics professor who is an old friend and rival of Williams' character. Minnie Driver acts well and has some great scenes, but I think her character is too much of ""the love interest"" -- it's a pity. The plot hums along nicely and, all in all, it's a satisfying movie.

29 July 2017,A delightful fiction that looks like a life lesson,"""Good Will Hunting"" is a delightful and inspiring fiction written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who are not only good actors but good writers, And especially, great storytellers. The script tells the story of Will, a young man of 20 years with a past and a troubled present, who is discovered by a renowned mathematician as a genius, even bearer of this incredible tone, the same denies and questions the feeling of life, intelligence , Future, love and society. This questioning present in the film is what shapes his moral, which is to conjecture the sense of friendship and life, to Will friendship defines life, and his best friend makes him see that he has a bright future and that is not worth it The stagnation in exchange for his friendship, thus showing himself, really, a great and faithful friend, love is put on agenda and even the choices of life itself, because sometimes what the heart says is worth more than reason, Even so, the feature gets very focused on Will's character and leaves all those messages aside, including Professor Sean's character, who is fabulous and extremely three-dimensional. The film plays a lot with the camera, we have a lot of zoom in and out, quick cuts and frames changes, and a very expensive gray photograph from the 80s - even the movie being 97 - the soundtrack is little present but director Gus Van Sant plays with visual references and uses the culture to mock the viewer, when smarter, more blind and more being manipulated and lost, is a questionable message, but the film explains it very well for the viewer more attention. Matt Damon looks great on the role, boyish face, and boy pose and he understands his character as few, even because he wrote it himself, wrote it and knew how to live it, it's not a brilliant and out-of- the-way performance, but it's a great Acting of someone who does not even seem to be acting, just living the character, Robin Williams is wonderful, he passes an air of pure peace mixed with remarkable uneasiness, his character is wonderful. Gus Van Sant is one of those full directors, he's not cool, but he dominates the various areas of a set and always does a good job. Finally, ""Indomitable Genius"" is a remarkable film, and a delightful fiction that reads like a life lesson.",8
5 August 1998,"Close, but no cigar","Good Will Hunting is a good movie, no question. It is a long way, however, from a great movie. As I watched the film I honestly enjoyed it and found it credibly done, but as I came away, I had a lingering sense that I had been duped. This movie is not worth all the hoopla (and awards) it garnered, something I can only attribute to Ben and Matt's 'fresh' faces. The story is a long way from original, following fairly predictable routes, some scenes badly expose the immaturity of the writers. Once again, a good movie, not a great movie.

30 October 2020,Interesting movie,"To be honest, I didn't like the first 15 to 20 minutes and I thought it was just going to be one of those boring and confusing movies, but as it went on it started to get interesting. I thought the plot was good and intriguing, however at times the dialogue and terminology that was used was hard to understand at times for me. I also thought the acting was very good in the movie. Overall this is a decent movie, not the best for me but I would still recommend it.

1 July 1999,"Hmm, like MF?","Well, for all of you out there who love the F word and MF, this movie is for you. For anyone who desires a storyline, this one is quite minimal. Who wants to hear the F word for a whole movie? If cursing as well as a bonus of bad actors is a movie to you, then see it. The ironic thing is that I don't mind cursing in a movie so long it's to prove a point; but in this movie, it was meant to be simply crude and I saw no point in it.

The story seemed to open up with a reasonable plot, but went nowhere. I suppose it went downhill the more I saw a preppy type of guy claimed to be a genius, yet making idiotic decisions in life. I'm sorry, but I just can't even imagine Matt Damon as any sort of a genius. (sheesh, even the size of his vocabulary is obviously limited to curse words only)

The reason so many people like this movie has to be because of the big name actors. What teenage girl doesn't want to see Matt Damon? Of course, when he's a main actor in a movie, girls go crazy for him as well as Ben Affleck. With such ""good looking guys"", what girl wouldn't go crazy for it?

The bottom line for this movie is that it's horrible and should realistically be rated NC-17 for the language let alone the horrible acting.",1

6 October 2007,Basic drama writing at its very best,"Will Hunting is a troubled young man who spends his free time hanging around bars and cleaning the floors of a university. However, Will isn't a typical youngster as he has unbelievable mathematic abilities and an outstanding photographic memory. Will soon gets into trouble but a professor who's seen what he's capable of makes a proposition which includes Will to see a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist after another refuses to see Will anymore as he's so uncooperative. Will eventually meets his match, a psychiatrist Sean McGuire, who finally makes Will to open up his mind and think about what he wants to do with his life.

""Good Will Hunting"" is a feel good movie. Though it is kind of a basic drama, it is still drama at its best. This is really what the drama -genre should be, as the film doesn't really go into other genres at all, it follows the pattern of a great drama, but it somehow manages to be surprisingly good. The story's interesting, though it isn't that unique after all, but it captures your attention right from the start. It's just something that's easy for your eyes and it's a real pleasure to watch. You don't feel stressed at any part of the film, every scene matters and there isn't anything unnecessary anywhere. Screenplay's written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and it is indeed very well written and you can really see where they were heading at with it. It hasn't really got any amazing twists and turns, it's just brilliant on its own. I'd like to see Damon and Affleck collaborate some more in the future, as this is what a true drama is really, and after all, about.

The film also includes great role performances, so that may be one of the reasons why it's also so surprisingly good. Matt Damon is great as Will Hunting, the main character. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is perfect for the role of the professor Gerald Lambeau and his role performance is solid. Ben Affleck also does his job flawlessly, and I really think he is in fact a good actor but people just don't seem to get it because of what movies he's been in in the past. He doesn't get the chance of a perfect role for him, but hopefully that will also change in the near future. Just stop slaying the guy and let's see how far can he really go. Minnie Driver fits for the role of Skylar, the girlfriend of Will Hunting, and she has an incredible chemistry with Damon. All of the scenes where they are with each other are really strong and powerful, you can really see or sense these sincere emotions between them. Those scenes really speak for themselves and what is true drama acting at its best, as there happens the unquestionable and respected tearing away the actor from the character itself, which makes it seem like there is no acting involved at all. That's just how real it feels and looks like.

Despite that, that is not the best thing the film has to offer, as there is one actor above everyone else and that is Robin Williams, who's in the supporting role of the psychiatrist Sean McGuire. Williams is pure excellence, he's just absolute perfection and without a doubt the best thing you see in the entire film. McGuire is also a man with a troubled past, so the characters of Sean McGuire and Will Hunting find something in common, which firstly leads to an odd friendship, but then transforms itself into a true beauty where the word ""friendship"" gets a whole new meaning. The dialog between Williams and Damon is fantastic, being sometimes hilarious yet being smart and clever all of the time. Robin Williams even won an Academy Award from this devotion to the character, IE the best actor in the supporting role, which is a more than a deserved win. Overall I must say that the film shines with magnificent actors in the right roles, so the casting did pretty much a flawless job.

Although ""Good Will Hunting"" is also, as mentioned, hilarious at some points it's also very dramatic, so it slightly mixes up drama with comedy, although maintaining the main perspective in the drama -genre. It's definitely worth a watch after all. Movies like these with this kind of a special flow, which means you don't want it to end but you want it move along as well as it is just so entertaining all the time, don't come out too often. You just can't wait what will happen next. Directing is done by Gus Van Sant, who I think hasn't really done anything that amazing before or after ""Good Will Hunting"". Yes, the directing is great, but you can't really direct a bad movie if the screenplay's this good. Damon and Affleck even won an Academy Award from it, so question is why not write something together in the near future? The Academy Award really speaks for itself, ensuring the fact that writing together again would be a good idea. It would probably be worthwhile.",8
24 April 2020,Incredibly Cheesy,"I Love Robin Williams, and since this is usually regarded as his best performance I thought I would love this movie. It was awful. Williams is good but is given to little screen time, and all he does is talk about his wife. He was much better in Fisher King and Dead Poets Society. All the dialogue and everything that happens in this movie is incredibly unrealistic. Also the characters feel inauthentic.

22 February 1999,Just superb in every sense of the word,"I tell you this. 'Good Will Hunting' will be one of my all time favorites. I enjoy seeing homage to extreme intelligence. The truly gifted are such a rare commodity. And most of them do have problems, such as relating to others. Seeing Will drive off into the sunset to Stanford, California and the one woman in his life who truly is his other half, what a clincher and a perfect ending to a magnificent movie. Love pays off. The only reason for living. And the final restrained rapport between Matt and Robin proves that intimacy need not be sensual. What a movie!!!

16 July 2012,Worthy of its praise...,"Well made with some nice musical numbers thrown into the mix. Nothing particularly different in the cinematography but still well put together. On the performance front, Matt Damon did an excellent job as Will Hunting, as did Robin Williams as Sean Maguire. I also thought Stellan Skarsg√•rd did a very good job as Prof. Gerald Lambeau, also Ben Affleck as Chuckie Sullivan and Minnie Driver as Skylar. Also worthy of note were Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser as Will's friends Morgan O'Mally and Billy McBride.

Although I thought the film was very good and the performances were all excellent I didn't quite get the relationship between Will and Skylar. I didn't feel enough time was spent with them for the relationship to become as strong as it was portrayed. Other than that I was with it one hundred percent; I believed in the characters and I found no problem in following their motivations. There's also some great dialogue that gives this one an edge, I really enjoyed that aspect. Over all, a decent drama with maybe slight problem or two, but still¬Ö RECOMMENDED.

27 November 2014,A prodigy Janitor solves unexpectedly one of Ramanujan math equations. He is then discovered. The kid has problems and in comes a psychiatrist.,"The story has a genius. Two fabulous actors lead the show. Though they are a different sort of genius from the rest, they stand out. One genius (Matt) who is a janitor at a prestigious university shows his identity by solving a fabulous math equation. He is discovered as the new Ramanujan of our time. Though this tale so unlikely to happen stands firmly. The other genius is Of (Robin) who comes in contact with this cocky kid by mistake then for a favor for an old friend. The two really have all of it together. Fight, stare, compete and eventually share. The greatness of this movie is in the bonding of two souls. Then freeing and soaring away into their destinies. Magical flick with deep messages. Perfect watch for humor and inner growth. Almost all the characters have a strong stand, save for the heroin. Their are some immortal scenes in this movie. Don't miss the magic of life. Truly beautiful. Moving and a tale of love.

13 May 2013,immediate classic that propelled Affleck & Damon to stardom,"This is a difficult film to rate as the fact that Affleck and Damon wrote it and it did so well, and the screenplay is so good is distracting. All the performances are good but it is the relationship between Matt Damon's Will and Robin Williams' Psychologist Sean that is the most compelling and the genius of the piece. Will Hunting is a broken yet incredibly intelligent young man who's not had the breaks in life, finds inspiration and meaning in his sessions with a compulsory therapist.

Minnie Driver as the love interest gives one of her best roles but isn't a main character but the catalyst for some of Will's breakthroughs. Affleck as the self-sacrificing best friend plays a typical character for him, and I do wonder how they decided who would play which character given that they chose the best combination; Matt Damon as a boy-next-door genius and brokenness was perfect given that Affleck would have been more striking, pretty-boy privilege, bringing his angry intelligence (see Boiler Room) which wouldn't have been so attracting nor so inducing of empathy. Gus Van Sant's straight almost dull direction - given his spacey trippy and arty direction in other films - is ideal for the story and his choices with the screenplay for the style of the fast-paced dialogue, especially in the Williams/Damon therapy sessions, was superb. Clearly Affleck and Damon have a very clear and insightful knowledge and experience of psychology. However, the rest of the film - which the dialogue/screenplay distracts from - is average, with some special moments, but predictable and a bit Hollywood. It is, however, rightly, an immediate modern classic and Robin Williams and Matt Damon (and Ben Affleck for the writing credit with Damon) rightly were praised to high heaven for their performances. A great film in parts but a good film in general.",7
13 September 2010,Feel the Bliss of a Great Mind,"I believe movies r a way to look thru eyes of people who looked beyond the mundane. Who explored Human feelings, emotions...beyond just love, anger, lust n sadness..Good Will Hunting is one such svelte work of art.

It was not supposed to be about Will Hunting intellect and it is not. It was not supposed to be about telling tale of a great mind and the greatness it accomplished. It was suppose to give u a chance to feel what it feels being 'Will Hunting' and it does that beautifully.

In parts, it shows the struggle that on within the calm demeanor. In others, it shows you how greatness become meaningless when its bestowed upon u. At the same time, it shows the mortality of Will Hunting nature. His craving for acknowledgment. It unfolds, one after the other, the layers of complexity that marks his multi-dimension personality...When he with Ben...when he with Robin and the most beautiful one is when he is with Minnie.

You have to sit and connect yourself with Will Hunting to really takes his place and live a life that comes along once is century.

And as Robin William says in the movie..'But you're a genius Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you' So go...give urself a chance to try and feel the bliss of being Will Hunting...",10
9 May 2020,Amazing - Start to Finish,"Even the storyline is good before watching the film. That shows the potential of this film.

This movie can be raved about so I'll just bring my one opinion, that's a downside, to this review. It's a little dry at times and it's pace is slow, which caused me to lose interest at times.

Humans always remember things for how it made them feel. So, that's my take on that same point with this film.

I will add this though...Robin Williams and Matt Damon: excellent chemistry and acting.

(7/9/20): I watched the film again. My previous review must be changed. What an amazing, compelling, moving story. It displays some of Robin William's, Matt Damon's, and the casts best. It shows the power of empathy, self-reflection, and love.",8

The film follows around a Harvard janitor that breaks the law most often, but has a mind like a mathematician. Weekly, he visits his match, a psychologist who helps him with his life's steps. The film just really focuses on finding his true destiny. It felt like a true-to-life feature about real people. This movie is really enjoying, and it's one of the more finest movies ever made. Written in a powerful script by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who also starred as characters in the movie, and including other members of the cast including Robin Williams and Minnie Driver, the film takes our lives to the next level, and teaches us to find our true destiny and to know who we really are as people. Matt Damon brings the performance of a lifetime as Will Hunting, but it's he and Robin Williams, as Damon's psychologist, that really stand up for this movie. Director Gus Van Sant has provided a heartwarming movie with a beautiful message, and he improves with no doubt. I really enjoyed for its fine writing, brilliant music score, and great characters. The film was an excellent choice to be known as one of the best movies of all time. ""Good Will Hunting"", in my review, ""an inspirational national treasure of a movie.""",10
1 April 2020,Fabulous,"This movie is just fabulous! I am a huge Mat Damon fan and he really shines in this one. The script is excellent and the performances are deeply heartfelt. This is a movie that I watch again and again as it makes me cry. Please Hollywood - make more moves like this!

29 November 2020,"Beautiful, human story, reflection of human complexity","This film about a deeply wounded genius soul is by itself a therapy. To be honest, the first Gus Van Sant directed movie I saw was Even Cowgirls Get the Blues and I didn't get it at all. And looking at its rating, few did. But this one got my heart. Clever, deep, way deeper than it appears at first...

30 October 2005,Now that's what I call acting!,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9
24 April 2001,"Every time I see it, I love it more","I remember watching this when it first came out on video. My uncle said he wasn't sure if I should watch it due to the excessive amount of bad language. But my Mom told him it was alright (my fav. movie is Pulp Fiction, I think I cand handle this). So I watched it and loved it.

A couple months later Blockbuster had it on sale for two dollars, so I bought it. I watched it again and loved it even more than the first time. So it seems everytime I watch it I love it more than the last time.

For one, the acting. Matt Dillon and Ben Affleck were very good and seemed very comfortable with the roles they were in. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, it is always nice to see him doing something heartfelt, showing that he is a true actor, not just a clown. Minnie Driver was very good also. All of the roles seemed well written. The writing of the film is perfection. It allows us tp feel sorry for someone who could seem very unforgiving for all the pain he brings people. Also, it allows us to see both sides of the story. I sympathized with Will, I think if he didn't want to ""Explain things to people my whole life"" then that is what he wants and should be aloud to do what he wants. I also understood where the professor was coming from, he just didn't want to see Will throw his life away.

It is a very good film and I recomend it to all. 9.5/10",
23 October 2008,The Best Movie not in the IMDb Top 250- one of the best ever made,"If you've seen the movie Paycheck, you would not assume that Ben Affleck has brilliant writing talent in him. He apparently does and, along with childhood pal Matt Damon, in Good Will Hunting, he has penned a nearly perfect script. Good Will Hunting will make you laugh and make you cry. It will make you angry and sad and happy and excited all at once. It makes you root for its protagonist one moment and then hate him for being so stubborn the next. In short, it is one of the most powerful screenplays ever written.

Besides the writing, it is also perfectly acted. Ben Affleck is fantastic as Will Hunting's best friend and deserved an Oscar nomination simply for the scene in which he tells Will that he wishes Will would one day simply not be at his house. While Affleck is great in a relatively small role, however, it is Damon and Robin Williams who steal the show as the titular character and his psychologist, respectively. Damon's Will Hunting is just about the smartest man in the world, a man who can solve the most difficult calculus problem in his head and can read a book in a matter of minutes. Despite his genius, he is deeply emotionally troubled, due to his upbringing on the rough streets of Boston. Williams won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the only man who was able to get under Will's skin.

The movie, as stated above, makes you feel a wide span of emotions. Will is such a complex character that we cannot ever fully understand what makes him tick. Sometimes, we feel like he is growing emotionally, and sometimes we just can't grasp why he is being so stubborn and immature. The movie flows beautifully from one scene to the next and only seems to get better as it progresses. Also, it stands up wonderfully upon multiple viewings.

Good Will Hunting was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1997 but only came away with two wins, Robin Williams for Best Supporting Actor and Damon and Affleck for Best Original Screenplay. I have seen all five films nominated for Best Picture that year, and this film is far and away the best of them. Titanic is a very good movie and certainly groundbreaking in terms of visual effects, but it comes nowhere close to making the emotional impact that this film makes. Also, Matt Damon was absolutely robbed of an Oscar for Best Actor by Jack Nicholson (As Good as it Gets).

Simply put, Good Will Hunting is one of the best films of the 1990's and one of my personal favorites of all time. I have handed out only 20 ratings of perfect 10's on IMDb out of over 600 films that I've rated. Good Will Hunting earned this coveted rating by combining a phenomenal screenplay with superb direction and impeccable acting. This film is truly one not to miss.",10
23 March 2001,Definitely in my top 5 all time,"Good Will Hunting, is a damn good movie. I cannot believe that ben affleck and matt damon wrote this wonderful script. It has some of the best written scenes i have ever seen. Both damon and affleck are excellent in the movie and the supporting cast led by williams is awesome. this was one that i instantly fell in love with and it should be a piece of everyones home video or dvd collection.

21 February 2003,What do geniuses say?,"Good story, excellent acting - especially by Matt Damon, really outdistancing all the others - and an awakener of many thoughts. Just one thing: what do geniuses say, really?

A script writer might need to be one, too, to get it right. This film leans heavily on learning, instead of wisdom, on wits instead of brilliance, on truisms instead of innovative perspectives. The actors do a great job in hiding this flaw, but there it is.

The nature of the genius has been explored since the romanticism of the early 19th century - I'm not sure the idea of such blessed humans was even around, before that. Maybe such people exist, and maybe not. In most cases, they have very specialized talents. Some have perfect memory, others excel at math. That does in no way make them better equipped for rhetoric or social skills. Thus, a genius can be a real idiot, outside that special field of competence.

Let's say that two brilliant persons sit down and have a very enlightened conversation with each other. What do they say? How much do they have to say? And will we, the audience, at all understand? Afore such uncertainties, succumbing to a love story finale seems to be the safe way out. But that's no stroke of genius.",7
3 August 2002,Goody goody will be pretentious !,"My brother rented this movie and told me to also check it out and after watching it, I had a bad aftertaste in my mouth.

I felt that the plot is unbelievable, pretentious and the characters are, pheyew ! too goody, goody two shoes ! (apart from the constant bad language)

This is just another ""feel-good-movie"" trying to take people on a emotional ride which, after watching it, makes one doesn't feel anything but that the plot is trying hard to shove the emotional thing down one's throat.

The screenwriters have forgot to add some sincerity into the show and puhleez! People can smell if the movie is sincere or just patronizing. Just take Dead Poets Society, I have seen the show years, years back and can still remember the story and some scenes from the show as it is memorable and I do care about the characters and how they feel.

26 November 1999,Such Language!,"Although the storyline was good, the terrible language was really a turn-off and ruined the movie for me. I don't feel that I am a prude, but I don't know anyone who talks like that and the movie would have been so much better without it.

15 November 2016,Genuine,"Knowing Damon mostly from his tough guy roles like The Departed, and The Bourne Series, I was surprised by his acting in Good Will Hunting, especially because he was so young then. But taking a look at the list of movies he has done now, I have to admit that he is one hell of an actor. He has done so many different roles - which shows his capability and proves his talent. Affleck doesn't have much screen-time in this, but plays his character well enough, as did his brother Casey Affleck, and Hauser. Williams will be missed for making these tear jerking moments, as he is able to portray empathetic characters so well.

The film felt very genuine, mostly because it was unfiltered, and dealt with emotions from the perspectives of different people. Damon and Affleck really did quite a good job with writing the narrative, and Gus Van Sant in directing it. However, there are certain scenes where the monologues are just too long. For example, Sean had one when he and Will were sitting on a park bench after their first meeting. He just went on and on, and the close-ups too are a little unnerving. Then there was another monologue by Will while he was sitting in Sean's office, and kind of went off on a tangent to the point where I realized I had lost track of what he was saying.

Also, I could have done without the slow-motion fighting scenes. Whenever there was a cut, you could tell it is obviously choreographed, and that they were moving in slow-motion themselves. That along with the frequent close-ups took me out of the narrative.

Overall, a great watch with a complicated protagonist who has many levels to him. The cast is great, and the cinematography, for the most part, intriguing. The language may be hard to understand though, and the vulgarity is certainly off-putting, but adds to the characters.

6 September 2019,Before Watching: Good Will Hunting (1997),"""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) is an intriguing drama about guilt, life, and love. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:

This is a movie that revolves a lot around feelings. The protagonist has very complex emotions that has expressed him downward into a negative spiral, and subsequently, the progress and resolution can be very emotionally intense on both sides of the spectrum. Matt Damon's and Robin William's both deliver good performances that makes their shared screen-time both thoughtful and enjoyable.

There are, nevertheless, sides to this that has the potential to subtract from this viewing experience. There is a lot of cursing present as well as crude language, and a lot of sexual references and jokes that can offend sensitive viewers. There is also mentioning of abuse from parents, which can be another sensitive subject for some. Depending on one's attitude toward these flipsides, the movie will come across as either wonderful or a waste of potential - or as a compromise in between.

My personal grade: an annoying 4/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",4
17 August 2023,Cinema Personified: Incredible Movie,"REDUX (08/15/2023) Rating: 9.6 Overall, the best-written movie I have ever seen as this iconic film stands the test of time to show how EQ is just as important as IQ as we go on a journey through Will Hunting's journey, driven by great direction and performances along with its superb writing.

Great Direction (Nothing is above and beyond but he does a great job in moving the story forward (uses the writing to mostly tell the story) as he uses a decently lighthearted storytelling style to help you care about the characters; gets a lot out of the actors in the interpersonal scenes as the conversations they have really make the movie captivating), Great Acting (Incredible from Robin Williams (The best performance of the movie as he uses both his dramatic and comedic abilities to create a very well-rounded character that acts as the father-figure Will never had), Incredible from Matt Damon (The most dynamic character of the movie as he drives the story forward with his charm and line delivery (mainly because wrote the script)), Very Good from Ben Affleck (Plays the complement to Damon very well as their chemistry makes their on-screen relationship very believable), Very Good from Stellan Skarsg√•rd (Works well in his scenes with Williams and Damon as it is very obvious to see when his ego is checked and how much change he has throughout the movie), Good to Very Good from Minnie Driver (Plays the female lead well (but feels like kinda out of place given who the rest of the cast is)), Very Good from the rest of the cast (All play their part well as it helps with setting the tone and the place of Boston (especially Southie))), Brilliant Story (A very iconic story that is laid out brilliantly as the directing, performances, and dialogue drive this story forward into being one of the best ever told on the big screen; the story elements build off of each other as each part has its purpose as the ending shows what it was building to the entire time; the character development is great as well as the movie is really about that and it delivers (for more than just one)), Brilliant Screenplay (The best screenplay I have ever seen as the dialogue is so tight/sharp as it is filled with many callbacks and allusions to help drive the story and the message forward; the wit and humor make this movie as it gives it that working-class edge that sets Will and his gang apart from the establishment characters; the symbolism is great as it really helps with showing the message of the movie (Will's genius vs his development); the foreshadowing is prominent as it shows at what they were trying to build the entire time), Very Good Score (Pretty safe overall but complements the emotions of the scenes very well), Good Cinematography (Good for a low-budget movie), Pretty Good Sound, Very Good Editing (Especially for how low-budget the movie is, helps with driving the story forward), Plot Structure was laid out incredibly well as the different narrative elements are shown and each individual story element helps with move the movie forward (with the climax and resolution helping with showing the message), Pacing was a bit on the slower side (though this was not a terrible issue) as it felt like this movie wanted to use as much time as it could to have scenes that show off the characters and their personalities; Runtime should be kept the same as there really is no scene I would want to cut, Climax was executed very well and helps with showing how far Will has come on his journey (and finding out what he wants to do with his life), Tone was very feel-good as this light-hearted tone helps with making the audience love the characters more and making the drama overall feel very fun

ORIGINAL (06/13/2017) Rating: 9.6 Great Acting by top 2 1/2, Brilliant Screenplay, Great Story, Score complements the emotions of the scenes, Great Character development.",10
3 December 2021,Respectable but overly sentimental,"Strong, naturalistic performances and the story is solid. It also evokes a strong sense of location and community, obviously close to the writers heart. That said, I don't find I connect with this film; it's just a bit too jam packed with shmaltz for my taste. I can definitely see why it's well regarded though.

30 September 2004,Don't forget the value of a great public library system !,"It's hard to believe that in a single year so many outstanding and unforgettable films hit the box office, but 1997 was indeed such a year. In any other this film would have walked away with Oscars for ''Best Director'' and ''Best Picture'', but suffice it say I'm grateful that the team of B. Affleck & M. Damon won for their outstanding screenplay. Damon's ''Best Actor'' nod was also well deserved and the two partners worked in tandem to play up Damon while playing down an equally strong B. Affleck (the latter shows his outstanding potential in ''Armageddon''). Most difficult this must have been, for otherwise the characters of Robin Williams and Minnie Farmer, both of whom got Oscar nods and the former who finally took home a statue, would have been lost in the shuffle. This film and its story were pure talent from start to finish, totally original and a refreshing change. Underdog over spoiled yuppie -- that's my kind of film -- and one's got to be happy for Williams who finally bagged an Oscar. Top rating (5 stars of 5) !

9 December 2003,"Hell, it was a good movie.","While plot wise it wasn't really that innovative, it more than made up for it in the dialogue. I still refuse to believe those f***ers Damen and Afleck wrote it themselves but until its proven false, I will give credit where it is deserved. The dialogue was riveting, it really was. Gus Van Sant also did a good job adding feeling and color where dialogue was absent. Hell, even the score chosen was appropriate for the scenes they portrayed. Williams did a tremendous outshine everyone job acting, and even Afleck and Damen were far from shabby. And as much as we all like to hate Driver, she too was ok I guess. The movie from start to finish was told smoothly and was crafted deliberately. Still, it was those small tidbits of dialogue that made the movie incredible and unique. Few can deny the power of the script.

12 April 2012,"""Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them""","Will Hunting, a janitor at MIT, has a gift for mathematics but needs help from a psychologist to find direction in his life.

I've seen the film back when I was about 10. I really didn't understand much of what was going on, and declared it was boring. Now today I decided to watch the film, forgetting that I was just a little kid, and was fully prepared to absorb myself into mature emotions that I never understood back then... And surprisingly, I was in for an experience, because Good Will Hunting is like a more understanding version of Shawshank Redemption. While that movie can be good in it's own ways, this one contains realism alongside the emotions, which is better already. So the acting, as you can already tell, is going to be brilliant. Robin Williams (if he's not playing in a children's film) gives the film it's best, and does it best. I love Matt Damon as well, and he basically carried the film with Williams. The supporting cast was great as well. Everything else was great too, but instead of praising the film we already know is GOOD, I want to point out my annoyances that brought down the score. The film tends to get a little corny. Now don't get me wrong, the film is well-acted, but some scenes totally trashed this idea. I'm talking about Matt Damon's rants about the law, or Ben Affleck's attempt to act cool. Although they didn't ruin the film, they annoyed me. But avoiding these annoyances, I found the movie brilliant. The story was a moving experience, and if the acting wasn't there, I think the movie would still be good. The soundtrack was also great as well, and it fit the film in a strange way... So without blabbering on about how good the film is, I'm going to rate it an 8/10...

Should you should it? If you can get past the slow-burn pacing and the little things that annoy you, you will be pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Robin Williams is pure brilliance, and the film carries it's messages throughout brilliantly. The movie is pure brilliance. 8/10.",8
31 October 1999,Big Deal,"Often, when a Robin Williams character is the most palatable feature of a film, the film may be avoided and the filmgoer's admission may be saved and the filmgoer may enjoy $7.00 worth of candy and cake (There are exceptions - ""Dead Poets'"" is one, of course). Good Will Hunting doubtlessly sold lots of issues of Teen People magazine - but it also kept a lot of good filmgoers from enjoying a lot of good candy and cake.

-That's what I think.

16 April 2009,"Worth watching, even if you have to put it on layaway!","One might think of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as one-hit-wonders after watching their one and only writing credit come to life in the magnificent ""Good Will Hunting."" In the wake of its success, both went on to become quite prominent in Hollywood, but only for their acting abilities, leading some to question if they really wrote it themselves or not. But surely, if someone (whether it be William Goldman or Kevin Smith) served as a ghostwriter, they wouldn't have been able to keep their mouths shut all this time. We are speaking of an Oscar winning movie here, afterall. No, the two men (especially Damon) deserve all the credit in the world and it's a shame that they haven't written another movie since, because ""Good Will Hunting"" has enough soul to eclipse any big-budget block-buster they may have done after the fact.

Meet Will Hunting. Will has had a tough childhood. Because of this, he chooses to stick close to his three buddies, drinking and laughing it up, cleaning up the halls of a prestigious college, ignoring his true calling. His gift, it turns out, is that he's more than just a brilliant mathematician ‚Äì he's a bonafide genius! When a professor catches him at the blackboard solving a problem no one else can, he insists on helping him. In an attempt to break through his tough shell and promote his talent, a therapist (Robin Williams) is brought in and the two find out they are more similar than they care to admit, as Will comes face to face with his brutal past in an attempt to better his future. Ben Affleck stars as his best friend Chuckie. Chuckie has perhaps one of the finest moments towards the end of the film, in a speech where he tells Will that leaving town without saying goodbye would be the best repayment he could ever give his friends. This is without a doubt one of the most moving moments of the film, and surely, one of Affleck's finest roles. As close friends, Damon and Affleck have chemistry that glows in the film; in fact, they seem like brothers from birth. Robin Williams plays the catalyst and almost-father-figure in Will's life, and turns in another fine performance in a serious role. Some improvised bits help keep things feeling natural and he brings the charm in full force, so much so that it's become a clich√© for him.

""Good Will Hunting"" is that rare kind of inspirational film that may actually inspire some. While Will's story may not be the story of Matt Damon's life, it certainly feels real and hits close to home with anyone who doesn't believe in themselves enough. Directed by Gus Van Sant, it's got little style, instead, focusing tightly on its characters, showing them in their most vulnerable moments. The script, afterall, is the star of the film. What you take away from this film will be its message and its humanity; the fact that it stars Robin Williams in a script written by two Hollywood heroes will only be an afterthought. I tried to find a flaw in it all, and alas, there is none. If anything, the story is a little too predictable -- right up to the telegraphed ending -- but that would be side-stepping the whole purpose of the story. If it takes a little clich√© and predictability to drive home such a powerful story, than so be it. The true meaning of ""Good Will Hunting"" is invincible in that respect.",10

8 February 2008,An underrated film that may be rendered 'classic' by the passage of time.,"It has taken me several years and many viewings of this film to finally be able to give it the review that I think it deserves, from my point of view. And the very fact this has been a laboured decision has probably been a good thing. Very few of my favourite films have been ones that I can sit down and review right away. They're usually so profound I have to experience them at different points in my life and at every turn, be amazed and vindicated by them.

Good Will Hunting is no different.

I want to start with my favourite aspect of the picture: the script. The script is by my definition completely sublime. It moves seamlessly from group dialogue, to one-on-one revelatory back and forth dialogue, to some of the all time best monologues I've ever heard. The monologue, so long associated with the diatribe of a supervillian in action films, is given new meaning here. The script manages to touch upon the many facets of human existence and reaction without sounding contrived or clich√©d. If Damon and Affleck never write another script, never mind. This is one that defies all expectation. There is strong, believable character development throughout. At the moment I empathise with Will; young, ambitious, cocky and uncertain. I expect as I grow older, I will tend to empathise more with Shaun; experienced, intellectual and with an enduring 'down but not out' attitude.

This magnificent script is backed up by career defining performances. Matt Damon does a great job of the intelligent yet lost genius Will Hunting. We see that behind a defensive facade there is a fragile, talented individual making tentative steps into a potentially difficult adulthood. Ben Affleck is so good here as Will's best friend that I find it hard to believe he hasn't done anything as poignant since. As a blue-collar man with a simple philosophy (and one of the best monologues in the film, no less) he really defines and exceeds his archetype. Minnie Driver also performs wonderfully in an underrated role as Skylar - as with Affleck she is on such form that I can't believe she has not yet matched this performance. The real star turn here is of course Robin Williams, on startling form as a grieving psychologist. It's hard to describe how pivotal his role without giving away plot points. It suffices to say, it's an excellent study into character dimension.

With the script and performances discussed, it must also be said that the cinematography matches the intent of both perfectly. There is a nice mix of both shallow and deep focus shots, interesting and not overstated use of colour when contrasting both in and outdoor scenes and many other pleasing touches a more astute eye than mine will be able to identify. The film is also underpinned by a moving never obtrusive soundtrack; I was delighted to hear Elliott Smith featuring no less than three times.

To summarise without drifting into unending hyperbole, yes this film require some suspension of disbelief. If you are particularly gifted in the field that Will is purported to be a genius in, you may have a hard time. Even I identified some of the problems he faces as simplistic. I believe this course of action is taken to prevent alienation of the audience - a complex discussion of the intricacies of advanced mathematics would stiffen the pace and be besides the point. The film is about the journey of the protagonist; how a precarious genius might perceive the world around him or her in such a different way as to make social interaction difficult. It paints such a great picture that I feel that here is an underrated film that should be rendered 'classic' by the passage of time.

Here's hoping! 9/10",9
18 March 1999,Excellent,"""Good Will Hunting"" is not one of those conventional Hollywood dramas that are filled with sentimental moments, melodramatic situations and stereotypical characters. It is a film that focuses on realistic characters, their complex lives and the things life has to give them, whether they want them or not. Something every human being can relate too. ""Good Will Hunting"" is a genuinely good film, that has qualities I consider a rarity these days in movies. This may sound over the top, but this movie will most likely be one of the most memorable dramas of the 90`s. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck`s honest and invigorating script transfers almost perfectly onto the big screen, with the help of director Gus Van Sant. ""Good Will Hunting"" is about a young, cocky but deeply troubled young man named Will Hunting. He lives in South Boston with his street bum friends, but there`s something that separates him from the rest; He`s a genius. After an MIT professor accidentally discovers his gift, Will`s life starts to change, more dramatically than he thinks. Two strangers almost simultaneously then enter Will`s life; Sean Maguire, a widowed psychologist who tries to help Will, played greatly by Robin Williams. And Skylar (played equally as good by Minnie Driver), a vibrant Harvard student who quickly falls in love with Will. Will`s relationship with both them and his blue-collar friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), all seem to deeply affect him, making it more difficult for Will to realise what he truly needs. The ending of the film sort of leaves you hanging, but you will no doubt me moved. ""Good Will Hunting"" is pretty down-to-earth film, but it is enriched with an indescribable power that is probably generated by all the exceptional performances, the script and Gus Van Sant`s unparalleled direction. A satisfying, powerful and thought-provoking movie.",9
9 August 2008,Better every time,"I'm not sure why I like ""Good Will Hunting"" so much. The plot is such a simple story of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a young man with intelligence way beyond his years, yet all he is choosing to do with his life is cleaning the floors at his job and hanging out with his friends. After getting in trouble with the law, college professor Sean Maquire (Robin Williams, in his Oscar-winning role) is the only person willing to counsel him and turn his life around. Maybe I enjoy this film because I relate so well to it, as I am a college student unsure of what to do with my life. The film has rightly been described as a ""slow-burner,"" and I would agree. It was during my second viewing that the film's greatness suddenly hit me, and I really began to like it. It entertains but also brings tears to my eyes. It has the same inspirational value as Robin Williams' earlier film ""Dead Poets Society,"" for which he also should have won an Academy Award. Although I prefer this film, since it focuses more on inspiring a single person rather than an entire group, both movies are excellent. Maybe it's not an entirely perfect film, but watch this one (more than once if necessary) and be prepared to be moved.

1 April 2015,Robin Williams - well done,"This movie is genius. When robin williams passed away i honestly thought he was an overrated actor and considering his repertoire of ""RV"" and stupid movies like that one, I just didn't have too much respect for robin williams. but after watching this movie i felt dumbfounded to even minorly think that. robin williams' character gives me goosebumps when he talks. and that doesn't mean he has cheezy lines, its because it just felt like the words coming out of his mouth were real. that he wasn't given a script. he was having a normal conversation

Anyways... thats my favourite part of the movie. but its not the only part. this movie is always interesting. it feels like there is not one point in the movie in which i could go to the bathroom and feel like i missed nothing. and the casting for the main roles is perfect.

27 February 2008,I'm pumped! Let the healing begin!,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",8
2 December 2004,To all the morons who didn't like this movie,"I've read several complaints by people who didn't like this movie, and they all say the same thing (i.e. no one can be that smart, how did Will have time to read all those books?, even geniuses have to get some formal education, how was he an expert on everything?, etc. etc. etc.).

Newsflash folks: Will was a genius of unusual magnitude. Yes, it's extremely unlikely for someone to be that smart, but it's possible. So stop complaining about the basic premise of the movie and just accept it.

And what a dumb thing to complain about. That's like me saying that Ghostbusters is a dumb movie because ghosts don't really exist and you can't catch them with special guns. It's fiction folks. Just accept it and enjoy the movie.

1 April 2010,Those psychological sessions are gripping.,"Good Will Hunting brings us a movie that has a compelling and gripping drama.The psychological sessions that Robin Williams take are a revelation in the movie.Robin Williams has given one of his best performances after Awakenings i guess.Robin Williams as a psychologist of Will(Matt Demon) changes the life of his student giving the right tutelage and winning faith over him.Matt Demon does a commendable role as Will,who wants nothing from his life.Ben Affleck is a tremendous support.Stellan Skarsg√•rd has done a fine job as the professor.The movie portrays that a rare talent should never be wasted.The ending is quite good and the letter in the last scene read by Robin Williams is tremendous.Its all about priority for Will.So will he go for the women he loves or will he be happy with a great job related to Mathematics?You have to watch this to find out.Not the perfect film but those scenes of psychology sessions with Robin Williams,are a sight to see.

14 December 2001,"Way too many ""F"" words....","It's hard to believe that screenwriters can't create intelligent dialog between characters without having to use the F word 100's of times. (If you think I'm kidding, then pop in the movie and start counting)

It took me two nights to wade through this movie's dialog. I did enjoy Robin William's character interaction with Will... but had I watched the ""edited for TV"" version I would probably be writing a much nicer review.

A good story... but it's impact is heavily damaged with the extreme profanity.

I'll take ""Finding Forrester"" over this one.

25 November 2002,Would have liked it better if it had been hyped less,"I finally got around to seeing this film and frankly, with all the hype that surrounded it when it was new, I had expected something better. It's interesting that it's a film written by two childhood friends and that they made it big. It's less interesting as a film, period. Don't get me wrong; it's not really a BAD movie, it's just an average movie with nothing terribly surprising, innovative, or new, and it had a big reputation to live up to.

The concept of a genius in janitors' clothing was new to me, and while it's refreshing to see a topic in a movie that hasn't been in a hundred movies before, the way the rest of the story played out was somewhat predictable. Didn't mean I didn't like it, just that I wasn't surprised by it. I was expecting something a bit more surprising or shocking, and frankly the only thing shocking about this movie was the language. Couldn't it have been made without quite so much profanity?

Some of the lines were quite a pleasure to watch -- especially Will's brainy monologues. And the acting was all around quite good, especially by Minnie Driver and the two leading male characters (Matt Damon's Will and Ben Affleck's character). Overall this isn't going to be one of my favorites, but I'm not sorry I watched it.",6
26 March 2023,A Slice of Life Picture Unlike Any Other!!,"Good Will Hunting is a slice of life picture unlike any other, the film that put Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on the American Entertainment charts forever, and arguably was comic legend Robin Williams greatest work of all-time!! Those factors all stirred into one make Good Will Hunting an American classic, and easily one of the greatest films of all-time!! Unlike most great films that cover great people that do great things, Good Will Hunting turns the table upside down and chronicles the life of Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a boy genius that gets bounced from foster home to foster home in his youth and was never seen as a true genius by the system outside of protecting himself when it came down to the court system. Lucky for Will he does have his friends though, led by Chuckie (Ben Affleck) who supports him throughout the film and finally near the end of the film challenges Will to do better in life because he and the rest of his crew know how much smarter Will is than the rest of his group. It's interesting to note that the Will character, acting wise, came down to a coin flip between Damon and Affleck. If Damon didn't win the coin flip we would have seen Affleck in the role of the troubled genius janitor. Makes you think, doesn't it? Besides Will's crew there's a love story in the movie as Will eventually chases after a Harvard student he picks up in a way at a bar named Skylar played well by English actress Minnie Driver. Robin Williams' performance is something to talk about as well. Winner of the Academy Award in Best Supporting Actor that year for this role, Williams cuts right to the heart as Will's therapist as he can really identify with the troubled youth. The two share life and laughs, and Williams puts forward a very strong performance!! Stellan Skarsgard also puts forward a very good performance in the movie as well. Great acting, a good sound track, outstanding writing that won the duo of Damon and Affleck the Academy Award for Original Screenplay that year, make this a movie not to miss!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",8
13 April 2009,"""Just playing""... with a little help from his friends","Ultimately, Will winds up doing his mandatory psychotherapy with a college-days friend of Lambeau's, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Maguire is a Southie himself. The essence of the remainder of GWH is the question of the nature of Will's inner demons and whether he will conquer them with the help of Dr. Maguire, through his relationship with his homey friends, and/or through his newfound love, Skylar (Minnie Driver). If I have any contrary comments about the movie it's that the relationship between Will and Skylar is drawn too quickly; she comes to see something deeply lovable in him in the span of a few weeks.

And that perception of hers contrasts with the early period of Hunting's therapy with Sean, in which we see him exhibiting a harsh judgmentalism of everyone‚Äîall of whom are his intellectual inferiors. We wonder if that harshness will affect his growing affection for Skylar.

30 December 1998,THE BEST MOVIE........I LOVED IT,"What do I have to say about Good Will Hunting?? That I absolutely loved it! I find no flaws in this film! I was disappointed it didn't get best picture instead of Titanic! First of all, the script......it blew me away. The emotions that each character displayed was perfect....not one scene was boring or stupid, or unnecessary. Matt Damon was pretty much perfect (I loved him in the scene where him and Minnie Driver get into the huge argument), and my heart went out to Robin Williams unforgettable character (remember the park scene? It doesn't get much better than that!). Ben Affleck was also a bright point, his performance was great (I actually thought he deserved a nomination as well for his acting, but what can ya do?) And though people thought Minnie Driver was overrated, I loved her character and she fully deserved her nomination. The only minor problem was there was a little too much swearing, but it kind of suited the film. This is now at the top of my list of favourite movies. This movie is one of those ones you can watch over and over and it will never fail to amaze you.

19 July 2023,A soulful masterpiece,"Good Will Hunting is all about self-discovery, and it packs a powerful message about compassion and finding your true self. The characters are real, relatable, and will stay with you for ages.

I gotta be real, though. If you're looking for non-stop action or crazy twists, this might not be your jam. It's more about the characters and their emotional journey, so it takes its time. But trust me, it's worth every minute.

The acting is off the charts! Matt Damon nails it as Will Hunting, showing his intelligence, pain, and even humor with pure authenticity. And Robin Williams as the therapist, Sean Maguire, is like the perfect balance to Will. Williams brings the feels, man, and you'll be reaching for the tissues. A well-deserved Oscar for him.

26 December 1999,...just to see Robin Williams,"How good can Robin Williams be in a serious role? Just terrific, like Dead Poets Society. This movie is worth seeing, if only for his great park-scene monologue. Notice the interesting camera technique where the camera stays trained on Williams the entire time. The camera wouldn't have moved even if ordered by Van Sant himself. The screen play has an unbelievable premise; but so well written, who cares.

21 September 2010,"Cast, script, direction, and emotion is all A+ stuff","This movie is very special. It features very surprising acting, a great script, and much more. Everyone in the cast does an good job, but the two that stand out are Matt Damon and Robin Williams. They are both phenomenal. Matt does a great job in his role as a punk who doesn't know how to escape his punk lifestyle (also doesn't even know if he wants to) despite being a genius. He plays being a genius very well. When he is given the big scientific words to say very quickly he does it like a real genius would. Then there is Robin Williams giving a wonderful performance. With most of the movies you have probably seen him in sucking you'll be surprised by how much of a good job he does here. Then there is the very good script to back this movie up. Ben and Matt will surprise you with how good their writing is. Also if you know Affleck for his work in stuff like ""Gigli"" trust me when I say that he can be a great writer and actor if he gets it right. Also the camera-work here is excellent. Overall this movie I highly recommend for it's strong story and cast.

30 August 1999,Well acted,"An interesting story line about a young man with violent tendancies that is a genius at solving mathematical proofs and anything else he cares to lend a hand at. The genius (Will Hunting) is played by Matt Damon, who is a newcomer to me and I must say he has a strong screen presence - his acting was first class. Robin Williams plays the psychiatrist that tries to get to the bottom of Will's problems. Will is so intelligent that in the discussions with the psychiatrist it is more often the psychiatrist's life that is put in question. Although I enjoyed the film, it was slow at times and the ending, although emotional, was a little understated. Fine acting makes this film worth watching but be warned there are a lot of 4-letter words.

15 May 2014,Healthy Cynicism,"This movie makes a strong statement for individuality and stepping outside of the system. The brilliance of Damon's character (Will Hunting), lies not in his mathematical genius, but in his ability to assess social structures, schemes and systems. His cynicism is an effective shield against those who would use his talents for their own personal gain. Robin Williams' character is very believable as a therapist, because while he does not necessarily support Hunting becoming part of the corporate (or government) money machine, he does express the value in using one's abilities to one's utmost.

the movie could have benefited from an exploration of Hunting's past (where he came from and what made him what he is), as well as some time spent in understanding what his inner thoughts and feelings are. Maybe the scene with Ben Affleck acting as Hunting's agent could have been scrapped, to fit in more character development for Hunting. Again, this movie makes an important statement about how the amoral, cookie-cutter world of business has affected us all and therefore, why some revile and avoid it.

This is a warning to the society we have built: Integrate those who are dis-affected, and create a world of greater humanity or we will all suffer the loss of ourselves.",7

14 March 2007,Overuse of F-Word Kills A Good Film,"There are some excellent moments in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon, the genius, conceited, janitor working nights at MIT, doing the bars, and eying the women with his (real life) buddy and best friend Ben Affleck along with the Psychiatrist, Robin Williams, who tries to keep Damon out of jail and on the straight and narrow path.

It's a very good coming of age character study, mixed in with some powerful scenic changes and moods. Director Gus Van Sant creates a genuine feeling for the characters and their situations so that you can (almost) feel empathy for Will Hunting and his troubled past. BUT...

The film's tender moments are ruined to the point of destruction with the F-bomb coming out of Damon's mouth at every other breath. This approach seems to be more for shock value, and it is overdone so much that friends of mine who had seen this movie thought it was overkill as well. A couple of relatives walked out of the theater because the language became so bad it was like, ""OK, when is it going to stop?"" The movie becomes a chore, a task to sit through when it shouldn't be because of the non-stop profanity. Many will think Damon doesn't need therapeutic guidance, but his mouth washed out with soap instead.

This is a movie where I actually like the censored TV print better! Without the F-bombs, the story is so much better and delivers a richer meaning than leaving them in.

The bad language really hurts what could have been a GREAT movie.",7
9 October 2021,A Review: Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Sant,"The Plot

1997s Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Saint is an American drama story that follows a troubled unrecognized genius Will Hunting (Matt Damon) who works as a janitor at MIT. Will is ready to spend his days working a minimal wage job and drinking with his buddies on the weekend until he solves a complex math problem and gets the attention of Prof. Gerald Lambeau who decides to help Will achieve his full potential by solving math problems and getting his life back on track with the help of Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Dr. Maguire acts as a therapist to Will, delving into his deepest fears and worries whilst confronting his own underlying issues in the process.

Review

At first glance, Good Will Hunting seems like a very generic drama with a quite predictable plot, and it is, there is the unrealistically smart genius to whom we could never relate, who despite being so gifted, needs someone else to help him reach his potential. But what really sets this movie apart, is not the plot or crazy unpredictable characters, but the truly realistic and hard-hitting emotions this movie is able to recreate in the viewer's mind. All the characters undergo their own development arch instead of funneling all their screentime into developing only the protagonist, which makes the movie feel way less constricted. You can see the effect of one person directly and significantly impacting another, just like it would in the real world, and most of the time you can really relate and feel those emotions. But the moments where this movie truly shines are the therapy sessions between Will Hunting and Dr. Sean Maguire. They delve deep into the human psyche and emotions, not being afraid of confronting themselves and the viewer with some harsh truths. You can feel the connection they make during the runtime of the film, and Sean becomes almost a guiding father figure to Will. Of course, the character interactions are not the only strong suit of the film. The acting was truly superb, making you believe everything the characters are saying without a doubt. The synergy between Matt Damon and Robin Williams was immaculate.

Conclusion and final thoughts

Overall Good Will Hunting is one incredible movie, achieving such emotional realism that is hard to find these days with all the mainstream blockbusters. It is not afraid to present the rather cruel reality of life, while still showing how to create truly meaningful connections and make you relate to almost all the characters in some way or another. I think this movie is a must-watch for any teenager/young adult.",9

29 July 1998,The Best Movie of 1997,"The premise of Good Will Hunting is one that has been played out in hundreds of other movies. This movie, however, exceeds all of those other movies with it's brilliant screenplay and fantastic acting. Matt Damon delivers a masterful performance as Will Hunting. He, along with Ben Affleck deservedly won the Academy Award for Original Screenplay. Robin Williams and Minnie Driver shine in their supporting roles as Will's psychiatrist and girlfriend. Good Will Hunting may be just another formulaic movie from Hollywood, but, it is done so well that you just don't care. It is a movie that brings a welcomed smile to your face.

17 May 1999,Great film. It has a great story and is inspiring.,"This film follows the life of a young man named Will Hunting(play by Matt Damon)from South Boston who is a genius but has no interest in succeeding in life. He mostly spends his days days hangin' out with his lifelong friend Chuckie(Ben Affleck.)A math teacher puts an incredibly hard math problem out in the hall, and while Will is buffing the floors, he solves it. Will then gets sent to jail because of assaulting a police officer. The math teacher, named Gerald Lambeau, convinces the judge to let him out on two conditions. One, he must report to Gerald every week to work on more advanced mathematical proofs, and two Will must meet with a psychiatrist every week named Sean Macguire(Robin Williams)as well. Will meets a girl named Skylar and soon form a relationship. With Gerald, Sean, and Skylar Will might learn to believe in himself. This film is a must-see for everyone.

23 April 2002,An Important Movie For Me Personally,"My opinion of this movie will never be objective, and I suppose that's a fact I'll simply have to deal with when addressing its detractors. The fact is, for me, this movie came along at a time when I really needed a movie to help me center myself. I was struggling in school and fighting depression when this movie came out, and, after I saw this film, I felt like I would be able to cope with my life more. The fact is, the movie simply spoke to where I was in my life. I was letting people down, struggling and failing to meet the expectations of others and expecting constant failure, setting my personal goals in life lower than they should have been, letting my cynicism and self-hatred get in the way of pursuing my goals.

I just loved everything about this movie from the clever dialogue to the interesting compilation soundtrack between Elliot Smith and Danny Elfman. The acting was top notch feeling real and unstaged, thanks in no small part to the fact that Affleck and Damon didn't hold back with the dialogue choosing a real conversational manner over moviespeak. Though I am nowhere as smart as Will, I can appreciate his struggle with his own feelings of self-doubt and Matt Damon managed to get those feelings across without overplaying his hand. I suppose more than anything else, this movie convinced me to try again, and for that I will always be grateful. It helped me get where I got today through its hopeful, yet true message.

1 January 1999,the wrong recognition,"This movie won a Best Screenplay Oscar. No! This movie had its good points - the acting was incredible, and all of the characters were played believably. But the writing was awful. Robin Williams' character was so pathetically cliched that I personally wanted Will to go psycho and kill him, just so I wouldn't have to watch anymore. And Skylar was no catch, but Will never EVER deserved her. I mean, our first view of this guy has him assaulting a man who never did anything to him. We're supposed to like THIS character? No, mathematical ability is no excuse for this guy's anti-social danger. I fervently believed that Matt Damon was this character, but that doesn't mean it was well written.

7 June 2021,"8.6/10 - A Heartfelt, Brilliantly Written Film","Let's get right into it, folks. This movie is great.

Good Will Hunting follows Will (Matt Damon), a genius janitor who works in a big university. One day he accidently exposes himself, as he solves an equation that most no student could effortlessly and one of the proffesors noticed it. A short while after he gets into jail, and he's allowed to get out only under the supervision of the proffessor, and only if he sees a psychiatrist every week. I won't elaborate further cause we're getting into spoilers here, but that's the summart, basically.

Now, this film is not something that will blow your mind with incredible plot twists, brilliant editing, amazing soundtrack. But even so, it is great for two main reasons - the script and the acting.

I'll say it right now - the script is perfect. Each line flows so well into the plot, each dialogue is strong and well written. It's truly a work of genius in my opinion, and is one of the best, simply amazing scripts I've seen in a film.

The acting is so on-point as well - from Matt Damon to Robin Williams, each actor brings their heart into their character and it shows. The characters and the relationships between them gave me such a real, honest feeling. I liked that a lot.

The plot itslef is great as well, and I like the way that it unpacks and unravels the mind of Will, scene by scene. He's such a fascinating character, and the analogies to other characters are very interesting as well. I like the soundtrack, too - a lot of Elliott Smith...maybe I really should get into his music.

I've heard someone says that the directing is awful here, and I kinda disagree, though I do think that some shots are taken from an awkward angle and stuff like that. Yet, nothing horrible in my opinion.

To sum it up, this movie is a heartfelt, well written story, told with a lot of heart and sould, I love it, and I truly think that most people would enjoy it. Give it a try if you haven't! I'm feeling an 8.6/10 on this one.",8
25 May 2004,A Gem,"This story about a tough orphan who is an absolute genius struck a familiar note for me because Hunting (Matt Damon) reminds me of my father. Born at the turn of the 20th Century, his mother died after his birth and his father became such a drunkard and tyrant that my father left home at age 11 and did not complete school. A roughneck, stevedore, prize fighter, lumberjack, gun slinger, cowboy and rodeo rider, he finally married at the beginning of the Great Depression at the age of 30 to society girl and concert pianist who gentled him down. After I was born he sought a more stable and safe occupation and became a carpenter. He took correspondence courses to complete his education eventually getting his degrees in civil and construction engineering,

I knew he was smart in mathematics but I didn't know how smart until I took a geometry class from a teacher that was a retired professor from the University of California. One day he gave the class an problem that had never been solved. I took the problem home and asked my father if he could help me with it. Within an hour he had solved it. My professor was amazed. He gave me two more unsolved problems and my father solved both. Like Hunting he was an absolute mathematics genius. Nothing more came of it. My father was a brilliant construction engineer and that was his calling.

So the movie had a tone of authenticity to it. It was a good story although at times it was a bit contrived. I am not a fan of Robin Williams but his performance in this movie by itself made it worth watching. If there was a negative it was Minnie Driver who was miscast. Because she is an ugly duckling, perhaps that is why she was chosen but her acting and her accent were atrocious and I had to knock off a couple of stars on its rating. Otherwise, it is well worth anyone's time to watch.",8
16 September 2019,Manipulative and unrealistic,"Ramanujan? Really? If Ramanujan is the closest person to describe the genius of Will, well, you need to take into account sleepless nights Ramanujan was suffering, his dedication to mathematics and his ambition to be recognized. He was studying like hell. And still, there were many mistakes in his initial letters to British mathematician Hardy. The only reason movie chooses to portray a methematical in such an unrealistic dimension is to manipulate your feelings. And this is why you are better off by not watching this movie.

12 March 1999,a GOOD robin williams movie...,"GWH is just a good story. It's not necessarily believable, but I applaud the philosophy behind it: It burns the people of academia and their ""well educated and good"" intentions.

The bar sequence where Will eventually meets his love interest is one of the best movie sequences I've ever seen. He easily reduces a Harvard student to an embarrassed school boy by citing the exact sources of the student's knowledge, telling him what he'd be reading the next year, then topping it off by offering to ""take it outside.""

As for the rest of the movie, it continuously shows a math professor pushing Will to use his natural talent to become something he's simply not interested in. After all, he's still young, and he has a lot to learn and a lot of his past life to sort out in his mind.

Sean (Robin Williams) sees through all of this and helps Will out. The emotional element of this movie hinges heavily on this relationship and is very captivating. Likeable characters and a good story make this a 10 for sure. (watch out for the tears!)",10
3 August 2005,Trust,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",8
15 April 2013,Matt Damon + Ben Affleck = Genius Duo!,"A movie that amazed me from start to finish. The way that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this amazing story about a ""bad boy disturbed"" that the inside is a true genius. And that just needs help not only to show it to the world, but for himself, and at the same time helping those around you, but this is a short summary of what this Masterpiece has to give. Matt Damon it is superb, and it grabs his character (which he wrote) so impressive and credible; Robin Williams in one of his best roles, his character is the most beloved and fun (and a little perturbed), the entire cast does a phenomenal job, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Minnie Driver, Ben Affleck, all perfect. The film teaches us that we all have a soul mate, not a romantic, but one that challenges us and transforms us what we are in the future ... (I wish have both). A film very well done, very well written, we laugh, we cry, we learn, we see things in a differently way. And for all who feel alone in their lives, I just say ... ""It's not your fault!""

10 January 1999,Spectacular script,"Yet another script (much like Pulp Fiction) that deserved its Oscar. Damon, Williams, Affleck, and Driver are all wonderful as inner-city urbanites who try to make good on their respective talents, and the script leads them through a twisty maze of events on their way to a heartwarming ending. Williams isn't as overtly impressive here as in his historically great dramatic roles (Fisher King, World According to Garp, Dead Poets Society, Moscow on the Hudson), but his understated warmth justifies his Oscar-winning performance.

13 February 2009,Brilliant movie,"Let me start with the profanity: it is SO true to Boston, particularly South Boston (known as ""Southie""). (Southie is a particularly idiosyncratic neighborhood, as you can see from the way its inhabitants are portrayed.) The accents (even Robin Williams') rang true to this ex-Bostonian, and the dialogue was spot on. The script was perfect. And the performances were uniformly top-notch: Robin Williams was so believable as the educated psychiatrist who still hadn't left behind his Southie roots. He's never been better, before or since, which is a credit to Gus Van Sant.

I've been to MIT and Harvard, I've been to Southie, and I've lived in Boston. They are exactly as shown in the movie, warts and all. Hate on the movie if you will (and for the life of me, I cannot understand why), but you cannot attack its authenticity.

5 June 2006,"""If you disrespect my wife again, I will END YOU! Got that, sport?!""","The quote is from one of several memorable scenes from the movie, when Will presses Sean's buttons in their first meeting, only to be VERY surprised by his reaction (and also probably gaining respect for the man, which evolves into a genuine friendship). I just saw it again for the umpteenth time.

Other favorite scenes include his emotional confrontation with Skylar, in which he finally drops all pretenses and shows her the real him, and the final emotional scene with Sean, when Will finally bursts open like a dam.

Oh, lest I forget, Lambeau's surprise in the beginning, when he finds out who's been solving his mathematical puzzles, is a gem.

Everyone was outstanding. For Robin Williams, this performance ranks right up there with ""Awakenings"", ""Good Morning Vietnam"", and ""Dead Poet's Society""; the breadth and depth of the characters he's portrayed in all of these movies is amazing. He rightly deserved the Oscar. The man's a d*** genius.

Hard to believe this is the same guy who played Mork.

It's just too bad he hasn't had very many of these kinds of roles, and too many of the soppy, sentimental melodramas like ""Bicentennial Man"".

Mini Driver, though I'm not a fan of hers, was also very good, and added the right balance to Will.

Everyone, and everything about this movie was excellent; it hit all the right notes. My hats off to Damon and Affleck for their screenplay! Reading some of the negative comments about this film, I have to say I'm stunned. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but, if you didn't like this movie, I can't imagine there are very many you will like, as it doesn't get too much better than this.

What a shift for Matt Damon, from playing an anti Semite, upperclass, preppie jerk in another excellent film, ""School Ties"", to playing a blue collar, streetwise roughneck here.

I can't say enough good things about this movie!",10
3 June 2009,such a great movie,"I watched this movie for the first time last week and I was astounded. This really is a great movie that will have you thinking about it in the days after you watch it. The cast are great, the writings great, and the story is great.

I love these kind of films. There are far too man films made these days that tell you nothing. This is a special movie that you will walk away from with a smile on your face and a determination to do something more with yourself.

Matt Damon is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors now, and his performance here is superb, the same goes for Robin Williams. Minnie Driver is another actress who is supremely talented. Every individual involved gets top marks.

Good Will Hunting is a fantastic movie, one I will no doubt watch again and again.

1 December 2012,My All Time Favourite,"What can I say about this film? It features one of the greatest screenplays of the last 20 years, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, full of thought-provoking dialogue and some beautiful monologues, (My personal favourite is from Ben Affleck at the construction site about 3/4 of the way through the film). All the actors are great. Matt Damon perfectly embodies the role that he plays, an immature, cocky yet gifted boy in a world which he believes will wait for and build around him. Robin Williams plays an empathetic, yet gloomy psychologist who has never fully gotten over the death of his wife. Even Ben Affleck-haters will acknowledge Affleck's good work here, as Will Hunting's seemingly bonehead friend, who, as the film goes on, is revealed to be caring, empathetic man. Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard round out the cast, all of whom give good performances. The plot is something many of us can relate to: An overconfident, intelligent man who cannot be bothered to realise his full potential. The insecurities of Will Hunting are fleshed out in great detail by the script, Damon's performance and Gus Van Sant's use of close ups for a lot of the major scenes, showing Hunting's emotions in detail. However, in some of the crowd scenes, such as in classrooms, Van Sant lacks a little imagination, resorting to the same camera pan sequence over and over again. Nevertheless, he is a more than capable director who delivers for the most part here. Danny Elfman's use of music adds to the heartwarming factor of the film. The film won two Oscars, Robin Williams winning Best Supporting Actor as well as Damon and Affleck winning Best Original Screenplay. In addition to this, Damon, Van Sant, Driver, Elfman and editor Pietro Scalia, earned nominations for their efforts. The film was also nominated for best original song and best picture. I would recommend this film to anyone, however, parents should be careful with letting their children watch this, as it contains a lot of coarse language as well as frequent sexual references. A superb work of modern drama.",10
23 October 2000,Titanic got best picture?!,"It is ever so apparent that James Cameron bought his oscar, but had he not had paid out the academy, this film would've surely recieved the so called greatest accolade. This film is so moving, Ben and Mat have put together a magnificient story which can only be described as genius (no pun intended). I don't know what else to say but watch this movie. It is more of an experience than just a ""movie"". It is absolutely brilliant!

5 May 2020,Wish to have such a friend in life.,"Revisit dead poets society, though the film is more warm.In the self-righteousness of the small world to build a step ahead of others in order to protect themselves, mistaking the cynical world for brave, mistaking theory is reality, and fortunately there is always someone willing to understand you, understand you.The world is not fair, the genius of the crushing extraordinary people reach, but this loneliness must be matched to unlock, so he is very lucky.Otherwise can only say a ""invincible is how lonely"", such a genius is happy will reduce a lot of it.Wish to have such a friend in life.

19 May 2017,Superb movie making simply doesn't get any better than this,"Life affirming, spectacular acting especially between Matt Damon and Robin Williams. No car chases, no Hollywood, intelligent brilliant and my no 1 film of all time. Beautifully written directed acted and simply not to be missed. The characters are real and it tells the story of friendship, strength over adversity and hope. please watch this film. Outstanding. I guess it has extra meaning to me, coming from a broken abusive childhood. I was a child prodigy that survived ALL of the situations in Wills life, I survived and prospered, but not without the scars, 75% emotionally and 25% physically. The scars have healed long ago, but the mental/emotional ones have unfortunately stayed with me and there isn't much I can do about them. There is so much to like about this film, but the scenes between Matt Damon and Robin Williams will stay with me forever. Ben and Casey are also superb.

19 February 2004,An enriching cinema experience,"Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an orphan who has been to a number of abusive foster homes. At twenty, he starts working at the prestigious MIT as a caretaker on parole, since he's been involved in several assaults. One day the tough maths question on the board is found solved and the searching of the mystery genius begins. When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) realises it is Will who has solved the difficult tasks, he decides to help him by offering him working on further maths studies and seeing a psychotherapist. Talented and yet highly defensive, Will manages to scare all the shrinks away and eventually Professor Lambeau has to turn to psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), his university roommate for help.

Sean's unique approach finally touches the deep inside of Will's complex and it gradually dilutes Will's insecurity and distrust of people. Meanwhile, Will falls in love with Harvard med student Skylar (Minnie Driver) but later has to confront his inner uncertainty. In the end, Sean and Will helps each other to deal with their own issues.

I simply do not comprehend why on earth some people out there don't appreciate this film, and I don't think I have to, because I know this is a GOOD film. The acting is intense and the dialogue is witty and often hard for the actors to carry out reading. The story is about a highly intelligent young man who has too many past injuries to heal and who eventually is given a helping hand (two, actually) to rediscover himself. The ending is just a clever one. 9.9/10",
7 June 2014,A Simple Masterpiece,"I feel ashamed for putting this film off for so long. I had intended to watch it for a while, but kept making excuses. My reasoning for this was that the description of this film and it's somewhat simple plot line put me off, even though the film did have the likes of Robin Williams and Matt Damon in it. Yes, the film follows a simple plot line and proceeds exactly how you'd expect it to, but there's a beauty to it; a simple beauty. It tackles psychology and the nature and feelings of the youth. And it does it perfectly.

The writing of 'Good Will Hunting' was nigh perfect. I wasn't expecting something so thought provoking and intelligent from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's first screenplay. Again, it's simply done but has a unique beauty behind it. You can connect with the title character, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), and understand how he's feeling throughout it from his discussions with his psychiatrist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Damon and Affleck outdid themselves here.

Gus Van Sant directs the masterpiece. This is the first of his works I have came across. The directing fits the film perfectly. It's nothing big or exciting, just simple. Without the directing, the film simply would not feel the way it does. It adds to calm, slow nature of 'Good Will Hunting' and everything feels at perfect pace with the writing. The emotion is hit spot on as well, with obvious help from the actors.

I'd be lying if I said that I even noticed the music used in the film, which is a shame because I love Danny Elfman's other works. Everything was so focused on the raw emotion and I was so taken in by the characters. I cannot comment on the composition, but I will be able to eventually because I will definitely be watching this film again in the future. It's certainly a new one of my favourites.

The acting is astoundingly good. I had never seen Robin Williams out of his usual romantic comedy role before now, so this was a surprising and refreshing change. He plays the role of the aged psychiatrist perfectly. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver created amazing chemistry as their respective characters and Damon shines in his role throughout, getting every scene spot on. Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Ben Affleck got their roles spot on as well, as the rather egotistic professor who cares for his students and the loyal and loving best friend respectively.

Overall this was a simple masterpiece, which I did not expect in the slightest. It wasn't clich√©, as it was entirely unique in its own way, but it also had the simple plot line that you'd expect. 'Good Will Hunting' is a film I will certainly be watching again for its delightful and simple nature. If you haven't already seen this genius piece of work, I suggest that you make some time for it as soon as you can.",10
21 May 2014,Inspiring Flick,"""Your Potentiality is not known to you until others discover it in you"", Will Hunting an ordinary boy who works as a janitor in Massachusetts Institute of Technology spends his days with doing nothing special but he is endowed with quite good IQ power, he is actually a genius, once a mathematician professor Gerald challenge his students to solve the complex algebraic sum, Will Hunting solves it easily and gets the attention of professor Gerald, Will gets himself in some fights and get jailed, looking at an opportunity Gerald releases him on the condition to spend some time with him in solving the Mathematics sums and to consult the counselor and to get their advice, but it turns vein as Will show lack of interest to those counseling session, this makes Gerald to consult his college mate a psychologist Sean to help him in changing Will's behavior, he initially shows no interest but accepts to speak to Will, with speaking to him Sean get to know that Will with high IQ has quite low EQ, and he uses his defense mechanism to avoid any new contacts, meanwhile Will falls in love with a girl but fails to withstand that relation for long time, in other side Will becomes close with Sean and thus Sean become successful in building good rapport with Will, his motivation and inspiring word brings Will close to Sean and finally makes him to take a wise decision for his life.

With outstanding story-line and brilliant casting with some amazing dialogs makes 1997's 'Good Will Hunting' a perfect making, the plot is truly inspiring, you never find much better casting such as Robin Williams and Matt Damon for such an amazing character, the quotations used in this movies marks as a plus point, the screenplay in good, Robin Williams is marvelous, he is one among many performer who suits to any character given to him, and Matt Damon is very cool in his performance, it may be the scene of fight, sentiment or fun he gives full justice, must watch movie, truly inspiring.",9
3 December 2009,An amazing movie,"This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen. There's really nothing to dislike about it.

The characters are all well-acted and interesting. Robin Williams and Minnie Driver take the crown in the well-acted department though. Especially Driver is simply fantastic in her portrayal of Skylar. From the lovable joke-teller to the empathy-inducing grief-stricken girl, it's a career-defining performance.

The story itself has many layers and subplots, and delve deeply into inter-character relationships. The interaction between Will and his buddies and Skylar and McGuire, the interaction between McGuire and Lambeau... there's a lot more depth than in most movies. Combined with the excellent acting, it really makes this one one to remember and savor.

The whole thing makes you think about your own life and your own choices, both past and future ones. And that on its own is enough to make it a good movie, but it's still so much more. As said in the beginning, definitely one of my all-time favorites.",10
5 January 2014,One of the BEST Movies Ever Made!,"This review is spoiler-free. Please read on, especially if you haven't seen it yet.....

Never has a film emotionally touched me more than this. Hands down, one of the best drama films I've ever seen. My father showed this movie to me at a young age. Unfortunately, he died not too long ago and I'm so thankful he showed me this wonderful film. After watching it several times in recent months, I observed some of the strengths that made him enjoy it as much as I did. Despite its noticeable flaws, it still holds up and leaves an impact in my heart!

Is it slow-paced and predictable? Oh there's no denial about that yet it connects with us on such a deep level and gives us time to learn about these interesting characters. Also, the pacing is so hypnotic that I still didn't want to stop watching, even after it ended. The vast majority of people who dislike it are either disappointed by the hype it received or are offended by the excessive profanity. My solution for these two issues is incredibly simple. One is to get passed its publicity and just take it for what it is. As for the constant swearing, try not to judge the movie based on how times the F word is spoken and instead, merely appreciate the flow of dialogue or solely listen to the purpose of why things are being said. The only way to know whether it's good or not is to watch it. I'm aware that this movie isn't for everyone, but I personally recommend you sit down and watch it from beginning to end, even if you hate it afterward.

For quite some time, it's been speculated that Kevin Smith and Rob Reiner at one point did revisions on the script, all the better for it! This movie is brilliantly written with powerful scenes and an alluring plot that revolves around a troubled man (played by the talented Matt Damon) who needs direction in life. Its internal conflict is something that is thought provoking with an astonishing payoff. The characters are alive and believable, while Van Sant effectively puts the audience in the right atmosphere. Some fans might have been disappointed with the apparent blandness of Skylar (played by Minnie Driver) or perhaps her weak performance, but I think she tried her best and had excellent chemistry with Will.

In conclusion, watch this movie to see how amazing it is. Anyone who was associated with ""Good Will Hunting"" should be proud of themselves, because they have earned my respect as an audience member. Not exactly a masterpiece, but something you can relate to and care about!",10
27 November 2002,one of the best ever,"Simply one of the best movies ever produced. Incredibly moving, razor sharp, beautiful, strong, life-affirming. Great sound track, too. Best career performance of Williams and probably every other actor in the cast. Incredible piece of work. Will stand the test of time.

25 May 2006,"Outstanding drama, with great depth","'Good Will Hunting' will always remain one of my favorite movies. It has an engaging storyline, great acting, and enormous emotional depth. It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they conceived of this complex story.

The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at Harvard University. He also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius, and catches the attention of award-winning math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard.

Will, however, has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics. He only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the professor, being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there. Part of his parole deal, however, is to meet with a therapist twice a week. After getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him, Will finally lands with psychology teacher Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who has a similar background as Wills', hailing from the same tough neighborhood in south Boston.

As Sean tries to get through to Will emotionally, the professor tries to train Will's mind in advanced mathematics. All the while, Will, who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past, begins to get seriously involved with a girl named Skylar (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, the professor and the psychiatrist, who've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day, begin to quibble over what's best for Will's future.

Filled with great profound dialogs and intense emotional scenes, it's an immense emotional experience. It obviously has very 'heavy' subject-matter, and thus not an easy light watch, but it is very rewarding and entertains throughout.

It's also a great buy because you will need repeated viewings to appreciate all its subtleties.",10
6 August 2000,still a great film ..,"It is interesting to watch ""Good Will Hunting"" again, nearly three years after its release. It remains as fresh on second or third or subsequent viewings as on its first.

What stands out is not the plot, which is straightforward and really only a device to provide a backdrop to explore the central characters, but brilliance of Affleck and Damon's dialogue.

The combination of wit, naturalness and directness combine to engage the viewer.

Even more amazing is that the film is driven by a series of dialogue sequences and each sequence builds on it predecessor pushing the plot forward.

Rarely has a film been so dialogue driven and yet not been ""talky"". This is due entirely to Matt and Ben's extraordinary way with dialogue and Gus Van Sant's simple and very effective direction which places no barriers between the characters and the viewer.

I am sure that this, not the plotting, is what impressed the Oscar voters.

""Good Will Hunting"" remains one of the finest American films of the decade.",7
4 March 2019,A Pure Masterpiece for TEN,"A great story full of twists and turns, filled with lessons for a lifetime. This was and still is an extraordinary piece by Matt and Ben. Also from the screenwriting point , this one is one of a kind. So effectivelly written with its characters really show their feelings without telling it. Just best of the best.

28 January 1999,Typical Oscar Nominee,"""Good Will Hunting"" (1997:***). For awhile, I didn't think I was going to like this movie; there are too many clay-pigeon stupid jerks introduced simply to be demolished by the superhuman intelligence of Will Hunting (hated that bar scene, especially). It's a relief when Robin Williams finally shows up as his therapist, because you sense that this cocky but self-destructive kid has finally met his match. The heart of the picture is the prickly relationship between these two, even though it does lead to the inevitable (and still potent) breakdown scene in which the mixed-up young man cries on his therapist's shoulder (e.g., ""Ordinary People,"" ""Prince of Tides,"" etc.). There are almost as many scenes in this movie that don't work as do (the dreadful one in which Hunting substitutes Ben Affleck, as his best friend, for himself in a job interview should have been cut). But a good supporting cast and some tangy Boston atmosphere helps, and Matt Damon finally does win you over. This is also one of Robin Williams' best dramatic performances. He really anchors the film. I'd be interested to know how much input he (and others) had on the original screenplay written by Damon and Affleck. All-in-all pretty good.

12 October 2019,The human mindset as an open book.,"A lot of people are trying to hide their feelings behind their behaviour like Matt in this movie. When you went through difficult times, you never felt love, you don't know what unconditional guidance means you are afraid of many things but the most from your own self.

This movie shows us the mindset and the feelings behind the ""titles"", it shows us what human connection means and how difficult is to achieve it!

The plot is more than a story about a genius guy and a success story, it's a diamond of psychology into two hours.

I definitely recommend it and I also recommend to see the real meaning and not just the affairs.

11 March 1999,One of the most boring movies I have seen in my whole life,"I love Robin Williams and believe he's the greatest actor in the whole world. I collect his movies and watch them over and over again. However, I didn't like GWH at all. It's impossible for me to understand how this movie got so many positive reviews. I found it boring and silly at the same time.

31 December 2019,It's almost 2020 and this film was so ahead of its time,"I have never written a review before. I have rated a great many films and TV series but there was one scene in this film that so profoundly affected me, that I had to comment about it. Now I have watched this film several times since it was made and really enjoyed it, but today 12/30/19, I had to comment on this one particular scene in the movie. The scene is when Will is meeting with the NSA guy, regarding why he should join the clandestine agency. First may I say, how ahead of its time Will's explanation is, as to why he should not join the NSA. It is prior 911 and prior to any current scrutiny of these agencies. Will's response to why he shouldn't join the organization is unbelievably prophetic, considering it was written 22 years ago. His explanation of why he shouldn't, should make every proud citizen struggling to survive, question the current standards and practices of our government agencies including and especially our president's. Will's response explains the actions of the agency and its consequences to the average american citizen. So if you are a reasonable adult, who values morality and is now questioning or possibly doubting our current government agencies, politicians and our presidenct due to questionable tactics and policies, please watch this scene in the movie. Just do so with an open heart and mind. PS, by the way I highly recommend you watch the entire movie as it an incredible and enjoyable watch but that scene is like a crystal ball into our current future. I am really extremely impressed by Matt and Ben's work and vision.",10
15 March 2011,Brilliant take on coming age-of-teens.,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wasn't a very common name to Hollywood in the 90s. They only came in 'average' films that nobody cared about. Fortunately, they won respect from everyone after this film came out...

Getting to my 'review', this film is literally brilliant, dashingly shot, brilliant acted, warmly directed, and profoundly written. Damon and Affleck truly mesmerized me in the film. The acting was great; Damon, Affleck, Williams, Driver, and Sk√†rsgard were all perfect.

The script was true and understandable, because of the literal and profound combinations of powerfulness. The 'young' men deserved their Academy Award for their script...

As for the Academy Awards (themselves) for a disappointment. Titanic didn't deserve what it got, (especially Best Picture). All the films were simply ruled out, with this one only winning TWO! Williams and Damon/Affleck went home with grins, but the WHOLE cast should have...

Other than that, this film is outstanding in every way and shouldn't be missed by older teens and adults alike. The strong message in the end was out-rightly plausible and touching.",10
11 May 2003,Good!!,"This is a sound satisfactory performance from all involved.

For first timers, Damon & Affleck do well but the real chemistry sizzles between a laid back Robin Williams & Damon. Williams returns acting to the old Hollywood style of gestures and emotive expressions and says a lot more with his eyes, demeanour and personality.

This is a defining moment for Williams who convincingly breaks from the slapstick comedy gamut to settle into a thoroughly serious role and gives the performance of a lifetime.

The scene where he breaks thru Damon's chaotic personality with the mesmerising but calming ""It's not your fault, it's not your fault"" just blew me away

I came away feeling enriched by the entire experience, with a lot of admiration for Affleck and Damon but with great respect for Robin Williams. He is indeed an actor's actor.

Good Will Hunting delivers soundly.

10/10 Overall!!!!!!!!",10
18 June 2005,Good Will Hunting,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

28 September 1998,Matt Damon sticks to the formula in this cliche ridden drama.,"Haven't we seen this one before? Matt Damon must have looked at everything that's won awards in the history of the Academy and included every cliche he could scavenge into his screenplay.

1. The angst-ridden genius who resents his gift, because everybody he knows is trying to force him into a better life. A life he doesn't want because he's happy just being an average loser like all his friends.

2. The teacher who discovers him, who we are meant to believe genuinely wants to help him, but by the end we find out just wants to live his own lost dreams vicariously through his prodigy.

3. The psychiatrist who has troubles of his own, so by the end of the film they unwittingly help each other out.

4. Of course a romantic interest has to be thrown in to create the standard conflict. Should he choose a life with his friends, his girl, or a high paying job. Naturally he chooses to abandon everything and run off to a girl he barely knows. I hope I'm not the only one who saw that coming a mile away. Men are always portrayed as saps in these types of films.

Robin Williams gives us another one of his trademark two characters. He's always either manic and over-the-top, or quiet and introverted. In this case we get the latter, essentially the same guy we saw in Awakenings. I prefer him in the manic roles, at least then I don't have to suspend my disbelief enough to accept Mork giving psychological advice.",

18 August 2015,Where's the pizazz?,"I can't believe how melodramatic, dull, boring, and overrated this movie is. This is one of the most well-loved films ever, but I hated this movie. Absolutely hated it. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. :P

Normally, I like Matt Damon, but I couldn't stand his character was in this movie. For an actor who was just starting out, I think he might have been trying a little bit too hard, if not way too hard.

This is an over-dramatic and boring movie, and Robin Williams didn't help. Robin Williams was such a funny actor (RIP), but his character was dull and boring. I don't think any comedian's character should be this serious. How about a little bit more pizazz? I'm sorry. I know several people like this movie, but I feel guilty for wasting two hours of my day sitting through this movie. :(

6 May 2001,Really quite slick and cool.,"What I heard about this movie prior to seeing it sparked my interest more than usually happens, the Oscars didn't really have a lot of bearing but they helped, and what is more I am not disappointed with it.

Matt Damon plays a young Indiana Jones (IJATLC) sort of character, he knows history like the back of his hand, he can spout poetry, titles, quotes and even entire sentences from a specific book as easy as his name. With the winning script they do their best to avoid most of the cle she's, they do not glorify what he can do very much, just enough to establish the extent of it, they make a lot of mention of previous cases of genius discovered in a strange place just so that your disbelief retreats a little, and they down play the whole teacher relationship details and leave the inevitable kids change to accepting the teacher to a single, clear and early point.

It manages to be attractive and entertaining but also with relevance to reality and people relationships. Wills trouble with accepting people does not come off as corny and unbelievable but one of a few prominent aspects that have front row seats. You really have to like the movie for it's rich entertainment status. One unsettling thing is the lack of conclusion to the ending but it is probably better that way, what was shown at the ending would make the difference between one category and another, it keeps the focus on the right parts of the movie.

Williams never really reaches great in his performance, he basically just plays a recessive person and sincerely states some lines, compare his supporting performance to say, Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter, there is a role with some content and depth, or, though I know this will cause trouble, Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator, just as Crowe brought some winning depth to a done time-and-again character so too did Phoenix, through tears, amusement, heartbreak and rage he constructed an in depth performance. Williams win to some extent confirms the history of the award though, how did John Geilgud for his one track comedy role in Arthur, or Don Ameche for a single teary scene in Cocoon or Sean Connery for playing a mature version of the same character he had always played win, it's a career award, Williams has had an entire career of comedy roles and been nominated three times previous, such a change in this role and the fact that it was time brought the win.

Back on the movie, it really is cool, though not as impacting as Titanic it well deserved its nomination. This film gets a solid 8.5, it isn't 100% original so consequently can't take all the credit, but see this movie if you have not already, it is more than worth it.",

Also the soundtrack is wonderful, it lives up to the movie! I can listen it for hours on end and never get tired of it. It is a must add for any collection. The music is sure to inspire anyone. Elliott Smith is a great song writer. Miss Misery and Say Yes together make the soundtrack worth buying. Along with them is a terriffic cast of other songs, many of them written and performed by Elliott Smith. You will never get tired of the CD or the Movie!

16 March 2022,For Want of a Crash,"Disillusionment is a profound luxury, for a library has been built over the blood of many, similarly unendowed, and dissimilarly acknowledged for their worth, for a little word in either context while creating ripples in the immediate surroundings of one could set fire to an industry in the other for not being able to contain the ripples in an age where fishes are finned at sea only to be grilled on land. This interpretation is starkly evident in the climax where the pain of guilt is neatly suspended for a new lease of life shelved abruptly back home by those who call dibs at being the underdog at leading with the chin at subliminal treachery.

20 June 2005,Deserves much more credit than it gets,"I avoided seeing ""Good Will Hunting"" for years due to its reputation as a ""bad pic disguised as an Indie flick"". Then, one night, I decided to try it. How bad could it be? If it was awful, I figured, at least with Affleck it oughta be funny (in an unintentional way).

But guess what? It wasn't funny. It wasn't bad. In fact, it was pretty near great.

The story has been done before, albeit in slightly different form, so don't look for anything too special here. Young Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is, secretly, a mathematical genius, who puts out a rebellious attitude to disguise this. While working as a janitor, his talent is discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard), and from there Will's life is changed forever. He meets his dream girl (Minnie Driver) and undergoes psychological therapy in an attempt to fix up his attitude. The only shrink who has any chance with Will, however, is another college professor: Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams. Along with his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will embarks on a journey that will change his life forever.

Damon and Affleck, at the time relatively new to film-making, grabbed an Academy Award for ""Best Original Screenplay"" for writing the tale of ""Good Will Hunting"". Williams also received an Academy Award for ""Best Supporting Actor"", and the film was nominated for seven other awards including ""Best Picture"". The cast is terrific here - even Affleck isn't horrible - but it's Damon and Williams whose performances really reach out and grab you.

Someone who should have won an Oscar was director Gus Van Sant. His unique directing style gets moving performances from the entire cast and really brings to life Damon and Affleck's otherwise ordinary script. There's also a not-so-remarkable score by Danny Elfman.

I find this film to be severely underrated. If you give it a small chance, it will really have an effect on you. ""Good Will Hunting"" is one of the best films of the year, a shlock flick turned into a touching wonder. This movie really deserves much more credit than it gets.",8
6 March 2002,Great movie,"An instant classic. The plot is outstanding. The script is also very good, though sappy at times. The acting is wonderful. Matt Damon is very talented. And I think this is one of Robin Williams' best performance ever! The only problem: Ben Affleck. He is a good writer, but he's a TERRIBLE actor. Luckily, his character is not very important even though it has a lot of screen time. One of my top 20 movies. 9/10

14 July 2020,An admirable utopian behavioral film,"A few words about the script who won 1998 Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and let's stay in the field of mathematics of non-logical axioms. The two young writers (at the time they wrote the script Matt Damon was 25 years old and Ben Affleck 23) have created utopian characters, as they would have liked to behave, and which cannot be found in real life (based on Damon short experience at Harvard University). Comparing what the movie tell us and what is confirmed in real life, based on my experience of over 40 years, and especial the last 20, the screenplay is misleading and is based on a perplexing postulate that states that ""If A, B, C are TRUE behaviors of GROUP X then D behavior, which belongs of GROUP X, CAN BE TRUE. For an inexperienced person, D's credibility is no longer disputed and is considered as a true behavior. But D is FALSE because it's the exception of GROUP X. Perplexity decreases when group size increases. Let's take a few examples: 1. Professor Gerald Lambeau's interest in revealing a superior intelligence even than his own. FALSE behavior. In the university system, and beyond, it is a fierce struggle to secure your supremacy. 2. Chuckie Sullivan concern for Will Hunting's future as a failure. FALSE behavior. We all know that the enemy stabs you in front and the friend in the back. 3. The behavior of the main character itself. If he had such a remarkable mind for mathematics, please believe me, his social behavior would have been quite different. And the examples could continue. Otherwise, an admirably well-made film just like a fairy tale. Damon and Affleck were each paid salaries of $600,000, while the film grossed over $225 million at the worldwide box office.",8
7 September 2006,"Despite one or two flaws, worth watching for some excellent performances and a fairly original story","Having been meaning to see this film for a long time I finally managed to last week and was largely impressed.

The film is very entertaining and has many memorable scenes of great acting and writing that are some of the best out there. I don't want to get into the plot other than say it is fairly plausible and original, borrowing from other genres but never feeling like its something we've seen before.

First of all, I'll talk about the films most impressive aspects. The best thing about this film by far is Robin Williams. I haven't seen too much of his dramatic work but his performance here is certainly the best I've seen him give and was definitely deserving of his Oscar. He wonderfully delivers some of the best emotional scenes in the film and is brilliant in virtually every scene he's in. Similarly, Minnie Driver is impressive as Will's girlfriend and brings a lot of welcome humour and credibility to her role and, along with Williams, keeps the film mature and not too immature- something I'll talk about soon. Similarly, Stellan Skarsgard is solid as a mathematician both jealous and fascinated by Will's talents.

The other good thing about the film is many scenes in the film. Many of the scenes between Will and Sean are well written and their is a fascinating and compelling speech made by Damon towards the end of the film on his refusal to work for the government.

The always excellent Danny Elfman delivers a very good score also.

Unfortunately these good aspects are held back by the completely unnecessary amount of gratuitous swearing throughout and average performances of Damon and Ben Affleck. If profanity is done tastefully and humorously (as shown by Quentin Tarantino) or is said out of desperation then that can help the material work. Here it doesn't. I didn't keep count but this film has an unbelievable amount of bad language that added nothing to the story and just felt like it was being used to fill dead spots in a conversation.

Another problem is the character of Will. He is far too cocky, arrogant and foul-mouthed to evoke sympathy and I believe his character should have been altered to make him a little more likable. Similarly Damon (despite one or two decent emotional scenes) is not very impressive either. Then again, thats probably his characters fault. The most annoying aspect of the film is Ben Affleck's character who I actually got so annoyed with I felt as though his screen time should have been shortened by half. Like Damon's, his character is the complete opposite to the one he plays in Armageddon and is largely unlikable and unappealing given he acts so stupidly throughout. Affleck (again, despite one good scene towards the end) therefore is unable to bring likability to his role either.

However, thanks to an original and intriguing story, some excellent performances by Williams, Driver and Skarsgard, the film is well worth watching.

14 July 2005,Excellent,"This Movie was one of the Few movies, with Robin Williams in, I have enjoyed also insomnia, One Hour Photo. Robin plays his character really well, and makes this film the success it was, from an actor which seems to me, Has done so many children movies, he comes across like the forever daft laugh a lot actor not to be taken seriously but it was a surprise when i saw him, now i like him. Minnie Driver looks sexy as hell playing Matt Damon's girlfriend, I'm a huge Matt Damon fan, and if you like him, you must own this. Matt Damon Of course is who the movie focuses on, and he proves how well he can play any part given to him, a boy cleaning the school floors is actually the most brightest lad, the school has. Ben Affleck plays will hunting's best friend. & there's abit in the end, which i really liked, between the Damon/Affleck characters which made the end enjoyable. Id Advise this movie for everybody to watch, you will enjoy it if you like a good drama. Written by both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck winning them both their first 2 Oscars. Proving how Talented Matt Damon & Ben Affleck truly are. You'll see a young boy, living life on the edge actually achieve a goal, & climbing through a lot of obstacles.

4 August 1998,A spectacular achievement of screenwriting and acting,"Those who call Good Will Hunting ""predictable"" are missing the point. This is a movie that shines on dialogue, both comedic and dramatic, that is written and delivered with a poetic flair. The humorous sequences will have you laughing out loud (I especially liked the ""Sandwich purchased on lay-away"" bit), and the drama will hit you like a punch to the stomach. Suspension of disbelief was immediate, even with the premise, and it held me inthralled throughout its length. Sure, the ending is predictable, but it's the journey, and not the destination, that made Good Will Hunting the best film of 1997.

6 April 1999,Overshadowed by the Big Boat,"If it weren't for that damn Titanic movie(don't get me wrong I didn't hate Titanic) the Best Picture Race would've been a lot more interesting. The Full Monty still would've been a long shot but that leaves you with three of the greatest movies in recent years: L.A Confidential, As Good As it Gets, and my personal favorite, Good Will Hunting. Good Will Hunting is a movie masterpiece. Matt Damon and Ben Afleck are sensational actors and even better writers. Robin Williams finally got an Oscar(long overdue) for what I think might be his best performance yet, second only to Dead Poets Society. The chemistry between Williams and Damon is remarkable. Minnie Driver was great too. This is definitely a must see!

30 May 2019,From Bottom to Top,"I see a movie with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and I tend to drift away from it but this film was different. Matt and Ben tend to be dry, boring actors and never tend to be in very interesting films. They fit into the characters so well you would think they were actually real people. Although I never really enjoy movies with either of these actors I thought this film was very well done. I give it a 10/10! A film of brilliance, heartbreak, rebellion, and a wild adventure. Knowing that they directed this movie I thought the plot would be awful but it really captured the essence of human nature. Matt and Ben really got into character and captured the true personality of two boys from 1980""s South Boston. From roaming the streets, bar fights, to the accents and the culture.

Will is a young boy at the bottom of the social pyramid who has lived a lonely, abusive life. He works as a janitor at MIT but is yet extremely intelligent and begins solving their problems that not even the professors could do. Because of his lifestyle and who he is it's not okay for him to express his intelligents to society.

This film tells a story that is quite common yet is hidden from the world. Will (Matt) is highly intelligent yet he never puts it to use. People continue to push him to move forward and use his abilities yet he chooses not to. He's at the bottom of the social pyramid but has the ability to be at the top. People read into him and he feels threatened by that so he tries to outsmart them by reading deeper into them tearing them apart. Just like any movie there is always a girl but it isn't all lovey dovey. This movie captures the struggle of love in which he struggles with from his early childhood. Will picks up a girl at the bar and they talk and grow closer until she falls in love with him. She tries to push him to do something with his abilities and be a part of his life but that scares him so he tells her he doesn't love her even though he truly does. He fears being loved and hurting her.

This movie really deals about vulnerability, fear, friendship, and of course love. Will feels vulnerable being loved by a woman. A relationship would make him have to open up in which he fears because he feels as if he doesn't deserve love. He fears the judgement. Robin shows how powerful love really is by talking about his wife whom even though is dead he constantly cherishes their moments together and shares them, his life still revolves around her, he expresses happiness then and now. Will is scared to share his potential with the world because he doesn't know what that might bring upon him and others. He's scared to see how society will view him. He enjoys his abilities but is fearful to put them into the world. Will's therapist whom is Robin Williams tries to read into Will in which Will begins to try and stab at him and this continues for multiple sessions and some sessions are just silent with no talking. Robin waits for Will to make the first move of speaking because he's not going to solve his problems for him. The most simple stories lead to the most valuable advice in which Will slowly starts to accept and they form a friendship. Eventually Will goes and gets the girl, he opens up and brings himself out there, he wants happiness and love. He started at the bottom and slowly climbs his way to the top.

Overall, this movie is very well done. It's like a psych lesson. This movie is relate able to real life because there are many people out there just like Will and yet we turn a blind eye to them and they never get to express their true potential. The movies ends unknowingly just like real life, we never know where we will end up we can only imagine what will happen to us next and proceed to take those steps. It captures the human nature that we are too afraid to bring ourselves too. Highly interesting, charismatic, brilliant, rebelling film.",10
5 November 2016,Good Will Hunting Review,"Good Will Hunting is one of those films that make you stay in front of the screen until the credits rolls. The script, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, is simply incredible and earned the Best Original Screenplay in the Oscars of 1998. Right from the first scenes there is a break of paradigms which make us realize that Good Will Hunting is not some random film. Along the plot also has a series of social critiques and even the picture being of 1997, these critiques are still current. The director, Gus Van Sant, by choosing a movie style calmer, clean and without many camera movements made the right decision. Another positive aspect of the direction was in certain conversations, the decision to keep a closed camera in the face of some character and slowly opening the plan to show the rest of the scenery. This method was great, because it caught all the facial expressions of the character and even when he was not talking, you could see how he reacted to the other talking, but none of this would be possible if it were not for the brilliant work of the actors.

Matt Damon is Will hunting, an individual with a great mathematical intellect. His performance is spectacular, even the character having a great degree of complexity. He isn't just some math genius, he also has doubts, fears, just like everyone else and Damon's performance manages to convey to the public each emotion that the character is being through. The character's development is also worth mention, because each choice that Will makes increases his importance and gives a greater weight to the story.

Robin Williams as Sean Maguire is also amazing; his performance won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1998. The talks between him and Will are one of the high points of the film. The actors have an incredible dynamic and provide exciting scenes. He and Damon excel in the dialogues, their monologues and arguments are breathtaking, especially the ones from Damon who sometimes gives big monologues fast, that makes me wonder if all that was in the script or some lines were improvised.

I must mention Ben Affleck (Chuckie Sullivan), Casey Affleck (Morgan O'Mally), Cole Hauser (Billy McBride) and Stellan Skarsg√•rd (Gerald Lambeau). The first three are Will's friends, the scenes in which the four are together serve mostly as comic relief and surely, they work as such. However when the scene tends to a more dramatic and serious talk, they did not fail either. The three enable so that there is a better construction of the characters and the audience feels more comfortable and close to them. From the three, props to Ben Affleck's character, he's the closest to Will, he might be not smart as Will and shine in funny scenes, but when it's a serious talk, the scene in the demolished buildings for example is impressive, he shows his other side.",10
29 May 2019,Its all about the relationships,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9

28 May 2019,inspiring,"This film is a 10/10, it revealed to me that being vulnerable and communicating with others is needed to over come our traumas. Will expresses intelligence instead of vulnerability throughout the film so he doesn't have to confront his emotions. Sean was one person who helped Will shed the layers of built up traumas that were holding him back from his true potential. The end of the Film was satisfying knowing that Will makes a move out of true love.

19 May 2001,The screenwriting's on the wall...,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give very good performances in this film but the thing that baffles me and I can never seem to understand is why they won an Oscar for this screenplay. Not that the screenplay wasn't good, it was. But why did THEY win? As far as I gather all Damon and Affleck wrote was the first draft of the screenplay. But their version was some sort of horrible action film about a math genius on the lam from a crooked government trying to exploit his talents, involving high-speed car chases and buildings exploding etc. It wasn't until William Goldman, an experienced screenwriter was hired, that the film became this ""inner-growth and maturity"" story that eventually got released. Goldman wrote the bulk of the screenplay alone and didn't even get credit as a script-consultant. As far as the credits of the film are concerned, he wasn't even there. Of course Damon and Affleck came up with the main-character and some of the stuff in the script themselves, but they did not write the script that was actually filmed. And it really makes sense. How could two such inexperienced writers produce a first screenplay of such quality and go from rags to riches literally overnight? Sounds exciting doesn't it? Just the kind of story Hollywood likes to tell. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give even better performances in real life than in the film itself. For those who are in doubt, check out their writing filmography and see how many films they have written since GWH.",
12 June 2018,Inspiring,"358/5000 This movie makes us think well in our future. We can have the facilities and not use them correctly, even if it seems the best for everyone else. We have to focus on something that makes us feel happy and complete. For we can, under any circumstances, use them to our advantage. So that's what I learned from Will and the psychologist.

5 June 2002,I had a harder time than others with this movie,"An incredibly handsome working class boy with little formal education who knows absolutely everything and can outthink the finest university mathematician is not unlikely--it is impossible. Take it from a mathematician. If you care for a shred of credibility in your movies, forget this one. It is pure fantasy, as is the director's other shamelessly self-indulgent movie, the low-budget ""My Own Private Idaho.""

2 October 1999,Good Will Falling,"Falling flat is what this movie does, ever since the pretentious beginning: the attempt to capitalize on a presumed genius from the slums falls short of the target simply because while saying f*** every two words is true to life for more people than we want to know, a universal 'genius' as the one portrayed by Damon is nowhere to be seen, or conceived. The kind of 'knowledge' displayed by Damon is mostly fruit of dumb and trite photographic memory, and does not have the least to do with 'intelligence': as for the mathematical part it's pure fantasy, because Ramanujan may well have lived and impressed 100 years ago (mind me, he still impresses now), but would have a much harder time if he lived today. Speaking as a mathematician, it is shocking to see how carefully the movie tries to depict low life, and how easily it falls into the most stereotypical misconceptions about 'higher learning'. Overindulgence in realistic reproduction of a southie's foul language and scars, flanked by stale and flat portrayal of the MIT mathematics department may say it all: the script authors obviously share more with f*** than with f(x).

1 June 2023,A good story elevated by fine lead-role acting,"When Robin Williams gets it right it can result in an engrossing watch. He certainly gets it right here.

Williams plays Sean, a somewhat washed up but highly perceptive psychologist, who is drafted in to an American University to help save a gifted teenager from himself.

The teenager is Will, played by Matt Damon - a tough kid from the rough side of town who has an extraordinary gift for complex mathematics but doesn't value it. He is cynical, he is difficult, and his ambition goes no higher than having low paid manual work to pay for a few beers with his trusted mates.

The story tells of the developing relationship between Will and Sean as they battle it out for the moral and intellectual high ground, and of Will's troubled relationship with love interest Skylar (Minnie Driver).

It is in the moments of fine dialogue and high tension between these three that the film shines. The characters are strong, the relationships believable, and the dialogue is sharp and intelligent.

There are moments of humour, and a few hammy moments too, but overall it is a fine film elevated to a greater level thanks to the excellent dialogue and fine acting of the two lead roles.

An enjoyable and engaging watch.",8
31 May 2003,Brilliant and inspiring,"Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is the janitor at the most prestigeous college in the country. He is also the most brilliant person there. He solves incredibly difficult equations in minutes, where it took others years to. He is well read in history, mathematics, and art. But spends his days drinking with his buddies. It is not until one of the professors (Stellan Skarsgard) discovers his genius, that his life starts to turn around for the better. But he also has alot of anger. As a part of Will's probation, he must see a shrink (Robin Williams). Will also meets a girl (Minnie Driver) that seems to be his soul mate. With the help of Sean the shrink and Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will acknowledges his potential and his abandonment issues. This movie is very well written and acted. Most especially by Damon and Williams. It shows that even the most complex person can find solace and understanding in others, if he only opens up. The movie was nominated for 9 Academy awards, it was truly one of those special feel good movies that had a message. And has quickly become one of my favorite films.

RATING: **** out of ****",10

30 October 2020,Brilliant love story,"Besides, Will Hunting's great story, thoughtful conversations, developed characters' traits, attractive narrative, even some mathematical proofs, there is intriguing love story. The relationships between Will and Skylar is not a kind of relationship that only genius as Will might have. They loved each other, and both had struggle to accept this fact. For Will, as a mathematician he likes certainty in all things, and long relationships for him are uncertain. He keeps asking himself whether this girl is right choice and where he would be after. As for Skylar, she seeks for education and she needs from him confirmation of his love. The story tells that the right girl is the one for whom you are willing to sacrifice the most valuable thing. I personally find this idea attractive, because it seems to be one of the important decisions and there is only one moment in your life when you will have such feeling.

13 September 2000,Well crafted film that essentially glorifies white-trash.,"Well acted and written film. However, it follows in a long tradition in Western culture of romanticizing white-trash. The recipe is usually the same. Take a working class loser, make him very handsome, brave, charming, and extremely intelligent, then contrast him against well educated people who are shown to be sexually frustrated, neurotic, and otherwise unhappy, and you create a white-trash hero. ""Good Will Hunting"" plays this game very effectively. By the end of the film it has you believing the classic lie that education is unnecessary and all that matters in life is that you get the girl. Still, a good film at what it tries to do. However, one should watch an episode of Jerry Springer after seeing this film to remember what uneducated white-trash are really like.

22 September 2014,Good Will Hunting Review,"Every now and then I like to step away from reviewing a new theatrical or Blu-ray release and talk about movies that have already been out for some time now.I,as I'm sure the rest of the world,am still deeply hurt to hear about the tragic death of Robin Williams.So I wanna share my opinions on one of his most celebrated movies and movie roles in Good Will Hunting. William Hunting is a young,South Boston raised punk who works as a janitor at M.I.T.Ironically,despite being ""just a janitor"",Will can solve math equations that baffle even the school's top professors.After anonymously solving a nearly impossible math problem posted in the school halls,he gets the attention of one of the school math professors. With the teachings of Prof. Lamdeau,played by Skarsgard,and regular therapy visits with a community college psychology professor,Will gets the opportunity to really show just what his young brain is capable of while also finding a person he can open up and connect to in, Dr. Sean Macguire played flawlessly by the late,Robin Williams. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both won Oscars for their screenplay of this movie back when it released and believe me when I say that this movie's script is one of the best in film in my opinion.I know that's a stretch but every character conversation,no matter what the mood of the scene,is filled with interesting and important dialog.I literally won't watch this movie with out subtitles just because I don't wanna risk missing an important piece of info or some character development.There are scenes in this movie that can bring me tears with either sadness or hilarity,this is definitely a layered movie.All this makes the story that much more believable and that of course makes for extremely likable and developed characters.Seriously even minor characters have their moments throughout. With these great characters,you definitely get great performances.Matt Damon is as good as I've ever seen him,he has these one takes where he goes on and on spewing out all this mind numbing but intriguing dialog.Ben Affleck is in this one,however he really plays the secondary character here.That doesn't mean he doesn't get a few good scenes here and there,I actually liked his character as well.Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard both give really good supporting performances as well.As for Mr.Williams,I really don't have to say anything.What more need be said by now,you know? His performance in this movie puts you through so many different emotions as does his character and it works SO effectively,he's perfect! The music by Danny Elfman is subtle but really kicks when it has to and the cinematography is also actually very good after I rewatched this on Blu-ray.Gus Van Sant may not be a houshold name but he really has this way of making the movie seem almost like a documentary sometimes,he brings realism to his films and a lot of welcomed depth to his characters. With this review I'd like to say one last goodbye to my childhood hero,Robin Williams and praise his performance as well as this film that still gets me Every time!You can call it a sympathy rating but I cant help but give this movie a perfect 10/10 because its MY review and despite the circumstances,this is really a GREAT film and I love it.Of course I give GOOD WILL HUNTING MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. BUY THIS MOVIE!",9
11 August 1998,"Predictable, but entertaining","This movie has a very simple and predictable plot, but the performances and characters save the movie. The characters talk about their lives, make jokes, give advice to each other, stand up for each other, and have fun. The witty screenplay, and the characters are what make the movie entertaining.

13 February 2009,A gay's view on a beautiful boy,"Actually Good Will Hunting is one of my so-called favorite movies, about it I have too much to say, which makes me speechless every time I wanna say something about it. I love it so much and have seen it for more than 10 times. Recently I found something really interesting in this movie, which is, apart from those main ideas, also remarkable.

We know Gus Van Sant is a gay and enjoyed filming gays in his early days, after which more and more people got to know and like him and he made quite a few great films not about gays. But apparently from those ""straight"" movies we can still see his preference. In Good Will Hunting, we see, from Sant's eyes, Matt as a pretty beautiful boy, eyes reflected by the mirror when writing on it carefully; sitting in the bus alone and looking outside the window thinking about his life; reading big books every night before sleeping in his small room; talking with Sean by the river looking at him while he's talking, shocked speechless... These all seem to me to be a gay director's view on a beautiful boy, not another boy's view, not a man's view, not a girl's view either. But don't get me wrong, it's never evil; on the contrary, it's beautiful.",10
22 April 2001,This ain't bad at all!!,"It's an alright film, I think. I was amuzed, entertained and moved. So who cares it's kinda been done before. The actors are great, the music is brilliant, and hey! If you look close you might even find a little lesson for life.

9's the vote. What a little charmer indeed.

7 May 2003,Brainless romance of brilliance-by-numbers,"The intellectual endeavour that is pure mathematics gets mopped-up, in this film, about as mechanically as the floors our janitor-hero swabs in the College where he works: He idly solves a conundrum left by a professor in order to test the ability of his undergraduate class to their limits.

Our hero can't take anything seriously, though, - least of all an ability that should command any number of excellent, albeit not necessarily academic, occupations - because of an abused childhood. He seems an unlikely combination of colossal arrogance and extremely low self-esteem. This does at least lead to a glorious put-down of some dim rich kid who is nerdily annoying a girl. This is easily the best scene in the movie. The pay-off, when he exhibits the trophy of her 'phone number to the bested contender, saying, 'How d'ye like them apples?' sets up a likeable, if difficult, underdog whom we really want to get to understand.

Unfortunately, this was the only good scene. The intriguing personality of a lad with enormous ability, but a wayward character born of social deprivation, and his anticipated moral struggle to control his mental endowments, is never developed. To put it another way, his character was

never properly conceived and identified in the first place, and so can never be shown developing out of the contradictions of his creator's original confusion.

Part of the problem is that the film half-wants to be another florid paean to the Romance of Learning, along the lines of 'Dead Poet Society'. The presence of Robin Williams - thinly-disguised under a pair of cartoon-shoulders that could only have come out of Popeye's spinach-tin - keeps reminding us of the inspiring teacher he was in that much more reflective (if imperfect) work. But the teacher in 'GWH' is a bland cipher. We shall see that this hopelessly scuppers the film.

In 'GWH' the acquisition of knowledge is presented consistently as being no more than a superior party-trick, the accidental product of a photographic memory. Or even as some virile clash of champions. We see this most absurdly in such scenes as that of the dismissal of the 'great mathematician', after he has been effortlessly bested in the solving of an even bigger and nastier mathematical conundrum, by our young turk: This obviously shattered individual reels off to recover from the mental devastation of being so utterly routed. Presumably he will end his days like some punch-drunk boxer, doing menial tasks, such as mopping the floor, perhaps, - now totally unfitted to draw his inflated salary as a star academic! Or this absurd shoot-out of ten-gallon brains might put us in mind of the baddy in some Wild West circus turn, humbled by the white-hatted radiance of the heroic cypher! There is certainly no inkling, here, of the collegiate pursuit of knowledge. There is no dawning engagement with the wider, grown-up world. There are no shadings. There is no reflection. There is not a particle of reality.

This is mere intellectual philistinism and immaturity. As bildungsromane, this film is the equivalent of the 'Rocky' fight stories. The character's development is told purely in all-American terms of adolescent virility - he is, and remains, a 'regular guy' who is true to the common experience of an intended audience of equally immature peers. His actions are authentically animal, at least, while, on the other hand, his thoughts are nothing more than pure automatism, bereft of the intellectual effort that would only pollute the blond beast so beloved of Americans, handicapped as they often seem to be by a profoundly insecure self-image. It is in order to reform, not his thinking - which is completely incidental to this drama - , but his social behaviour, that he is being granted the boon (as here it appears, rather than as the right!) of education. His therapy is political, intended to indoctrinate him into conformity with general social mores. It does nothing to render him a fit candidate for a higher degree.This alarming, if unconscious, exposure of this creepily conformist agenda, that is at the heart of America's bone-headed populism, is perhaps the only factor making this film worth consideration at all. As a source of sociological reflection on our great neighbour, it is quite alarming to observe herein how readily American youth appears to subscribe to its own enfeeblement.

What a devil's bargain is offered our Everyman of America: Self-realisation through Education - but only, and expressly, through the Trial of Therapy, that uniquely American tool of totalitarian thought-control. It is as if we are being given a re-make of 'A Clockwork Orange', in which we are unblinkingly asked to applaud the perversion of the unruly but human potential of Alex into the bland, neutered and utterly soulless citizen of a society of the like-mindless. This is what 'GWH' implies, by its deliberate confusion of education with therapy. Where 'Dead Poet' inspires (albeit in a rather 'Reader's Digest' fashion), 'GWH' prescribes. The pervading niceness that comes over our bright bad boy is every bit as creepy as 'Clockwork Orange''s brainwashing scenes - more so, since the picture seems blithely untroubled by this perversion of true, organic character development.

Even the more wayward knights of King Arthur's Round Table were expected to actually study discipline, and team-work, and to understand why they should submit to the judgement of their intellectual peers. Even the mad fantasist of Robin Williams' 'Dosser King', in Terry Gilliam's Arthurian subversion of all-American values, demands submission to his testing discipline only in order to restore Jeff Bridges' character, whole, to himself. Nowhere in the juvenile film at issue is the getting of wisdom represented as what it must be, even for the brightest students: 1% inspiration, and 99% perspiration. But the American way - the Hollywood way, at least, - to self-realisation is to overdose on emotionalism, as apparently only pure sensation can lead Americans to the true goal of all human fulfillment. Mathematics is not even a witty McGuffin in such a childish formula. And the sprinkling of other cultural references provides no more than high-toned decoration - an impatient short-hand for the engagement with serious and difficult cultural issues, which are entirely absent from the pretentious, adolescent, Ed Wood-scale of artistic self-delusion on display.

Hence the spreading soft-focus of the film, after the first few establishing scenes, and the increasing redundancy of a plot that was never honestly posited on intellectual endeavour at all.

So: Just another Hollywood fairy-tale, without any of that haunted, grown-up sense of darkness that makes a film like Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' such a powerful fable of the human soul.

A superficial, brainless teen romance of brilliance-by-numbers.",
7 February 2013,Good Will Hunting '97,"Highlight: Nominated for 9 Oscars and won two Oscars that includes Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (Robin Williams) and Best Screenplay (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) Good Will Hunting proved to be a rise to Stardom for Matt Damon

This is an intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT where he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department. Though the story is a bit far stretched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man. Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT. This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy. He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing. The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale. The cast is well-assembled with Matt Damon delivering a fine performance which snagged him his only Oscar nomination till date. Minnie Driver, as Will's love interest, also landed out with an Oscar nomination. Robin Williams won his first Oscar for his role after three previous nominations. The rest of the cast is solid, particularly the under-appreciated Stellan Skarsg√•rd The story is interesting and quite entertaining .The comedy is done well and placed well throughout the film. I do have a complaint about the film that is the absurd amount of swearing in the film. I agree that sometimes it is necessary, but there is a truly unnecessary amount of language in the film. But please, don't let that discourage you from seeing the film; it is a great film to watch. Overall, ""Good Will Hunting"", despite the incredibly precious title, is worthwhile a film. Fine performances and a compelling (Oscar-winning) script combine to produce a memorable film that should be fondly remembered for years to come.

My Rating - 8/10",8
4 October 1999,Blastphamy,"Alright most of you who probably commented on it were probably older people. This is a bitchin movie. Hell I cried ME. The acting is great it is fabulous. This really is a a tear jerker. Will Hunting is a miraculous person and with his performance mixed with that of Robin Williams it makes it seem real. It is an instant winner and everyone should see it.

9.5/10 Second only too Shaw Shank.

2 August 2006,"Perfect Screenplay, Wonderful Acting, A Truly Great Story!","Matt Damon and Ben Afleck wrote the screenplay for ""Good Will Hunting""; they got Oscars for it. For once, I totally agree with the Oscar-Granting Committee, or whatever it's called.

Stellan Skarsgard, Minnie Driver, Robin Williams and Afleck himself put in superb supporting roles. Good for Ben, subordinating himself to Matt that way; Matt was simply stunning in his lead role.

I lived for about 18 years in the Boston area. I loved the true-to-life setting it made for this film.

THIS IS, SIMPLY, A TRULY GREAT FILM! See it. Buy it. See it again and again...

11 August 2021,Thinking abt this movie still.,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9

10 April 2002,Don't like swearing? Make an acception for this one.,"Some people here have commented on why the characters in this wonderful picture swear so much. They believe that it's unnecessary and takes away from the movie. But they are wrong. The cussing in this movie is only part of their background. It shows the imperfections in them, and their words are backed up by their actions.That's all there is to it.

Now to the movie itself. This is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Matt Damon did a marvelous job of playing the flawed but gifted Will Hunting. Will is flawed in that he pushes people away, he doesn't allow himself to become emotionally attached to anyone. Where he is gifted is in his extraordinary mind. He and Minnie Driver have great chemistry, and both are able to take complete control of their characters and play them to the fullest. Will is a complex character that will keep you entertained the whole movie, and in my opinion, I believe that Damon is a much better actor than Affleck. Too bad he has not gotten the attention he is worthy of.

Besides the excellent performance by Damon, Robin Williams has also proved his ability to play completely different characters, and seemingly with out much difficulty. Before watching this movie, I thought Williams would continue to remain in childhood films such as Hook and Jack. Characters that were always happy in a way. In this movie, however, he plays the troubled therapist, Sean Maguire, a person still grieving over the loss of his wife to cancer. The scenes with Damon and Williams light up on screen, for both of these characters need each other in order to move on. You'll understand when you see the movie. Williams deserved the Oscar he got for portraying Maguire.

Is there a lot of swearing? Yes there is. But who cares? After seeing a movie like this, you'll have a feeling that these people are no longer trying to waste their lives, but move forward. I highly recommend this movie. Enjoy!

19 December 2005,A magnificent tale of human bonding.,"Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a twenty year old delinquent working a dead end job as a university janitor. But Will has an extraordinary gift, he is a genius, able to rework mathematic theories and equations at the drop of a hat. With no family, he spends most of his time hanging with his best friend Chucky (Ben Affleck) and others, wasting his talents in order to get drunk and cause problems.

His talents are picked up however by a university professor who takes Will on as a prot√©g√© in order to keep him out of prison, but Will must also seek help from a psychiatrist. After numerous failed attempts Will is put on Sean, a shirnk with his own deep problems, mourning the loss of his beloved wife.

Will falls for Skylar, a beautiful girl studying Maths. But things don't go smoothly in their relationship as she finds out about Will's past and how scared he is of getting close to people. Will has a journey to make, one that will take him through his past and re-invent him with the help of his friends and his shrink.

The film deserves all the praise it got. The screenplay by Damon and Affleck is simply nothing short of stunning, with more than believable characters and situations. The dialogue is snappy, warming, harsh and fun all at the same time.

Robin William's excels as Damon's shrink, taking the role by both hands and really bringing out his character that is fun, down to earth and also suffering from his own trauma. Because of this he and Will feed off one another, each learning something new about their own personality.

Gus Van Sant's directing is as practical as it needs to be. No funky camera shots, no gimmicks, just straight into the action, telling the story, and that what makes a film truly great.

If your type of film has to involve gun fights and loose women then steer clear, but if you are looking for a heart warming story that will touch you and perhaps make you look at your own life, then look no further, because Good Will Hunting is simply nothing short of genius.",9
31 May 1999,Hunting is a believable character,"I did not think this movie was great, but I did like it. However, I do not feel the characters in this movie are unrealistic, as some have complained. I felt the character of Will Hunting, who seems to be the most maligned, was very real. Maybe the problem is that people have gotten so used to seeing characters who are one-dimensional and non-contradictory, even though this is not what people are like in real life. Will Hunting is a mathematical genius, but this in no way means that he should behave intelligently in all domains of his life. Hence, it is not unrealistic for him to behave stupidly when it comes to women. Nor is it unrealistic for him to work as a janitor. In my experience, people often do things that could not be predicted from their intelligence or abilities alone. I myself have done things that I intellectually knew were stupid or detrimental; I'm sure most people have, and a mathematical genius should be no exception. The character of Hunting struck me very much as a guy who has a problem with sabotaging his own happiness and success, maybe out of fear of greater failure should he put himself on the line. His amazing abilities do not necessitate that he have a good job and a university degree, because it is not just intelligence that determines these things. In school, perhaps he skipped all his classes and never did his assignments, and thus got poor grades. That being the case, he would not have been accepted to a prestigious university, and in fact no one might have noticed his affinity for math. It is also possible he simply didn't apply to university, even though he might have been accepted, either to stay with his friends or to prevent academic failure. I think one of the points of this movie is that being gifted does not by itself make you happy and successful. Being gifted does not make you immune to psychological problems, or make you behave in an intelligent manner in all situations. If his character had been written this way- well, first off, there wouldn't be a movie. Secondly, that would have made his character completely unbelievable. I do concede that the likelihood of a genius being a janitor is not that great, but it is not impossible, and I'm sure it happens. There are historical figures that we now recognise as great, even though in their time they were ignored or ridiculed for their beliefs. There are also nutty geniuses, who cut off their ears and what not. In light of such things and of my own personal experiences, I don't see any reason why Hunting can't be as screwed up as the rest of us.",

29 June 2023,This is not my fault.,"Experience did not bury my talent, but it wiped out the confidence I deserved. I was frightened and grew into a arrogance. I relied on this way to protect myself, finally waiting for a sentence: This is not my fault.

You are young and tough. If I were to talk about war with you, you could throw Shakespeare at me and recite 'Together to the battlefield, dear friend'. But you have never personally been to the battle, never tried to hold your best friend's head in your arms, watching him take his last breath, staring at you, asking for help. Don't think I understand you. Perhaps I can see you through 'knowledge', but that's not you. Unless you're willing to talk about yourself, I don't know who you really are.

28 August 2023,Best picture of 1997,"Even though this film is a slow burner and usually I don't enjoy these type of films as I have a heard time engaging with them I have to say this film was something. The slow burner was purposefully done. The film has a great and interesting storyline and to top that a well written and intelligent script. This is probably one of the strong assets to this film because even though it's slow, it's gripping and engaging I honestly didn't even see the two hours passing. I also have to say Gus Van Sant did a really good job directing this film. Another strong point about this film is probably the acting. Matt Damon and Robin Williams gave amazing and solid performances and were really convincing. I even cried at the end of the film just goes to show how moving this film was. Its a 10/10 for me.

20 January 2022,only here for robin williams lol,"Good Will Hunting is a pretty good coming-of-age movie. It's about the man, Will, who has a genius-level IQ and he worked at MIT as a janitor. The math professor discovered his talent and wanted to help him to achieve his success. When Will was arrested, the professor made a deal that Will would work with him as he get therapy. Overall, the movie has good psychological thinking and it talks about certain heavy topics. There are some plot holes and the fighting scenes, in the beginning, aren't executed well. However, I love Robin Williams' acting.

29 January 2012,"""Nobody's Perfect, Sport. The Question Is, Whether or Not You're Perfect For Each Other...""","Gus Van Sant (mostly because we share the same hometown of Portland, Oregon) has always been one of the filmmakers I have paid attention to. I never give him undue bias, because he can definitely be hit or miss. This, however, was and always will be, his biggest hit (in terms of making an ideal film). There are hundreds of quotable lines in here that espouse more philosophy than most filmmakers pack into trilogies. The direction is steady and the acting is great, but what really sets this movie apart is the writing. The writing of Good Will Hunting is so exquisitely realistic and philosophical, that to contemplate your own life during the movie is almost a necessity. There is not a whole lot of emotional manipulation in the movie, it is basically just such a universal story, that to be unemotional would be callous.

Similar to the quote in the title, delivered by Robin Williams in his best role, this movie isn't perfect, but no movie is...the question is whether or not it is the perfect movie for you. It doesn't matter if I watch another ten thousand movies, this movie will always be in my top 20.",10
24 November 1998,"a good movie, but hype unjustified","While I enjoyed this movie, I think all the hype was unjustified. Matt Damon was somehow unconvincing in this role, though he is an extremely talented actor (perhaps this is due to the unbelievable plot). Robin Williams' performance as the troubled psychiatrist was nothing short of brilliant, and to me, was the best (and most underrated) thing about this movie. The movie did not engage my emotions as I believe it should have. I could not help thinking how hard it seemed to try to be a cross between ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Ordinary People,"" and as a result proved inferior to both. Also features a memorable performance by Skellan (sorry, forgot the last name!) as a mathematics professor but I did not care for the annoying Minnie Driver as Damon's love interest. The ending was also somehow unsatisfying. Did ""Will"" ever make anything of himself or not? One wonders...

22 February 2001,Some Movies Strike Gold!,"Once in awhile a movie comes along that truly is special. What makes a movie special? Is it the ""special"" effects? Not usually. For me, I want a movie with exceptional acting, a good story, a tight screenplay, and creative directing. But, above all else I want good old fashioned wonderfully written dialogue between believable characters that I can relate to and learn from. This is what I think separates descent movies from the really special ones. This is what enables me to really submerge myself into the story. Everyone has certain movies that they can watch over and over and never get tired of. Good Will Hunting is one of those movies that I find to get better each time I watch it.

This movie is filled with fabulous stimulating dialogue between interesting, yet real-to-life characters. Matt Damon gives one of my favorite performances on film to date. He portrays Will Hunting, a genius whose tough on the outside but scared on the inside personality will keep him from finding true happiness or realizing his full potential until he is able to escape his past and learn how to trust again. Robin Williams also gives an outstanding performance as the shrink who tries to help him do that, and learns a little bit about life himself. If you just took the scenes between these two characters to make this movie it would have still been excellent. But this movie has so much more to offer. There is the relationship with Skylar, played by Minnie Driver who has everything Will has ever looked for in a girl. There are his buddies who he has grown up with his whole life, including his best friend Chuckie, played by Ben Affleck. There is Professor Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, who is one of the smartest mathematicians in the world, and yet his knowledge and ability does not even compare to young Will Hunting.

All of this adds up to one of the most entertaining and thought provoking movies out there. There are life lessons to be learned and cinematic brilliance to be enjoyed with this one. One of the best ever!",10
13 September 2003,Here I have explained the underlying ideas behind the movie (SPOILERS).,"This movie, like many others, has one or two characteristics that are quite questionable, but at the same time understandable. One of which is the possible impression that Hollywood intended to sell themselves to the general audience by taking the idea of a genius who does the unbelievable act of being cool... ""Oh my, look at that! He's just as smart as Steve Urkel (another fictional genius) but he is like, so cool."" If that was your take on the movie why should it be? This is where you went wrong, you compared Will Hunting to some stereotypical view of the genius. Does Will Hunting set a good example? Definitely not! He is a gigantic loser, but the message behind the movie is simple: ""No matter who you are or how intelligent, we always need to look to our fellow human beings (i.e. each other) for wisdom and guidance."" The movie is incredibly accurate in demonstrating how it is very possible for a genius of any caliber to lack wisdom. The movie is also heart-warming and easily delivers bundles of ""goodness"". Look at the way the movie concludes itself... with Robin Williams reading Will's letter saying,

""Dear Shawn,

If the professor calls about that job,

tell him sorry,

I had to go see about a girl,

Will.""

Shawn looks up again, ""Son of a bitch... he stole my line...""

Scene changes to an empty highway with a beat-up old car driving on and on, inside steers Will, one of the greatest geniuses the world has ever seen, and although he has not quite gotten anywhere great in life, all the helping hands and friendships paid off, and there he is on his way to something better...

The genius is the closest any human being can get to determining actions and decisions almost always without flaw, this movie united the genius with the unfortunate human beings you might see on the sidewalk when you take a stroll downtown.

You can see how during the middle, before the climax of Will losing his ability to keep things inside, that one by one he loses those people who are his world and yet one by one, he shrugs off any care he has for each loss. First, Skylar, then, the Professor, then Chuckie (not really loses) who tells him basically, ""I don't really want you to be around..."" this comes as a shock to Will, since he always though that if he loses someone new in his life, like Skylar, he can always fall back on his best friend...and then finally Shawn, who gives Will the idea that he had enough of his 'shit' because Will spoke to Shawn with very little respect after everyone else who was important dropped from his life as if like flies. ""Look at me Shawn, what the hell is the point? I lost everyone important to me, all of our sessions were a waste anyway, I might as well show you that I'm nobody you should be trying to help, so I'll test you to...""

I think my explanation in the ""A Beautiful Mind"" forum would help you understand what makes one genius behave a certain way, and another almost the complete opposite. I mean Will Hunting is on the opposite end of the personality pole to John Nash (a non-fictional genius) and Steve Urkel.",
21 July 2015,Great story and performances all around,"I seriously love this movie. It is a amazing movie.

The story is original and great. The acting is great, it sucks me in everything I watch the movie. The camera work is great and the movie has some great shots.

Good Will Hunting is definitely a feel good movie, you just can't help having a smile on your face at the end of the movie. The movie is amazing.

I watched it again for Robin Williams and his performance is great, it makes me sad every time I see his face on screen and that just adds to his performance.

19 February 2001,Average,"Mediocre and predictable. A few well written scenes but otherwise hackneyed. Robin Williams performance is very strong; stronger than the rest of the cast. The main letdown is the plot's predictablity. A fair first effort but not worthy of the praise heaped upon it.

23 November 2018,Life altering experience,"This is by far the best movie I have or will ever see. It has changed my outlook on life and has led me to see things from a different perspective. Thank you Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for such a wonderfully insightful script. And to those who think Robin Williams gets typecasted as a comedian, please watch this movie. One of the best performances I have ever seen. Hats off! Must have seen it over 50 times.

5 September 2021,Arresting plot,"I must say, from the start of this one, I had my doubts. And then it picked up soon enough. Will Hunting was barely likeable at first, but by the last few scenes I found myself rooting for him. Although not without its (insignificant) flaws, this movie had a decent plot and by the end of it, I found it a rewarding watch.

Verdict: Gripping slow-burner.

23 March 2000,Luke Nan really liked it,"I have a friend, Luke Nan, who would have to be GWH #1 fan. He watches it at least once a week, and keeps telling me how it was robbed of the academy award. I have to settle him down because he feels so strongly about it, but I agree that it's a pretty good flick. The main thing he raves about is Matt Damon's performance. He's not to good on the internet so he asked me to put something on Good Will Hunting in his name on the net. So here it is- Luke Nan loves Good Will Hunting. Thankyou for making a diehard fan's wish come true.

13 September 1998,Matt Damon proves how versatile an actor he is,"Damon carries this thing all the way, which is good because after all he plays the title character. I watched ""The Rainmaker"" just before watching ""Good Will Hunting"" and I was blown away by the contrast of Damon's characters and the versatility of his acting. First of all his southern drawl and Boston accent are wonderfully authentic. This is important to the viewer who has to believe in the character. Robin Williams would have been more believable if he'd have stuck with his own accent rather than attempting to muddle through one of the worst ""Baastan"" accents I've heard. It's distracting listening to him go in and out of it. This is the only downer in an otherwise brilliant performance; his best serious role since ""Awakenings,"" which was a far better performance. Far too little attention has been paid to Stellan Skarsgard's performance. He is wonderful in his role as the domineering math professor attempting to take Will under his wing. Skarsgard's dialogue with both Williams and Damon creates some of the more memorable scenes in the movie. Other great performances include Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Casey Affleck. I'd like to include Cole Hauser as Bill in this list, but he barely has three lines in the whole movie. Over all this film is entertaining, funny, and original. It's refreshing.

19 February 2023,"""Good Will Hunting"" put both Affleck and Damon on the map","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",
29 November 2001,"I like them apples just fine, thank you!","When I saw this film at the movies, my friends and I were all set to see some film about a giant boat sinking and tragic love, blah blah. Lucky for us, the seats were all taken for that one, and so we agreed on Good Will Hunting, with all but one of us not knowing who these Damon & Affleck people were.

This theater was also filled up (to start with anyway). Let me say to anyone reading this that I live in the buckle of the Bible Belt. That being said, the first 10 minutes or so of this film saw a gradual emptying of the seats, with many a disgusted snort from my fellow moviegoers. The so-constant-it-was-mind-altering barrage of the ""F"" word was hard to take at first. Not that we'd never heard it before, but it being used so carelessly and often was shocking. However, being too cheap to try and buy tickets for a later showing of Titanic and too chicken to ask for our money back, we endured. After my head stopped swimming & I refocused, I was really genuinely glad we stayed.

As aforementioned, this was the first I'd heard of Matt Damon or Ben Affleck. I found both of these young men to be excellent actors and they have proven that many times since this film. The fact that they wrote this screenplay and saw it through to production and were able to star in it is pretty amazing also. My favorite part of this movie had to be the scenes between Mr. Damon's character and that of Robin Williams. Robin Williams is simply divine, in my humble opinion he is almost without equal in his chosen profession. He and Mr. Damon moved us all to both laughter and tears. Each actor cast in this film played their parts with excellence. Good Will Hunting is superbly written, fantastically well acted, directed and the cinematography was wonderful also. The cursing, in retrospect, was really part of the vehicle that gave you a sense of place in the film. I've since learned (from a native of the Boston area) that this is the way certain groups of folks from around there commonly speak. I hope you will excuse our ignorance here below the Mason-Dixon line. If you are from the South and were warned away - don't be afraid, this really is a mighty fine f**kin' film!!",10
8 November 2002,"Write movies with your bestbuddy, it works.","Good Will Hunting is the story of a janitor who is really smart. If I just told you the plot of Good Will Hunting you would probably fall asleep but this is an amazing movie, a true testament to the secret of brilliant film making which is teamwork. Two best buds write a film about where they are from -They cast each other, their friends, family and current girlfriends (down to the extras)- They also get a great director and Robin Williams - Vision,Support & improv ensues. Oscars are won.

If you are looking for a well acted, lovingly crafted, rewindable movie - By george! I think you've found one. It may even get you thinkin' about life, your role in it, and what's important - but you definitely won't be sleeping through this movie. Yes the story could be considered cliche' but when the cliche' is served to you so well you have to admit you like them apples.

(just couldn't resist the 'apple' reference - see how the movie can influence : )

21 November 2011,Outstanding!!!!!!,"This is a film of character a film that got everything right. It was the story of a super mouse. Someone smarterÔªø than everyone else, but from that he had a curse. That curse was that he couldn't forget the problems of his life. The shrink the girlfriend the friends and everyone else made him realize how great he truly is.This movie is truly a film of immense character. This is a film whereÔªø you see the good nature of humans that appears of the outside yet the genius and seriousness in the inside.This is one of those films that youÔªø watch because nothing better is on and it turns out to be one of your favorite movies! RobinÔªø Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck & Minnie Driver are outstanding in it.The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.Once youÔªø watch it for the first time, you will appreciate that such great inspirational movies still exist.

21 June 2012,Pure Genius,"I'm not a fan of the bad language, but I love this movie. The acting is so great!! Robin Williams is a hilarious comedian, but also is one of the greatest actors I have ever watched. He delivers such a great role in this, and his long monologue at the park is so moving. I memorized Robin's Williams park monologue and filmed myself saying it because its so good. Matt Damon also did an incredible job in this movie, he played such a jerk of a person, but later on you were able to understand more of why he was such a jerk. I have seen this movie 5 times and I love it the same every time I watch it!!!! The is a great movie and worth the watch only if you are not offended by such bad language. The bad language is a huge turn-off to watch movies like this, which sucks. But this is a great movie and well-deserved those Oscars.

24 March 2000,"""YOU`RE SITTING ON A WINNING LOTTERY TICKET""","When Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this movie they didn`t know they were ""sitting on a winning lottery ticket"" but they had a good feeling it was!! Thank God they were`nt to wimpy ""to cash it in"" because this is a great movie. To many movies come out that just don`t have what GWH has. Although i can`t call it a classic (mainly because their is to much profanity in it), the movie is still worth seeing atleast 2 or 3 times. The language problem is most likely the reason this film didn`t win an academy award for best picture. Despite this flaw in the movie it`s still one of the best films of the 90`s. I know they were trying to make it more like real life with the swearing but not even construction workers and sailors put together swear that much. If you can get passed this part of the movie you will find a great film that has excellent acting and a fantastic story that you don`t see in alot of movies out their. rating (best of 5 stars) .....4.....

14 January 2007,Good Will Hunting is still as good as it was 10 years ago...,"A few months ago I rented Good Will Hunting from a rental store right next door to me. I must say I know it came out almost 10 years ago, it is still amazing. The story was brilliant, the cast amazing, Robin Williams, who won an academy award for this, Matt Damon, who got nominated for this, Ben Affleck, and Minnie Driver, also getting nominated for this. I feel that this movie got robbed big time at the academy awards, but it did have the bad luck of coming out in the same year as titanic, l.a. confidential, and as good as it gets. I just bought this today over at best buy and it was still amazing as the first time i saw it. Loaded with a lot of comic relief. Definalty worth a rental and worth a buy as well.

6 December 1999,This movie is O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D,"Sorry, but my heart has failed to be warmed by this plotless film class exercise. Supposedly, this is a powerful story of a man with inner demons (child abuse) who meets his match with a therapist with a similar story, blah blah blah. What it really is is a Lifetime movie dressed up with some fancy cinematography. I gave it a 5/10 because it's not bad...but it sure ain't good.

If you want to see a movie about a poor, smart, troublemaking boy who straightens up after he falls in love with a rich girl, you'd get a much better film in ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Aladdin.""

10 July 2023,Emphasis on good,"This is a good movie that shows a message that it's not too late for messed up people to change, and that many problems we associate with people aren't as clear cut as they seem. Will Hunting is a good protagonist who has a very difficult life with few people understanding him and being in a spot that feels like there's nowhere else to go. As a neurological person myself I found Will to be somewhat relatable. I had a good uprising but I've seen so many others fall down this hole of uncertainty and sadness. Matt Damon and Robin Williams were just amazing in this movie and did a great job.

For those who haven't seen it, there is a TON of f-words, just a heads up. And honestly this is probably my biggest criticism. I get that this is mainly to show how hard of a life Will has it, but it ruins the stakes and climaxes of the movie. How can I get invested in the emotional parts of the story if it just feels the same as the rest of the movie? A little slow at times and Will's character isn't the greatest from a realistic point of view but I appreciate the work put into it and the message we can get from it.",8
21 November 2018,Standing the test of time.,"I had my 15 yr old girls watch it with me last month. They loves it so much that they requested to see it again! Beautifully written and acted! Robin Williams' genius is elevating the story even further. Yiu must see this film if you haven't, and if you have,watch it again!

18 March 2006,"With A Stroke Of Good Will, Unknown Matt Damon Becomes A Star","""Good Will Hunting"" is a movie about a young man from the south side of Boston, the rough and tumble neighborhood of Southee, who is having tremendous difficulty coping in the adult world. He is reaching his twenty-first birthday and the age when he is no longer a ward of the state. The question is can he conquer his demons, grow into adulthood and be a contributing member of society.

Will Hunting (Matt Damon), an orphan approaching adulthood, has moved in and out of several foster homes as a child, and has had several run-ins with the law. But he is also a genius, who can solve math problems on the level of Euclid and Pythagorous. The only question is: In which direction will he turn? Will he stay with his street-wise gang of friends? Or will he grow up, start looking for a career job, and start taking some responsibility for his own predicament? Will Hunting is cocky, belligerent, and downright nasty at times until he finally meets his match with Dr. Sean McGuire, (Robin Williams). McGuire talks Will's language, sports, sex, and even profanity to try to get inside the boy's head, to see what's really bothering him.

Comic relief plays a large part in the movie. In one scene, Will accuses his first therapist of being gay and making a pass at him, sexually. Also at a local bar, Will is trying to protect a friend from getting humiliated, and gets into an argument about colonial imperialism with a smart aleck. This bar scene is also very enlightening.

""Good Will Hunting"" is the movie that made Matt Damon a star. Matt Damon, along with good friend Ben Affleck won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Robin Williams won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.",7
23 December 1999,I guess it makes gen-x think they're hip to like this loser,"After watching this on tape, I did not see the reason why people like this film. The premise that Matt and Ben were poor kids was not believable. The plot was divided into three parts which were barely connected and the part with Minnie Driver was unnecessary and must have been added so that people would see it as a ""Chick"" flick.

The profanity was unnecessary and excessive, the producers and directors must never have actually set foot on a college campus.

3 June 2002,Beautiful Movie,"Very rarely does a movie stand out like this one. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's story is so beautiful that you experience every type of emotion throughout the film.

Robin Williams deserved the Oscar for his performance and it's sad that people often forget that when he does a serious film - he's brilliant. He doesn't showcase that other side of him often enough and he's probably the only actor besides Bruce Willis who can play every type of character imaginable.

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were brilliant as well and deserved more recognition at the Oscars other than the win for the screenplay.

I am not a fan of Minnie Driver but her performance is haunting and she really put all her heart and soul into this role.

If you haven't seen this movie you don't know what you are missing.

26 March 2018,Good Will Hunting Stands as a Model on How to do a Low-Budget Film Right,"Good Will Hunting's plot follows troubled custodian Will Hunting (Matt Damon) as he tries to navigate relationships and life in 1997 Boston and Cambridge. Throughout the 126 minute film, Will's ego and psyche are challenged by the weathered Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) while finding something inside of himself he did not know he had with Skylar (Minnie Driver). This excellent and complex plot coupled with the outstanding music from the late Elliot Smith create an unforgettable atmosphere from start to finish.

The screenplay finds a precise balance between distress and happiness which gives the film a unique footprint for future scripts to follow. The script is penned by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who also has a role in the film. During the writing stage of the production Gus Van Sant- the director of the film- visited Damon and Affleck frequently and later critiqued their writing method in the Introduction to the published screenplay: ""Ben and Matt would fly into action and create something almost spontaneously with Matt standing in the middle of the hotel room demonstratively gesturing and editing ideas by drawing dotted lines in the air with his hands, with Ben writing down dialogue on his laptop computer."" This spontaneous yet structured dialogue can be seen throughout the film, excellently mastered by the acting chops of Robin Williams and film royalty Stellan Skarsg√•rd.

Robin Williams delivers a more controlled and stable character as opposed to his mostly zany and comical repertoire. His character arguably grows as much as the main protagonist throughout the film as he needs to open up in order to mentor Will Hunting. In the famous ""pond scene"" Williams delivers- in my opinion- one of the greatest film monologues of all time, creating a father-figure character in less than five minutes. However, Williams does not waste a chance to shine in comedy during a completely improvised scene about two thirds through the film.

Independent films today have grown to focus more on art than narrative, which lowers the quality of the film. When there is little-to-no narrative in your film, there is nothing for your audience to connect with. An example of this problem in more modern cinema is the film The Mountain Between Us. While the film captures awe-inspiring landscapes, the dialogue and narrative is so poor it is hard to feel any sort of connection with the characters whatsoever. For reasons and examples like these, this is why I believe that Good Will Hunting stands as a model on how to do a low-budget film right.",10
9 August 2023,Unveiling the Depths of Brilliance: Good Will Hunting,"""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) emerges as a timeless masterpiece, a cinematic gem that captivates not only upon the first viewing but also beckons for repeated encounters. The film's profound narrative unravels the complexities of a janitor, Will Hunting, whose prodigious mathematical talents remain hidden beneath a facade of defiance. The true essence of the story, however, lies in the transformative power of connection and mentorship. As Will forms an unlikely bond with a psychologist, their interactions spark an intellectual and emotional journey that transcends his circumstances. Anchored by Robin Williams' poignant portrayal, the film delves deep into themes of self-discovery, resilience, and the redemptive force of human connections. ""Good Will Hunting"" is not merely a film; it's an exploration of the human psyche and an enduring reminder that our greatest triumphs often stem from the battles we wage within ourselves.

6 January 2012,somehow it works,"Good Will Hunting is an improbable film about a young man with an unbelievable IQ and gift for mathematics. Set in Boston, Mass, it deals will many issues that I found prevalent in that city when I was growing up 40 years ago. Everyone, rich or poor, wants to be ""smaaart"" in Boston. No one wants to be a ""fucking moron"". So, here you have everyone's secret fantasy brought to life, especially if you are a ""southie"" from the poor part of town. And that fantasy is to be able to outsmart the MIT and Harvard boys. Will Hunting does just that, and the fact that he is a janitor at esteemed MIT only serves to further illustrate the class conflicts that only his prodigious talent can penetrate and overcome.

Now I think that many people watching this film did not find Will's character to be believable. But Will is first of all a Boston native and so I believe that the movie is somewhat autobiographical or at least the expression of a fantasy of his. This makes the movie work for me as he is able to be himself with all of its contradictions - angry and foul mouthed but also smart and wanting the world to know it. He embodies well the Boston I remember with all of its class tensions. Intellectuals hold a place of great respect there, but they also can be resented and envied. That resentment is what fuels Will's ambition and gives the movie a sense of believability. Could this happen in real life? - sure, but only if the gift is toned down somewhat. Yeah, but thats Hollywood and you have to expect that his talent would be trumped up a bit.

Anyway, so I enjoyed this movie on many levels. In particular I loved Minnie Driver and believe that without her, things could have fallen apart very easily. I don't think her relationship with Will was awkward or forced. Smart girls often fall for less fortunate guys. This was one of the more satisfying relationships in a movie I have seen in quite a while. And Robin Williams puts in a strong performance although if you are from Boston you know he's no southie. He is, though, a little like Popeye the sailor man - still a force to be reckoned with. Did he and Will have to bond over fart humor though? Seems they could have worked on that a bit...

But Good Will hunting is overall a well written, thought provoking drama that explores a lot of issues and relationships surrounding class, career ambitions, personal triumph and tragedy. No one escapes unharmed and there are no gods in the end. The fortunate are humbled, and Will can never escape his past. This is Boston. Here we end up with a compromise of sorts where several individuals from completely different backgrounds teach each other a few things about life and grow as a result. Now if you had told me the storyline before I saw the movie, I would have been dubious that it could work. But because you had two up and coming, talented individuals writing and acting from the heart, a sensitive director, some good music and nice city shots, this is a movie I would watch again for sure. Two thumbs up.",
22 February 1999,Good Film,"Good Will Hunting is a very special film to me. The thing I love about this film is the relationship factor, the way relationships develop throughout the film - between Will and Sean, Will and Skylar, Will and Chuckie. I also like the way we see Will grow through the film and especially the way Sean and Will overcome their grief together. I thought Minnie Driver was illuminous throughout the film, Damon was excellent as Will, and Robin Williams deserved his Oscar. The film made me cry a lot as well.

26 March 2001,Good film made even better by great acting and a phenomenal script,"Yes, the genre of the troubled genius given guidance in the finer aspects of life is a cliche. Yes, it's somewhat predictable. And yes, there's a lot of cursing. However, all the other elements in Good Will Hunting help the film not only succeed, but soar.

The script Good Will Hunting is the antithesis to the Hollywood system as we know it: Two talented young actors, yet to make their big break, come up with a polished, original, and personal script, rather than the screenplay-by-committee published by the major studios for the sole purpose of commercial gain. Every line of dialog here, rather than succumbing to the pit of tired cliches, comes off original and with personality. Every scene here, the characters relate to each other believably, while remaining completely engaging. One of the best examples of this is in the fantastic scene between Will and Chuckie at the end about what Will would be doing in 20 years. Through Chuckie's blunt honesty he shows us how true of a friend he really is, and the true depth of their relationship. Outside of maybe Pulp Fiction, I don't think I've seen a script this original and absorbing in some time.

Robin Williams gives the performance of his career here, even topping his great work in Dead Poets Society. Here, he's not the schmaltzy, kindhearted savior he's been in his last couple of movies. Rather he's a good, intelligent, but flawed man who is there originally just to guide Will, but ultimately his experiences with will help him confront his own issues. His performance is not superficial, but nuanced- knowing about life, but at the same time, not knowing, and learning along with Will. Similarly, Matt Damon did a great job giving us the outwardly cocky genius-with-an-attitude that is deeply hurt inside and grows to show us that he doesn't know everything, but is willing to learn. Ben Affleck is amusing and honest as his friend Chuckie, and Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver do great jobs in their respective roles as well.

Looking around here, I see quite a few negative comments for this film. Frankly, I'm stunned. The work of everyone involved in the film, particularly Damon, Affleck, and Williams, raises what could have been a complete cliche to cinematic excellence. Everyone criticizes the Oscars for their dubious selections. However, when they honored this script and Robin Williams' performance, they couldn't have gotten it more right.",8
3 January 1999,Troubled Genius,"Good Will Hunting is a brilliant film. It is very well made and written. The performances are great. The story is wonderful. Two powerful scenes stand out. Chucky telling Will he is crazy for squandering his gift and Will and Sean embracing toward the end. GWH is a terrific film.

26 March 2001,Great movie!,"Good Will Hunting is my favorite movie! I absolutely love it! Its the type of movie that anyone would love to see. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote it and it is very well written and a great, great movie. Matt Damon in paticular was great in this movie, but the rest of the cast was excellent as well. You MUST see this movie :)

24 March 2015,Williams and Damon at their best.,"If you are just an average movie fan, then you probably know Matt Damon mainly (if not entirely) from his portrayal of Jason Bourne in the original Bourne trilogy. Do not expect to see him drown to many people in sinks in this movie, but expect to be blown away by his performance none-the-less.

Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor in one of the most prestigious colleges in the world. A math professor of a high level course challenges his students to complete a very difficult equation, which he later admits took him ages to complete. The professor writes the problem on a chalk board in the hallway, and when everyone is gone, Will Hunting completes the equation without an issue whatsoever.

The professors of the college are mesmerized and can not figure out who this secret genius is. Finally they track down Hunting and try to convince him that he needs to be using his vast intellect for research and teaching. They tell him how much money he could be making. What they soon learn is that not every wise man wants a life full of riches and Nobel prizes on his mantle. Some men just want to enjoy the simple life.

Hunting has a mysterious past that is causing him to shut people out before they get too close to him, but one man may prove to be smart enough to breakthrough the difficult past of this genius young man. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), your average-everyday psychiatrist, may be more similar to Hunting than either of them initially realize.

This is one of the first drama films that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish without a single murder or explosion thrown in the mix. Scene to scene suspense, this movie will have you wanting to delve into Hunting's past just as much as Maguire.

If you are looking for brilliant acting, and a powerful message about the greed of the American dream: look no further than Good Will Hunting.",9

24 April 1999,Can you say overrated?,"I couldn't stand this film. After hearing all the hype surrounding its release, I rushed out to see it. What a disappointment! Get real, a conventionally attractive genius works as a janitor at Harvard! What a concept! If this were a spoof or a satire it would be worthy but geez, they were serious!!! And Minnie Driver! How much more whiney and annoying can an actress be! Harvard attendee portrayed as such a loser...I kept crying out to the screen: ""Get a backbone already!"". An overall waste a film. Damon and Afflek are boring, annoying and have about as much charisma as captain kangaroo.

20 January 1999,Loved It,"I came in to this movie not expecting much, but what I got was a powerful movie that taught me that talent should never be wasted. Will Hunting is a man gifted with phenomenal intelligence. He lives alone in Boston and spends his days hanging out with his friends, drinking beer, and beating up old bullies. He supports himself with part time jobs like janitor work. When a college professor discovers that Will Hunting is a genius like no other, he decides to exploit him by offering him top rate jobs that would give him access to great prestige. Will Hunting's therapist, played outstandingly by Robin Williams, want's Will to do what he wants and not be forced to go out into the world and change his entire lifestyle. The movie follows Will Hunting as he matures from a scared defensive kid, to a man able to discover what path to take in his life. Great movie. 9/10

5 September 2020,Problematic Movie,"Main problem of film is realization of protagonist through the movie. The movie tries to establish and ideology about arrogance, experience, genius, intelligentsia, etc. You have to educate yourself by teacher or material or writing to understand mathematics. And you have to this with formal learning. In film, our extremely genius boy easily freestyle the field of mathematics. I have to sample a piece from movie, in a dialogue, Professor Lambeau corrects the answer of our genius boy, and says ""I see you used Maclaurin here."". And boy replies with ""Yeah, I don't know what you call it, but..."". This is pure manipulation. The director and film controls behavior of audience because of perception of mathematics influenced what really mathematics is. Again our boy free-styling mathematics alike hip-hop and overcomes the situation once again. An ugly deus ex machina. I have to imply, I'm not saying people cannot be educated without a college. But field like mathematics, needs to formal education and strict instructions. When you are doing math, there are many precautions, preparations, restrictions and so on. Just look the term, Poincar√© conjecture and solution of it.

And some people might say, don't stick these details too much, see the general idea of movie. OK fellas, I have to admit, only shining thing about the movie, the Sean Maguire aka 6th psychologist against Bad Will Hunting. This man may seem cliche, grown-man, stoic character but I have to credit, the man is good. The message of this character is understandable and clear. Also movie tries to put a better position of him, rather than genius-one. Several times, we have seen, the old man destroys the kid, with his posture. But in the end, movie declares Will Hunting is good and lovable. And foreshadowing of the movie was awful.",5
8 May 2021,"Good Will Hunting, an ode to psychology","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9

23 November 2009,Infinitely awesome movie!,"Sometimes watching a movie with no idea of it whatsoever and hence having no particular expectations from it can be so generously rewarding. That was the case with my viewing of this ""South Boston Drama"" as I'd like to call it.

My honest advice to anyone wanting to watch this movie is just close the web page you're viewing right now and get a copy of the movie and watch it. Instead of breaking my head in figuring out the best way to describe what the movie (which is now in my all-time favorite movie list)is about, I will tell you what it's not. It's not a pretentious movie that tells the story of some shallow people. It's not a movie which though has a great story but goes nowhere. It's not a drama which will make you cry every other scene. It's an honest movie which has got an amazing script that is portrayed beautifully by equally amazing actors. In fact there is a sense of honesty in every character you see in the movie, the lines they speak and even their attitude throughout... and that is the charm of it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's screenplay is way too good which got them a deserving Oscar. Robin William gives a spellbinding performance and is the one to watch out for.

In all sincerity if you could just connect to this movie the way I did, maybe you and I are not so different after all. Pure honest movie-making rarely gets better than this.",10
21 August 1999,Matt Damon & Ben Affleck need I say more?,"This was the first time I had ever seen Ben Affleck in a movie and I was very impressed!

I don't usually go to movies just because of the actors in it, but I will make an exception for Matt Damon.

After picking this guy as a future super star back when he was playing as Mork on Mork and Mendy, it is good to see Robin Williams get the Oscar that I predicted (actually I predicted a nomination).

Damon's girlfriend in the movie was the only weak link in the movie. I don't know if it was just poor acting or just an unbelievable character.

If you liked this movie see Rounders.

27 January 2009,"That Will Hunting, he's quite a character!","All I can say is oh my God, I loved this movie. Matt Damon is so hot in this movie, it's not even funny! I'm serious! I wasn't even paying attention to the story, I was so focused on Matt Damon and his hot bod! And I'm a guy and I'm not even gay, so that says something right there. The girls and gays must go crazy over him. I know I would! It almost makes me wish I was gay! To tell you the truth, if Matt Damon came up to me right now and told me he wanted to have sex with me, I don't know if I would be able to turn him down. And how about that Ben Affleck! I bet he wanted the title role and him and Matt were arguing over it but Mr Van Sant said no on account of he's nowhere near as hot at Matt. Oh well, enough of my babbling. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did!

28 March 2005,slow moving and witless,"This film moved at a glacial pace. The concept that a street tough is an undiscovered genius is difficult to buy in to, but it is an acceptable premise. But it was the stilted dialog and the superficial plot that undermined the whole idea. It took what seemed like forever for anything to happen.

Worst of all was Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who finally turns Will Hunting's head around. His agent must have told him that this was a role in which he could overact to his heart's content.

And the love story amounted to little more than boy loses girl, boy gets girl.

4 March 2010,Good Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting is a moving drama which talks about what makes life livable.

Although Will grew up in humble circumstances and with no parents he's a very talented young man with a great memory and an enormous ability to solve complex mathematics problem.

Because Will's such a genius and had read that many books he thinks to know everything about life. It's Sean ‚Äì a psychiatrist ‚Äì who shows him that he doesn't. Will starts to understand that there are things in life you can't read or learn but you have to experience. So as love.

The movie shows in a great way that there are things we can't explain logically. And that it's worth to fight for the one you love. Even if it means that you have to change your life or give something else up. Especially the end, where Will gives up his old life for a girl is very memorable and moving.

11 August 2005,good script hunting,"Even though the film has been out a good few years, I only got round to watching this last night after many friends had bigged it up. To be honest I did enjoy the film, I thought the script was really good from damon and affleck and Williams performance was top notch and worthy of his Oscar. It was quite heart rendering. The fight scene on the baseball court was not very realistic, and even though Matt played the character of will being a disturbed and lonely young man very well, I didn't feel like he would be the person who could possibly scare anyone. I love the scene on the park bench and the conversation between Will and Shaun, and Shaun stating that just because he has read Oliver Twist it doesn't mean he understands what will has been through, excellent. Overall I really enjoyed the movie and was impressed.

8 January 1999,A script that shows much thought and honesty,"Good Will Hunting is a movie which you don't need to be a genius to understand, you just have to be awake. It is a continually rewarding movie which offers something new each time you see it. A natural reaction the first time one sees Good Will Hunting is to focus on the story of Will, his mathematical genius and his past experience with people. Then the next time you start to realize that they don't overly stress the genius aspect, but simply use it as a way of him to become ""something."" Then you get the conflict between Skaarsgard and Williams about which destiny is best for Will, obviously stretching from some long-standing problems between them. And there's infinitely more. Damon and Affleck both cared very much about what they put into their screenplay, and it shows. If you don't care, then no matter how many special effect you can pour into it, it will never be as good as a movie that you pour yourself into. That is the difference between this movie and so many sub-par excuses.

4 January 1999,"I don't wish to sound patronising, but this is a good first try.","Excellent performances from most of the cast, realistic dialogue, solid direction(From Gus Van Sant who has worked on ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""Drugstore Cowboy""), and some powerful moments make this 1997 Oscar winner(for Screenplay) watchable. The screenplay, for my mind was the problem. It's a good debut, but it's too familiar(eg. ""Educating Rita"" and the novel ""Maestro"" By Peter Goldsworthy""). It's your typical teacher-student film. My brother would like it to be known that I was wrong about the ending, but I wasn't totally wrong, Damon and Ben Affleck are rock solid, and Robin Williams richly deserved his Oscar for another nicely subdued performance(it's a pity he's always playing doctor types). Stellan Skarsgaard and particularly Minnie Driver(sporting her real english accent, which sounds more superficial than her irish or american) are irritating, however. Driver gets a huge laugh though in one scene. Ben and his brother Casey Affleck also have funny moments, as does Matt Damon(a bit egotistical to put himself in the lead, though). Nice, but we've seen it all before.

9 September 2013,A View Into The Mind Of A Genius,"In the past few weeks, one man alone has succeeded in dividing and provoking opinions from across the internet in the most significant entertainment news of the past seven days. Ben Affleck was announced to be picking up the Cowl and continuing the cinematic legacy of the Batman. With Christian Bales performance of the caped crusader still fresh in everyones minds, many are unwilling to give Affleck the chance to prove himself. It was at this point that I decided to revisit several of his different roles from throughout his career in an attempt to come to a conclusion. The first of these films being the touching 'Good Will Hunting', co- written and starring both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.

When a series of difficult equations are solved by a university janitor, he is pursued by a professor after he is arrested following a street fight. Help comes from mysterious places as he is released on the grounds that he meets regularly with both a Therapist and the Professor in an attempt to help him realise his full potential.

He goes through several therapists in quick succession as he outsmarts and analyses them prior to them being able to properly get to know him. This calls for Professor Gerard Lambeauto call upon his old college friend, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Both characters grew up in South Boston, which helps them to develop a connection that will test their limits.

Will (Matt Damon) soon understands that he has met his intellectual equal and their meetings play out much like a game of chess. It's thrilling to watch them both trying to gain the upper hand only to constantly counter each other. Williams is such an accomplished actor, always perfecting the role of the caring teacher as Hunting desperately searches for a father figure after having a turbulent childhood. Realising this, Maguire opens up to share real life experience as the genius has limited himself so much, knowing only what he knows from literature and quotations to protect himself from the pain of losing people.

All the characters have believable motivations for helping Will and it's good to see how they all approach it in different way. From the assertive, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) who attempts to push the genius down various career paths to Sean, who tries to guide him to find his own path, understanding that Wills difficulties originate from the abuse and neglect that he experienced in his childhood.

Although Affleck isn't in the lime-light throughout most of the movie there are several key scenes which really triumph in leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. With honourable mentions to his final, poignant scene. On the other hand, collaborating with Damon to create such an incredible script is a testament to their skill. Far from being a skeptic, this has really made me far more open to his take on the worlds greatest detective.

The movie really tackles many issues as you see the darkness that some talented people can face on a daily basis and how his past overshadows his brilliance, preventing him from taking leaps towards a better life. It really is a film based on self discovery and the events that rekindle his intentions to push himself further in his existence begin as he comprehends how many people care for him. I'd recommend this film to anyone as it can really resonate with any viewer. Everyone will, at some point in their lives, question the path their life will lead and this really is an extreme example of this as he has ran himself into the ground over the years trying to find his direction only to rebuild his foundations and understand his potential.",10
8 September 1998,This should have won..,"I think that 'Good Will Hunting', is one of the best movies, very moving and remarkable. I think 'Good Will Hunting' should have won best motion picture at the Oscars, because it was a lot better than 'Titanic'. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote such an incredible story, there's no way a movie could ever get as good as this. I have no idea how people can put it down saying it's dumb, no way, the storyline was unique to most others, and it had a bit comedy, loads of drama and cleverness. Robin Williams was so great and deserved that Oscar. I though Minnie Driver was very good also, and I have seen most of her films and she is now one of my favourite actresses. I thought Stellan Skarskgard was very cool, and flowed with his character. I don't care what anyone says, but this is a masterpiece and it should have won.

21 August 2003,Good for an American film,"I am thoroughly surprised that simpletons (so I thought) such as Matt Damon and Ben Afleck wrote this. The story is perhaps a little predictable, but I wouldn't call it clich√©. It shows interesting character development and bonding, therapeutic techniques, and the windows and barriers of a genius.

Maybe I enjoyed this because I'm not a genius, and could somehow relate to the writing of two American rednecks.

Good movie. 7/10

10 December 2015,Inspiring and uplifting,"I have watched this film about three or four times now, including twice this year and it has grown on me since I first watched it. If there is one word I could use to describe this film, it is inspiring. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a janitor who works at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is a self taught genius who has no formal education. He also doesn't know what to do with his ability. Enter Dr Sean Maguire (Robin Williams in his career best role), a therapist that helps Will try to make the most of his abilities. The chemistry between Damon and Williams is electric and plays a big part in making this movie magnificent. Very effective portrayal of a therapist-patient relationship. Besides the two leads, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skargard provide great support. Besides their acting, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve just as much credit for their Oscar winning screenplay as the story is uplifting. This film was a bit stiff not to win Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor-Matt Damon but did get it right with Robin Williams winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in a truly touching performance.",10
28 November 2001,VAN SANT SAVES LOSER SCRIPT,"This film has an incredibly clumsy script saved by Gus Van Sant's driving, virile direction, which keeps it moving so that you ALMOST don't realize how disconnected and self-contradictory it is. But even Van Sant can't save a film in which the eerily immature Robin Williams is expected to be believable as a human being.

17 October 2002,Amazing Masterpiece,"I watched Good Will Hunting and I was quite amazed at how the movie turned out. Upon watching traliers I figured it would be a cliche show but boy was I wrong!!!. The acting was excellent, Robin Williams and Matt Damon play their best roles ever as a struggling shrink coping with the loss of his wife and a genius from Southie (yes it is possible). Cole Hauser, Ben & Casey Affleck and Minnie Driver are excellent as Will's friends. I also liked the fact that they put a little bit of baseball history in the movie (Pudge Fisk) as well as many humourous lines. For a movie that catapoulted 2 unknown actors (Affleck & Damon) into superstardom, i rate it 10 out of 10 :) so if you like apples, then i suggest you watch this Masterpiece of a film, then you can tell me how much you like them apples!!!

30 July 2008,Matt Damon's Erdos Number,"Paul Erdos (1913-1996) was a remarkably prolific mathematician. He collaborated on publications with over 500 mathematicians. In a semi-serious way of keeping track of Erdos' impact on the field, authors are assigned ""Erdos Numbers"" indicating how ""close"" they were to Erdos. Erdos' immediate co-authors are assigned Erdos Number 1. _Their_ co-authors (numbering over 6000!) are assigned Erdos Number 2, and so on.

It turns out that Matt Damon collaborated with Dan Kleitman (Erdos Number 2) while Kleitman served as technical adviser to ""Good Will Hunting"". So Matt Damon has Erdos Number 3 - a distinction many mathematicians envy!

14 March 2004,How did I miss this fine film previously?,"I think the title turned me off, and with the cast, I thought it would be another teen film. This however kept me riveted as to how Will would turn out and how his mentors would handle him. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have gained new respect from me for their fine story. Robin Williams was such a silly twit in so many roles, but he deserved his Academy Award as the understanding psychiatrist. As Will said to him, ""I have never met a psychiatrist who talked so much.""

I did not like Minnie Driver. She is very unattractive and even though they explained away her English accent as private schooling, this did not convince me. Even so, it is a fine film and the ending was just right!

1 August 2006,Don't Judge a book by its cover,"This is the perfect example of the old saying ""never judge a book by its cover"". I've never been a Ben Affleck fan but I've always had a soft spot for Matt Damon but i wouldn't give Gus Van Sant the time of day, so i was hesitant in hiring this.

Good Will Hunting is a fantastic film. Its beautifully written (by Matt and Ben), the performances are amazing to say the least (Matt Damon and Robin Williams both give the performances of their career) and, dare i say it, Gus Van Sants direction is worth the price of the admission ticket alone.

Good Will Hunting s a film about a young Boston boy Will Hunting (no surprises there). Will is a genius. He has a photographic memory and he can solve mathematical problems the prize wining mathematicians can not. But Wills very hot headed. Aside from being a genius he also enjoys brawling and getting drunk every night (but who doesn't?). When he faces possible jail time hes sent to see a psychiatrist (Compellingly brilliant Robin Williams) as the tag line says, his match.

This film is so smart in the way its written its almost hard to comprehend that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck actually wrote it (i have faith in Damon but Aflecks contribution is a whole other story). This film deserves all its hype and praise. Willaims deserves his rightful kudos and Damon and Affleck deserve their Oscars. But their involvement in the writing of this film will go down as one of the greatest conspiracy theories ever like JFK's assassination and Kurt Cobains ""murder"".

12 August 2013,Good movie !!!! Better Soul and Characters,"Wow saw this movie finally the other night because I had heard of this movie tons of times from my friends and have always heard references to this movie in other movies and shows on television.

Good Will Hunting , from the great things I had heard from I assumed I would like it and I did - Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did a good job with this script / movie you can tell the work they put in to. The characters that Damon and Williams play are outstandingly brilliant in many ways. Damon and Affleck must have realized as they were putting the movie together as these characters develop so much through out the movie that they would touch the audiences hearts , they touched my heart. As Will Hunting has his ups and downs in life with his brain and some direction in his life from Sean ( robin Williams ) He grows up in a real way that I seen people do in life.

Robin Williams can do comedies and dramas he has proved it in this role and other roles- him as Sean is very clever , witty , gentle has wisdom and very emotional in this movie especially about his wife and about Will in the way they form a bond. When ever Sean talks to Will there is a very special tone in his voice were he relates to Will and understands him very well.

Skylar also added some special touches into Wills life were he realizes what love is and romantic wise ? adds to the movie . and Affleck ? well I finally know who he is and in the movie his and wills friendship is clearly seen after awhile.

Good Will hunting is about a lot of things like Friendship , Love , believing in yourself , Helping out other people , Growing up and much more its a very beautiful movie - I think like a couple other people on here a bit to much swearing but I say this movie gets 8 and thats well!! I might have to watch this movie again soon.",8
17 January 2005,Powerful,"I find it hard to believe that the people who rated this movie low really got the point of Good Will Hunting. I am moved every time I watch it to the point of tears. The language and the acting is just so incredibly real. Everyone knows a Will Hunting type and can relate to that. Or at least I know I do. The message about letting people in and trusting others isn't slammed into your face. Rather, it's shown through real emotion. Although most of us know a Will, I wish we could all have a Sean in our lives. I love this movie and I never get sick of it. It is so original and well written. I stand by my rating of ten. Give it a second chance all of you negative people.

27 March 2000,One of my all time favs,"As you can see, this is easily one of my all time favs...still. It's timeless and still one of the best. Absolutely the best acting by everyone, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgard, and everyone else. A powerful, unforgettable Academy Award winning screenplay, that's extremely original. And it earned Robin Williams his first (and sadly his only) Oscar. I love it still to this day.....and forever

26 December 2021,The classic still relevant in 2021 when it comes to different therapy practices and the importance of companionship in the process of healing,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",8
23 June 2003,Wow!,"This movie can only be described in one word: Unbelievable. Following in the footsteps of Damon and Affleck, trying to make my own work instead of trying to find it, it truly amazes me how well and how hard those two worked over the years to put this movie on the screen. I think, that if Titanic hadn't come out in '97, that Good Will Hunting would've won best picture in a heartbeat, because, well it's hard to beat Titanic, anyway...

This movie goes down on my top ten list of greatest movies, and that ain't no easy acheivment. Yeah, my top ten list means nothing to yous guys, but maybe it will someday...

Good Will Hunting is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. 10/10.

23 November 1998,The Best Picture of the Year,"There are so many things to comment on regarding this film. Unbelievable performances all around, great writing, nice use of lighting by Mr. VanSant, great fight scene shot at 14 fps, I believe. The two main characters (Sean and Will) are delineated beautifully, deepening as the film progresses... And then there is Robin Williams, who once again proves that stand-up comics really can act. Everything he says is just perfect. Amazing. Blew Titanic out of the water.

17 February 2000,Wow. And Wow again...,"I try to read other user comments before adding my two-cents worth. If others have said what I would say...why waste your time and mine? I have a very small video library. You see, to be in my video library, the film has to be SO good it will stand repeated viewing. This film is IN my video library. The script is very nearly perfect. The message is true, and honestly told. The acting...PARTICULARLY Matt Damon, Minnie Driver and, of course, Robin Williams...is superb. Let me admit, I am a Robin Williams fan...almost against my own nature. He irritates me at times, and frustrates me other times..and I'll be the first to say he's turned in some horrifically over-done performances. Then, you see him in something like ""Awakenings""...and you see him in something like THIS movie..and you realize that Williams has the potential of being one of the BEST! Damon turns in a wonderful performance. Indeed, if it were not for the strength of his performance, Williams would probably still overwhelm the film. As it is, there is a ""checks and balances"" thing that happens between them that is simply a joy to behold. Minnie Driver, whom I adored when she was X pounds heavier in ""Circle of Friends,"" startled me. I hadn't seen her since she lost all the weight. Minnie is one of those faces that...let's be honest...can't be called ""fashion model beautiful"" ...yet she is (to me) a kind of real-world sexy. And her acting can be marvelous, and IS, in this film. Her heartbreak is so real in one scene, I almost can't stand to watch that scene. I have to leave the room and fiddle with a soft-drink or something. I want soo badly to sweep her in my arms and comfort her...now THAT's acting! Ben Affleck is a perfect foil to Damon's character...and this very believable story (to me) is wound out in a compelling manner that literally leaves me drained at the end. This is simply a movie with lots of pluses and almost no flaws. Given the story, its length is right...there are a few scenes that could have been tightened in my opinion (mainly between the math professor and Williams character)...but this is ensemble acting par excellence. Please try to give this one an honest look. IT might ALSO end up on your video shelf!",
7 June 2020,Charming,"When he worked as a cleaner, only two people in the world knew the solution formula, when he used rich historical knowledge and clear logical thinking to fight against Harvard students in the bar, when he fell in love and kissed the heroine, he was entangled in the quilt,When he said firmly that I don't love you, when he met a professor of psychology, when he made a rant, when he talked about an anecdote about airplanes, when he cried bitterly, when he laughed. This is a man who cannot be fascinated.

28 March 2018,It was this movie......,"I watched this one with dad. I was only 8 years old. It was more than a good movie, it was a lesson in life, love, hurt and pain. So much expression from such a young actor. Man did I cry a lot. Saw GWH over a dozen times now, and I still cry...

""How do you like them apples"". So perfect. I've used that one a few times....

Then there was Mr. Robin Williams. What do you say about that performance...... xoxo Mr. Williams.

23 June 2001,This was a movie that affected me strongly and caused me to do some deep thinking.,"Good Will Hunting is a realistic movie that has a message about people and life. It works on many levels - the characters and plot are interesting as a well told story, the interactions between Will and the psychiatrist are revealing and compelling, and the questions it raises about life and lifestyle choices are deep and complex. I also really appreciated the relationship between the two friends. The conversation they have while working, when Will's friend tells him about his hope that Will be able to break free of this life, is so real and so beautifully done that I can't think of many film moments that come close. Robin Williams does a great job of creating a character who is flawed, yet incredibly capable of reaching Will and helping him to change his life. To add to the realism, the psychiatrist is also changed for the better because of his interactions with Will. Finally, the photography, attention to detail, and the incredibly good choice of settings and background helps to make this movie believable and great. Everything just comes together so well, it should be considered the best movie of the year. I give it 5 stars, the highest rating available.",10
2 February 2022,Following your heart,"What is your purpose in life? Well, that's a hard question to answer, given that there is and incredible number of possible roles to fulfil. Some of us has quite an easy choice regarding that matter, and they usually end up doing a safe structured routine that they don't necessarily have a passion for. However, a set few of us, get to live one's passion, and flourish doing what you love.

Good Will Hunting is all about letting go of your defence- mechanisms and following your heart doing what you truly want. Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is this genius kid with a life seemingly paved in front of him, but he is in a limbo not wanting to break loose on life itself. The movie excellently portrays how hard it can be to break away this barrier and fulfilling your full potential.

I'm no psychologist but I have the basic understanding that your mind and mental state decides where you are going in life. We all have our bad days, and some are even so bad you are not sure you will ever be able to recover and move forward after days like that. Days like those shape your character and can be a detriment to your future. It is however possible to reflect from days like that and work on yourself to grow stronger mentally and achieve the greatest of things.

Very few of us are born with the genius of Will hunting, but we can all feel with him and feel his personal struggles, because most of us have experienced similar struggles of our own. Feeling with the main protagonist and understanding him is one of the things that makes this movie great.

The movie is shot in a relatable manner and the dialog between the character is very relatable and not very ""movie like"". When watching this movie, you feel that Will isn't the one getting therapy, it is instead you the viewer. This movie is certainly a therapeutic and relatable experience and is beautifully written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.

This movie shows us that there is a way to break down your mental barriers, and we can all grow as people If we work on our mental psyche. Overall, this is a great movie, with a simple but brilliant plot. The scenes are laid out in a simplistic manner and the dialog is also understandable even when the dialog dives into technical territory. I enjoy this movie from time to time, and it makes me hopeful for the future.

My rating: 88/100.",8
12 August 2017,I was extremely moved.,"I was extraordinarily moved by this film. This film is about a boy, Will, who is a genius about mathematics. He is intelligent, but he is poor at the relationship with others. That is the part we can have sympathy for. Each character has their own problems. This film successfully describes human touch, which attracts audiences. This film shows us the human relationship of friends, lover and human. There are a lot of good phrases in this film. One of my favorite phrase is 'The question is whether or not you are perfect for each other.', which is impressive for me because it is the essence for love between men and women and friends. As we see the growth of characters, our horizon for our life widens. This film brings a lot of helpful tips for life into my value. Besides, 'Will' which is used in title and the name of the lead character includes multiple meanings, so the title is the best for this film. This film is the best ever.

16 August 1998,Great Movie,"Good Will Hunting was a great movie. The acting was sensational especially Robin Williams, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck. Minnie Driver could of been better. I will agree with others that say its good but not perfect.If you dont enjoy continual swearing you wont like this film. I dont care how many bad words are used as long it's a good movie.

28 January 1999,Titanic who???,"I loved this movie. I absolutely loved it. I was fascinated by every single aspect of it. Sure, the plot wasn't the most realistic, but who cares? Movies are entertainment, and that's all. The profanity was not that excessive if you spend any time at all with many lower to middle-class people around the age of the characters. In fact, it was downright realistic. As for the acting, it was wonderful watching Damon portray this character who has to struggle with what he thinks he wants, what he is told he should want, and what he finally realizes he really wants. No, I don't think it was the best performance of the year, but it was definitely one of the top five and worthy of a Best Actor nomination. The chemistry between him and Minnie Driver was electric, particularly during their first date and again in the scene in her apartment before he leaves. Robin Williams, in my opinion, delivers his best performance. Sure, it's the typical Williams-drama character from Dead Poets Society and the like, but this character was better with the mental games and interactions with Will. The best part of this movie was watching the relationship develop between Will and Sean. This wasn't an epic movie, nothing too profound, but it was a small movie about love, relationships, and finding yourself, and in this capacity I think it was wonderful. 9.5 out of 10.",10
10 March 2018,10/10 Would Reccomend,"Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston works as a janitor at MIT, despite him being a self-taught mathematical genius. He spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie, Morgan, and Billy. After solving a difficult high-level math problem on a chalkboard in the hallways of MIT, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau, who decides to help Will reach his full potential. When Will gets in a fight and is arrested for attacking a police officer, Professor Lambeau takes a deal to get leniency for Will if he gets treatment from therapist Sean Maguire. Although the movie plunges into and addresses the emotions of each character, like the psychological trauma that Will experiences, it still manages to incorporate lots of humor. There are many instances where the witty banter and hilarious exchanges, especially between Will and his friends, cause the audience to immediately respond with a laugh. ""Good Will Hunting"" was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who portray the two best friends, Will and Chuckie. One might stipulate that the writing and on-screen connection between the two would be mediocre, considering that Damon and Affleck were just in college when they began writing the script and the fact that they were not the big named actors that they are now. But, because Damon and Affleck are actually childhood besties in really life, they make the friendship between Will and Chuckie (and even with Billy and Morgan) all the more authentic. Their friendship and loyalty towards each other is the glue that keeps the movie together; they accept each other for who they are. The already well established relationship between Damon and Affleck reinforces their performances, reminding the audience that family does not just come in one form. Damon and Affleck didn't just grow up as best friends, they also grew up on Boston, which is where the movie is set. The movie included many scenes that were actually shot in the city. For example, the famous scene where Sean has a heart-to-heart talk with Will at a park was actually shot at Boston Public Garden. The movie has had such an impact on audiences that the bench where the conversation took place became a memorial for Robin Williams after his passing. Not only is the bond between Will and Chuckie unmistakable, but also their character development throughout the movie. Usually, the main character in a movie is moving towards a goal and the audience is rooting for them along the way. But, in this film, that is not the case. Will Hunting is not someone who embraces his intellectual gift and, in fact, seems to be against accepting it at all. This sort-of creates a frustration in the audience which, in turn, makes them root for him even more since they want him to learn to embrace it. The movie may seem typical-about some genius kid-but it actually touches upon two very important topics. First off, it addresses the psychology of Will. The movie dives into the psychology of Will and how the psychological traumas from his past have affected him all the way to adulthood. Also, in the movie, Will is faced with a decision: to use his intellectual gift to its full potential, or to pursue love. Just like how Chuckie hopes for Will to be gone one day when he comes to pick him up, the audience wishes for Will to embrace his gift and reach his full potential. But, it isn't that simple for Will and he has to learn to follow his heart and what he thinks is best for him. This screenplay, written by Damon and Affleck was nominated and won an Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe, for ""Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen"". Just by looking at the cast, you can tell that the acting is going to be top-notch. Every role in this movie was cast perfectly and the actors performances were always in-character. The chemistry between Minnie Driver (Skylar) and Matt Damon (Will) is undeniable. Even though Damon wasn't yet a big-named actor, his performance was powerful. Skylar and Will's interactions were effortless, making the audience root for them without the writers needing to keep all the focus on them throughout the movie. No one could play the role of Sean better than Robin Williams. The dialogue that he delivered in the Boston Public Garden became so famous and resonated with so many that, when he passed, the bench where he delivered it became a memorial for him. Robin Williams won an Academy Award for ""Best Actor in a Supporting Role"" for his wonderful performance as Will's therapist/mentor, Sean. The performances were incredibly powerful and believable, and definitely one of the biggest reasons why this movie was so successful and is so loved. Despite the frequent use of vulgar language and the predictability of the overarching plot, ""Good Will Hunting"" is still definitely worth a watch. Although the opening minutes of the movie are slow, the movie as a whole presents a refreshingly enjoyable story of a mathematical genius who is, unexpectedly, relatable as he struggles with the psychological trauma from his past as well as the task of finding his true purpose in life.",10

4 February 2000,A moving and fantastic movie. I never get tired of this film!,"Good Will Hunting is the film that was unlucky to have been made in the same year as Titanic. Sadly while Titanic left with 13, it left Good Will Hunting with only 2, and unfairly so. For while no one denies that Titanic was impressive enough, Good Will Hunting should have left with the credit it deserved. This combination of Gus Van Sant's direction and the divine writing of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck was one of the best films that I have ever seen. You are greeted with Will Hunting, a sadly disturbed guy who has the most amazing mind, yet can not make himself take advantage of this gift because he is afraid of the consequences. The film looks stunning, with excellent use of camera angles, while the relationships between the various characters develop with so much sincerity that you can really empathise with them. The stars of the piece are not Damon and Affleck however, but Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard, as the shrink who is able to get into the head of brilliant young Hunting and the genius maths professor who discovers Hunting and then spends the rest of the film wishing that he hadn't. The casting of Robin Williams in the serious role of Sean Maguire is excellent; after all Williams often performs his best work when allowed to take off the comic mask that he is so well known for. There is little I can find to criticise this movie with, sometimes the music fails to live up to what it could, but that is just nit-picking! When I saw this, I had already seen Titanic and after, I went to see Titanic again. It was then that I realised that the main element of the film that was any good was the actual sinking of the ship, and that the other two and a half hours were merely there to keep you going to build you up to the ship sinking. If you are looking for a movie to show the development of a relationship between two people, watch Good Will Hunting. Good Will Hunting gives you the hope that things can work out in the end. Also if you have the option, I urge you to listen to the audio commentary that you can get on the DVD, and see how things developed during the making of this utterly superb film.",
27 October 2012,Heart-warming drama,"This is a 2 hr movie which i wish was a little longer. For me it can be divided into two tracks, the main protagonist's Will Hunting (Matt Damon) track and Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) track. If I had to rate the Robin Williams part I would give it 11/10, it was perfect, his Back-story , dialogs with Will Hunting,looks, acting...the best i have seen in a Hollywood drama. I could feel his love ,pain & anguish and his desperation to give Will Hunting's life a meaningful direction.

Will Hunting track is where I have a few complaints, his back-story is not that well established. Also his love story which is crucial for the closure of the movie is not convincing , possibly this flaws are because of time constraints, but then again it has more screen time than the Robin Williams track (not sure if there is a longer directors cut out there).Another reason is Robin Williams part is just so great, everything else had to look paler.

Still this a must watch , go see it , I gotta see about a girl !!",8
20 June 2007,Fantastic and Engaging- A Must,"First word for this film is powerful, but that alone is not enough to describe the feelings i have after watching it.

Good Will Hunting is fantastic in almost every way, its writing is fantastic with amazing dialogue and well fleshed out characters who you really care about. The acting is fantastic from every actor involved, I know Ben Affleck gets lots of stick but he's great also, but special praise goes to Matt Damon who portrays the troubled young man to perfection and Robin Williams, who shows what a great actor he can be in the right role, who is the grown up version of Matt Damon who never fully utilized his potential. These are ably supported by the likes of Minnie Driver and Stellen Skarsgard who also put in great supporting roles.

As i said earlier the one thing that stays with you after watching it is the power of the film, this is from the performances and from the story itself. I got pulled in immediately and it never let me go it is an emotional ride but one i would recommend for everyone.",9

20 September 2018,Great Actors. Incredible Story.,"One of the reason why i watch old movies is to find relics like this movie. A thoughtful, relatable, unbiased to someone who will watch them. It's not a love story, comedy, or tragedy. It's not heartbreaking, but it will make you cry, the reason being all the people you can be sentimental with don't have to stay, but you don't have to be alone either and meet new people along the way. And RIP Robin Williams, great performance there.

17 November 2022,A beautiful movie with its flaws,"Everyone has heard about this movie, especially people from Academia. This was one of the first, well-made, and popular portrayals of the life of a mathematician. It nicely portrays how genius is delicate, and requires tender affection in order to be nurtured. The contrast between the callous mathematician and the emotional psychologist displays a theme that is relevant even today. However, this movie comes with its flaws. The love story seems a bit forced, and the lover of the main character seems one dimensional. However, Robin Williams and Matt Damon are phenomenal in their respective roles, uttering lines that will be remembered by generations to come.

30 July 1998,Will Hunting is Good,"Why? I don't know. He's the dumbest genius ever. I'm sure there is someone like him in this world. I mean, there are 5 billion of us. Good Will Hunting tells a cool story very well told, and has a downright moving performance from Robin Williams who really deserved the oscar he won. So did Matt Damon (sorry Jack). The best screenplay of 1997 up there with Titanic. If not for some very predictable moments, this movie was awesome. ***

17 April 1999,Skarsg√•rd for president!,"I loved this film. I can see many people certaintly did not, and I can't quite see why. Matt Damon was, well... not good, but ok. Robin Williams did his usual serious-doctor-guy-with-a-beard, but he did it good so I won't complain. Minnie Driver was unbelievably beautiful as always. But the greatest of them all was, of course, Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Gerald. He was absolutely amazing. He deserved an Oscar award just as much as Williams, if not more!

29 November 1999,One of the best 5 movies of the year.,"After reading some of the previous comments made by viewers on this site, I get the impression some people believe a group of 21 year old guys who go to bars and drink and fight is not realistic. I would suggest they try spending a night in bar and come back to reality. Even beyond realism, this is just a flat-out great movie.

Robin Williams, normally not the best actor in the world, does an outstanding job with this role. He was at the same time funny and insightful and deserved the Academy Award. Damon was convincing as a ""lazy genius"" and this was definitely his best role so far. The script was excellent, and Van Sant got every bit of emotion possible out of his cast. It is so rare to see a dramatic movie like this that combines humor and drama so effectively. Even if, like me, you are not interested in run-of-the-mill drama-tearjerker type movies, I highly recommend this one, because it is fantastic. The only dim spot in the movie is Minnie Driver's character. I've never really liked her, and I found her character to be more than slighlty annoying. Despite this one flaw, Good Will Hunting is one of the top movies of '97, and other than L.A. Confidential, maybe THE top movie if the year.",9
3 February 2004,Moving and inspiring (huge SPOILERS),"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",9
3 June 2002,I like this film,"I really must recommend this film, I had seen it once before on TV but I had been staying up way to late many nights leading up to the film and fell asleep :(..

Now that I have got the film Ive watched it whilst not so fatigued and wow yes sir, good all rounder, the Actors are very believable and satisfying ... Full of intelligent whit and filmed beautifully :) yes 8-10 for me :) watching again some time this year

7 September 2014,Who knew coming of age could be this insightful?,"Good Will Hunting shows us how personal growth and development should be captured on film. An excellent cast, led by a truly capable director, set this punchy drama apart from the herd.

Van Sant brings the relationship between Will Hunting (Matt Damon) - a gifted young janitor with no direction - and his washed out psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) out front and center.

Damon and Williams take on the challenge and present the audience with a deep and profound interaction; punctuated by strong emotion and subtle affection.

Hunting's relationship with the witty Skylar (Minnie Driver) takes shape around Maguire's interaction with Hunting. Driver proves a strong leading lady, providing her character with incredible insight and affection, while keeping the rough edges firmly in place.

Sharp camera work and toned down lighting bring an atmosphere of change to life in the film - while not shying away from depicting the grit and grind of daily life in blue collar Boston.

Expertly crafted and strongly executed, Good Will Hunting is certainly a coming of age drama for posterity.",9
15 August 2002,"In the end, the book would've been better.","I remember seeing this movie with my dad at the movies back in '97. I remember how it hit my stomach and made me shiver, and how I returned to the cinema the very next day to watch it again.

The moment I got it on video, I watched it every day after school. It was a great movie and I loved it. I cried. I laughed. It was a movie about life.

But now, after having seen the movie too many times, every line is like a quote and I'm thinking, this should be a book. I'd rather read the script over and over again than watching the movie another time. Don't get me wrong though, the movie's great, but I think the book would've been better.

This is the movie about Will Hunting, an intelligent kid with a disturbing childhood. Because of his childhood he has psychological issues and does not function well, but thanks to a job he got through his parole officer, he gets in touch with a math professor who takes him under his wings, but what will this mean and how will Will handle it all?

It's clearly a brilliant movie about troubled minds, growing up, and how we're all different in similar ways. Watch this movie once or twice, but refrain from watching it too many times.

24 January 1999,"Much ado about ""NOTHING""...","This was one of the most disappointing films in a long time. After all the hype and people going on about this film I finally watched it and left the theatre convinced those other people were talking about another film. The script was extremely clich√©d, characters so unreal and situations out of a bad after school special. I enjoyed Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's other roles (notably Chasing Amy & Rainmaker) but this was terrible. There were simply too many unanswered questions and ridiculous events. Next time Hollywood wants to feed us this crap, they should take into account that we are all not so moronic to eat it up.

10 May 2007,Very nice psychological drama about a misunderstood genius,"Not the generic type of chic flick you would expect based on other reviews I have read. It's a very nice catching story about a guy who works as a janitor in my favorite city of Boston's MIT. He appears to be a genius in science which is discovered by an intelligent professor. He tries to guide and let Will bloom with the talents he has, along with the assistance of another professor and shrink Sean (Robin Williams), who has some problems of his own. The scenery of the movie in my view is simple and not diverse, but the story of the movie is so strong it is not a problem at all, it will keep you tight to the screen for the duration of the movie.

The way Will's relationship with Skylar is waved into the movie is perfect. It's a good recommendation if you like a touching movie, which is very realistic telling you something about young adults in South Boston and the symptom of being misunderstood.

Awesome, in one word.",9
5 January 2022,psychology,"Really good and heart touching story, i think this was a really good movie for back then when psychology wasnt getting any attention and care it needs to be given. Childhood affects the people so much, such a good example of it we see in wills actions and behaviour. Take care of yourselves and your loved ones everybody.

1 March 2014,"Would Prefer "" Lars And The Real Girl "" But Not Bad At All :)","Do you know that suicide is one of the three top causes for deaths ?

In America specifically , teens and adults too ( 20s and 30s ) then it falls below the third place starting from 40 . Unfortunately , for the whole humanity , we bust ourselves working to find a cure for all pains , and find something to lower deaths' rate of Cancer , heart diseases and AIDS , .. etc but we don't even try to give a shot at one of the most important cause of death , suicide , a person's psychology and inside .

As a student in Med school , interested in Psychiatry in specific , I try all the time to look for movies with the portray of psychiatrists and I get shocked at what Hollywood gives . It almost always shows the therapist/psychiatrist as a totally useless person with some books around . A psychiatrist can save someone . Although I feel the movie is lacking some elements , it's good and deep . I don't know why in specific , but I there are other movies with psychological experiences which are better than this . I recommend it for the ones who would like to see a good drama and some psychological aspects of the human mind . I wouldn't recommend it , however , for someone who's a little more advanced , either as a psychiatrist/therapist or even as moviegoer who's seen deeper ones . Robin Williams was phenomenal . Still , many elements were missing if one wanted to tangle such a thought . I give it a 7 because of its originality back in 1997 and because of the relatively few fascinating scenes as the one at the lake . I would also recommend "" Lars And The Real Girl "" ( mostly ) , "" Crash "" ,"" August: Osage County "" and "" Silver Linings Playbook "" for anyone who agrees with me . They are similar but a lot deeper and will give you wonderful insights into how the human psyche works :)",7
3 December 1998,A movie that truly has something to talk about,"Before i saw ""Good Will Hunting' in the cinema i was hearing about a new talent called Matt Damon who starred and wrote one of the best pictures of 1997. But it was until i saw it that i aggred with all this comments. Good Will Hunting has one of the most original screenplays of the last decade and it's not surprising the fact that its fans are mostly young people. It deals with a very serious matter and manages to examine its every aspect. It's a fresh and original movie, the kind of those we want to see more in the cinemas. Matt Damon is of course the core and the soul of this picture. He co-wrote the screenplay with Ben Affleck and managed to persuade the 'big-bosses"" to make it a great movie. Demon is excellent in the lead and truly deserved the Oscar as his portrayal of Will was utterly realistic.

Robin Williams is equally impressive in the role of the doctor and proves that he can be better in drama than in comedy. But the true revelation of the picture is the great Minnie Driver. She too gives a realistic and heart-warming performance that allows her to be regarded as the most talented actresses today.(Her performances in ""Grosse Point Blank"" and especially in ""The Circle of Friends"" also prove that) Good Will Hunting is along with ""The Wings of the Dove"" undoubtedly the best picture of 1997.",8
25 November 1998,Challenge yourself and get a life....,"When first watching ""GWH"" at a theater in Chicago I walked out of it after an hour. The dialogue was so hard to understand being used to subtitles in Sweden. I couldn't hear or understand half of what was said on the screen and since this is a dialogue driven movie it simply made the whole experience unbearable. Arriving back to Sweden I thought I'd give it another chance (with subtitles this time mind you) and surprisingly I loved it. The premise might be stereotype and cliche, but tell me what movie that isn't. It's HOW the story is told that ultimately counts. ""Good Will Hunting"" is basically a ""coming of age"" movie, but with such well written dialogue and characters that one truly believes in them. The pace is very slow and that fact does the movie good actually. We're not watching a John Hughes movie here.

I can't really understand why so many people who have submitted their opinions on ""GWH"" finds the language so foul and ugly. There isn't more ""F***"" than in any other drama, action or war movie.

The foul language isn't in the movie for show, it's there to flesh out the characters. The fact is that people often use the F-word a lot in real life. Why not in movies then?

All and all, Good Will Hunting manages to be both dramatic and funny with some lovable characters and great performances from Skarsg√•rd, Williams, Damon , Drive and Affleck. This is a movie that could be mention in the same sentence as ""Dead Poet's Society"" and not only because Robin Williams is in it.",
22 October 1998,Oh please...,"Give me a break. The angst-ridden genius...please. As if a genius is really like this, plus it's an overdone character. Damon plays the role very well, but he could have played the character more honestly and not so cliche, maybe like how Tom Hanks played Forrest in 'Gump.'

Otherwise, see it, it's pretty ok.

30 January 2004,A mind-blowingly bad movie,"I tried to watch this on cable, but I kept getting annoyed and finally disgusted and turned it off. What a piece of tripe this is. I have no idea what the folks who rated it highly were smoking, but it is surely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.

The concept is insultingly bad. A kid working as a janitor solves a highly sophisticated math problem? And not just any old college, no. It has to be M.I.T. Yep, I'm sure that happens every so often. From this brilliant premise the movie goes rapidly downhill. Violence, ubiquitous cursing, infatuation with cigarette smoking, social ineptness - ah, the life of the troubled-yet-brilliant youth. How many movies like this have been made?

I found the acting to be smarmy. Cocky and irrelevant, just like the characters, the plot, the writing - the whole movie. It keeps trying to put on the Hollywood-haughty airs and tries to pass itself off as something special. In fact, there's no point at all. You don't care about the kid; he's just either too sharp or too weak, and he can slip between either of them. With all these fake antics you finally just give up even caring the slightest bit. Maybe these actors are talented to some extent, but that is all wasted.

It's one I'm glad I didn't waste my money seeing in the theaters. Don't believe the hype. It is one to avoid.",
19 April 2020,"Boring, unrealistic, overrated","This movie is so overrated, overwhelmed, so overhyped, when I see this movie being considered as one of the greats make me feel go full nuts. The direction was good, acting was great by legendary actor Robin Williams, and features one of the most beautiful songs from one of my fav Elliott Smith, I wish I could have given rated it more just cause of Elliott but no this movie doesn't deserve even a 5 rating, its completely unrealistic, idk why people don't understand, why the people can't get it in their head that things in real life don't work out this way , main character is one of my most hated character ever,becoming a genius was acceptable but the type of arrogant he remains and yeah ofc the greatest thing of all time which he did at the end just justifies its only for those romantic fantasy believers out there.

4 November 2018,One of the most moving movies there is,"I first watched Good Will Hunting when I was 15, and didn't really fully appreciate how amazing the movie is. After watching it a second time, three years later, I can see this movie for what is is: a masterpiece. This movie will make you laugh, smile, cry. You cherish Robin Williams' and Matt Damon's relationship, as they both come to the realization that even though Williams is Damon's therapist, they equally both need each other. This movie is 100% a 10/10!

31 October 1998,The journey's just as important as the destination.,"Yes, the end of GWH is a storybook ending, yet I'd wager that there are few who wanted it to end differently. But that's not what I thought the movie was pushing to. The middle part is the best stuff of the movie. The little moments, the sandwich welfare, the world series game, the piano part, Will's self-defense in the courtroom, the list goes on and on. These moments in the film is what makes it great. These are the moments that allow the audience to glimpse what goes on in these character's minds. Although there's no dialogue when Chuckie goes to Will's house near the end of the film, everyone knows what is going through his mind. The ending isn't the most important part; the fact that he got there and how he did it is the point of the show.

16 July 2009,"Your average day reality-hits-you movie, except better...","I kept rewinding the part in the credits where it said that the movie was written by Ben Affleck. And then I kept looking at the DVD box that said that he won an award for it as well. Never really liked him as an actor, but I guess he has some strength in writing.

So the film is about a young adult named Will Hunting. We see that he lives alone in a small house because his parents abandoned him, works as a janitor at MIT, and spends most of his nights with his friends at bars. But what we also learn in this movie is that Will Hunting is a genius; he has incredible strengths in the fields of not only mathematics, but in all other subjects as well. And when a professor finds out that it was Will Hunting that solved the two Algebraic graph theory problems that was supposed to be solve by a student, rather than a janitor right outside his hallway, the professor goes out to help Will. Under the professor's supervision, Will must educate himself more with Algebraic graph theory class with the professor and sees a therapist two times each week.

The rest is just about him trying to find himself. This movie is great and nobody can doubt it. I mean, the message that the movie brings really entertains me because sometimes we can not judge others for just how they may act everyday. It also shows how there are many individuals out there in the world that may have really high IQs, but do not know how to apply it to daily life. And that is what Will Hunting exactly is.

Now I have seen Robin Williams a lot in stand up comedy and he was really funny. And there were some parts in the movie that Robin Williams was funny. But I am telling you, the Juilliard studying really came out in this movie. He was persuasive with the character he was playing and had parts where he had to keep expression that many actors struggle to have. And those actors are not even comedians like Robin Williams. Matt Damon also acted well going from charismatic joking to deep depressing attitudes. However, I really did not care for Affleck or Driver's acting. It was alright. The thing was that once you saw Damon and Williams act, those two were okay.

The only problem I had with this movie (and if it were not for this problem, I would be giving this film somewhere in the eight range), was that there was unneeded raunchy dialogue and cursing during the back and forth discussions with Will Hunting and his little entourage. I get it that the movie takes place in South Boston, a ghetto if you may say. But still, really? Cursing to make a movie sound good? I mean, I have seen movies where cursing is used a lot more than this film, but there were scenes in this film where you really wanted them to be poignant and because one of the character said the f-word in an incorrect spot during the dialogue, it ruins it. This goes for Damon, Affleck, Williams, and Driver.

But this movie really tied up things great in the end. Everything that may have been confusing all comes down well in the end and you get a piece of reality once you finished this movie. I was going to give this movie a low seven as I watched it, but only when you finish this movie, I will have to give it now a high 7. Usually highly-recommended films would be eight or higher, but I say that this would be a nice movie to watch.",7
2 February 2004,"Good Movie, Williams does a great job.","This is one of my favourite movies, in the same category as Kevin Smith's CHASING AMY. The story is great, backed up by a really great script.

Sometimes I can't believe that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really wrote this screenplay because sometimes I think Kevin Smith wrote it but I could be wrong and may well be completely wrong.

20 January 1999,Deep insight into human relationships,"I love this movie for its depth of insight into human relationships. I am amazed that two young men could write this film. Yes, I could do without the continual bombardment of foul language, but I believe it to be honest to who the characters are. I am saddened to read comments from other viewers who seemed to have completely missed the point. And for those folks who pointed out in the ""Goofs"" listings all the math errors they could find, put down your slide rules and calculators and notice the people in the film! It's a shame this movie came out the same year as ""Titanic,"" because it deserves Best Picture. I bought this video because its message touched me deeply.

Matt Damon and Robin Williams both delivered amazing performances! I loved the movie; it is one of my favorites! You will stayed glued to the screen! Good Will Hunting is basically about a genius who was raised in Boston living the life of a ""slacker"". After getting into to trouble with the law, he agrees to meet with a mathematician and a therapist every week, instead of going to jail. The relationship he builds with Sean, the therapist (Robin Williams) was very moving and unforgettable. You must see this movie!

1 July 2002,Excellent movie...,"Good Will Hunting is an excellent movie that provides a real celebration of the human spirit. Will Hunting is an everyday Joe, who works as a janitor in some college. Despite his meager lifestyle, Will (played by matt damon) is extremely bright and has a gifted and interesting outlook on a number of things. He ends up being sent to a psychatrist, played by Robin Williams, and thus a story about this young man unfolds. Despite very strong language and some crude humor, you start to get inside this guy's head and really relate to him. Underneath his hard shell is just this soft, sensitive guy wanting to be loved. With best friend played by Ben Afflek, who encourages him to get up and leave his life as a shmuck, and girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver, who loves him, he starts to realize he could be making something of himself. A truimphant ending will leave you with bittersweet tears. A stifling performance by the whole cast who was wonderfully chosen. 9 out of ten!!!!!!

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed.

6 January 2005,terrific job from Matt Damon and Robin Williams,"After seeing the remake of Hitchcock's masterpiece 'Psycho' I didn't know if I would ever watch a Gus van Sant movie again. But at a rainy Thursday night there was nothing on TV except Good Will Hunting. Hearing some people say how good this movie was made me want to give it a chance. So I did. Thirst I must that the acting is pretty decent here, even Ben Affleck (who I normally can't stand) seems to know what he is doing here. Robin Williams gives a marvelous performance and so does Matt Damon. I already knew how talented Matt Damon was when I saw him in Rounders and the Bourne Identity, but I think this was his best performance I have seen so far. The dialogue of the movie is superbly written. Some of the sentences really make sense and go deep. The story isn't bad and the character development is also very good. The direction is fair enough although I didn't really pay attention to that. Maybe I even overlook the 'Psycho' remake incident. No not really!!!!!!

But still this movie is very good and I sure recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie once in a while. Grade 8/10.",8

14 October 2006,Truly fantastic Movie,"Not only is the premise very interesting, but Gus Van Sant's use of lighting in this movie is incredible. The screenplay is superb (it won best original screenplay ), and the acting is awesome. I have seen this movie at least 15 times and I love it more every time.

The fact that Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Cole Houser, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams all launched serious acting careers from this movie, is impressive. (Williams had already done a lot of work, but GWH was the film that really gave him the respect he deserves as a serious actor). I have been to Boston 3 times since watching this movie, and each time, I visit Southie (the Irish neighborhood Will is from), the Harvard Bar (Broken Arrow, the exterior shot of the ""Haaa ved Baa"" scene), and Bunker Hill C.C., (the Community College Robin Williams teaches at), in honor of this movie. Truly a classic, that you will watch time and time again.

1 August 2005,Why do Hollywood actresses do British characters so badly,"First I want to say that I thought the movie was quite good, in fact I gave it a 7. Why only a 7? Well I judge by the standards of movies I have seen and I travel a lot. Its not really as fantastic as 'Unbearable Lightness of Being' or 'Moscow does not believe in tears', but that is the price we pay for living in a society where Hollywood hype dictates what people go and see. Audiences rave about the sizzle and not the steak, which I feel is the case with many reviews here. Not only this film.

One irritation I would like to comment on is why o why when Hollywood actors do a British character they ruin it by Americanizing their speech. Minnie Driver's character says 'guy' all the time not 'bloke' as a British girl would. Here's a wake up call for Americans: Hollywood is condescending to you! Yes, they think you are so thick (sorry dumb) that you will not understand unless a British character says fries and not chips. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, it makes us squirm in our seat and detracts from what would otherwise be a very good film. A further note on language, I am not sure what kind of people producers mix with, but my friends from University don't use obscenities in every sentence and I went to an Ivy league University. This comes over as sensation seeking and cheap and again it detracts from the impact of the film in my view.",7
4 December 2000,super cinema,"Good Will Hunting is a really good story, which makes for perfect cinema. A good story, a great script, and a super cast, with a fine director in touch with the material.

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have concocted a great script which is both endearing and funny, while involving for the audience. Damon was fortunate to get the part of Will Hunting, but Affleck does show great class in the small role he has as Will's best friend Chuckie.

The acting, in fact is one of my favourite aspects of the film. Damon is a revelation in his role as the confused and bitter Will, who struggles to let anyone in his life, or get under his Boston skin. An Oscar nomination was justified. Williams achieves a career high with his portrayal of the shrink who helps Will find direction, while also allowing himself find direction too. Williams is perfect for the role, showing great vulnerability, and a soft underbelly. The bench scene where he has a two-minute take with Damon, telling him he's never experienced life outside of Boston, is a moving and enlightening scene made special by Williams. He deserves his Oscar. Minnie Driver was fortunate to get an oscar nomination, but she does show great feeling, and her part was well written to allow her space to make the part her own. She has an expressive face perfect for acting, and she does a good job.

Gus van Sant takes rather a back seat here, visually, to concentrate on the material and acting. He lets the actors show off their talent, and does a remarkable job in bringing out the best in them. Danny Elfmans score is low-key and carries his trademark, if bearing a theme or two from braveheart from time to time.

Good Will Hunting is a great film, full of emotion, and humour and carries a great story along, which everyone can learn from. The characters are original, and the acting is stupendous. This is a must see film, purely because of its sheer class in every department.",10
16 June 2003,10 out of 10,"Easily one of the best films ever made. Great story, great acting,

great. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck not only give amazing

performances, but show that they know how to write a very good

screenplay, I'm glad they won the Oscar in 97', they deserved it.

And of course Robin Williams shows that he can do anything. All in

all this movie is a work of art.

10 April 2007,Simply Remarkable,"I first saw this movie about a year ago, and it still amazes me now. The screenplay is really well written, the cast is great (specificaly Robin Williams), and superbly directed. The movie had me almost crying at least twice, and has a excellent way of keeping you into the story all the way. Minnie Driver gives a good performance too, and I think she should have gotten the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

Personally, I think the only thing wrong with this film is the language, which leaves your ears ringing after a while.

In short, awesome movie, great acting, superb screenplay, and overall inspiring.

4 November 2003,A Powerful piece of Drama and superb screen-writing from Matt and Ben.,"'Good Will Hunting' is a film which shows that both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are not just great actors, but have a gift in screen-writing too. Williams, as always, gives 100% into his acting and it is shown through powerful scenes with Matt and also his comedy that make it happen. I believe both Matt and Ben are really starting to show their skills that they have developed in the film industry and that they will both be soon, actors that everyone will want in their films.

30 September 2017,The worst IMDb 250 movies,"Hollywood at its worst. I have seen almost all IMDb's Top 250 and this one incredibly was/is the worst movie I've seen in that list. When I found this movie in IMDb 250, i looked at the summary and actors which I've found it very weird, Matt Damon and Ben Afflect VS MIT and Math, very weird combination for me. well I gave it a try and I really want my time back! there is nothing new in this movie that you haven't seen before in related Hollywood movies. Acting is not bad well it's not good either. The story hasn't have any ups and downs, very loose and shallow. No connection happened between me and characters at any time. Contrary to story's emphasizing of Matt's intelligence, i couldn't relate to him...Well enough is enough, Bad is Bad. if you want to waste you time well you're good to go. but if you thinking of anything related to Beautiful Mind or anything like that, Don't think of it! I give it 5/10 not 1/10 cause except the bad story and shallow acting it is a damn Hollywood movie!

27 November 1998,Language,"To those who say that removing the language wouldn't have made it any less real:

bullsh....wait, sorry. Seriously, though, the language in this movie is as close to 100% accurate as any movie I've seen in a while. I'll admit that I grew up in a white-collar household, but I have had many friends over the years from blue-collar backgrounds. Both groups swear a lot. I mean a LOT. Young people, when among themselves and with people who won't be offended, tend to relax their speech. Now, is this perhaps an indictment of those young people? Depends on who you ask. But don't attack a film for a fairly realistic account of dialogue between South Boston twenty-somethings. The fault I would find on the dialogue is the snappiness of delivery, but that's the movies. Cleaning up rough dialogue just wouldn't ring as true in my opinion.

8 October 1999,Well Above Average,"`Sweepingly Smart' Good Will Hunting: rated R, 2 hours and 5 minutes

Matt Damon is the troubled boy-genius, Will Hunting. Will was an orphan and abused child who hasn't the slightest idea what to do with his incredible mind. He is janitor at one of the most prestigious school's in the nation, MIT, and anonymously solves an incomprehensibly difficult math problem.

While Will is put into jail for the beating of a group of teens, he is discovered at his work as the man who could explain the formula that no MIT student could fathom. The professor (Stellan Skarsgard) bails out Will under the condition that Will seek professional therapy, and promise to meet everyday to study mathematical equations. By the end of the movie, Will is molded into a decent human being, no longer lost in life; this is all owed to the ideal therapist, Robin Williams. Sean helps Will cope with reality in the present day, as well as the hardships he has faced in the past. With his wife dead, Sean finds himself able to relate to the similar problems of Will. Sean turns out to be more of a valuable friend than therapist.

Will finds that he doesn't understand himself, let alone others. It is only until he openly expresses his feelings that Will is able to find his place in life.

Good Will Hunting is a combination between drama and comedy. It is realistic in displaying the problems Will faces, but somewhat cheesy in proving Will's intelligence. Robin Williams brings out the sentimental side of Will, with some parts of this also appearing corny. Though Will can certainly be a tearjerker at times, the movie blends in many comical scenes, allowing the audience a little fun.

The greatest part of Good Will Hunting is its sincere acting by Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and actual college friend of Damon, Ben Affleck, who plays Will's best friend in the movie. They all seem to play their roles beautifully and effectively, which is what makes the movie so good.

With its superb acting and memorable lines, Good Will Hunting, directed by Gus Van Sant, also starring Minnie Driver, is worthy of an A-.",
7 February 2004,Superlative. I don't understand why people dislike it.,"This movie is absolutely amazing; raw human drama, intense acting, well-structured script and a touching ambience with witty dialogues carried out with a grace and natural fluidity that I haven't seen on-screen for a long time.

Two big thumbs up.

2 October 1999,"Astounding, it is the realism that moves us","Good Will Hunting was one of the most moving movies I've ever seen, dealing with themes of hope, potential and abuse it gave such a real-life portrait that almost everything in the film was something you could easily relate to and felt very familiar. The choice of locations and backdrops were very appropriately atmospheric, as the film was shot in pubs, bars and coffee bars. The film was original and worked on a deeper level throughout, it was able to drop all the usual clich√©d characters and scenarios that populate so many of the mass bulk of formulaic films that account for the vast majority of Hollywood's output. This never strayed far from scenarios real ,and a storyline that could be related to, I first believed and then upon realisation wanted to believe that it was a true story, because the degree of observational accuracy on real-life and the familiar feel of real-life that is believable and credible ,the film had been quite remarkable. It is ironic that many people are not convinced that Matt Damon's character could be a genius and yet could have come from such circumstances of abuse and now be living such a 9-5 philistine lifestyle of laying bricks and nights on the town, as the film manages to persuade us that it is more than just the usual triumph over adversity case. It is a film about abuse ,and in it we are shown that the loss in normal family values and the resulting towing of society's line that that would probably normally cause ,brings up strongly other aspects of a person's character, and this might explain the heightened creativity or ability as depicted by Will Hunting. The story is very psychologically real and is refreshingly not so simplistic as most other popular films. It is so re-assuring to know that the films of this type can be made and can be profitable and that it doesn't always have to be the lowest common denominator that we so feared having a monopoly on the majority of films. He is a maths genius but he doesn't know it, he naively just gets on with it, just like Mozart with the box of wood known as a piano. But when he is discovered by a maths professor ,he must be brought out of himself, and his cocky, confident front that hides a deeply insecure individual whose fundamentals have been rocked by abuse. After being exposed to and brushing off a number of conservative and conformist psychologists he is brought under the wing of a very philosophical psychologist who he has some common ground with. Some of their procrastinations and profundities are alone worth the two hours. For a deeper, more philosophical film that will make you truly think and feel in this realistic view of human nature, there is Good Will Hunting.",
26 October 2005,An inspiring piece of film...,"Every now and then you come across a movie that though including some classic clich√©s, still manages to stand out and really affect you. Somehow this movie achieves just that. One can think that there's nothing special about this move. That there's nothing more to it than beats the eye. Well I beg to differ.

I first saw it back in 2003 and was completely absorbed by it. Back then I even considered it one of my favourite movies of all time. I saw it again this morning however and have to admit that it's maybe a bit too convenient to like sometimes. The overall great plot has some flaws, but it's still a great movie. I wouldn't go so far as to call it my all-time-favourite, not even close, but I still think of it as ONE of MANY personal favourites.

One of the factors that make this such a great movie is that it includes top notch acting. Damon and Affleck are really great along with both Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Robin Williams who put on tremendous acting, especially Williams. But alongside them I have to say that Minnie Driver as Skylar also brings something to the deal that is well worth appreciating. She has this natural charm to her, that is quite unique and adorable.

Except from the great and talented acting, I fell for the plot. It appealed to me. Inhere also lies some of the clich√©s, but I feel that they made it in such a way that they get away with it. I don't now how. Can't really put my finger on it. But it works. They pulled it off. I found myself drawn to the mix between drama and humour, and was mostly intrigued by the relationship that develops between Will (Damon) and his therapist (Williams).

There's something rather fascinating and inspiring about this film. I highly recommend it. I wish I somehow could capture the essence of the film and express it to you in a better way, but I guess you'll have to see it for yourselves. At least do that and make up your own opinion about it. It's worth that much. And even though you against all odds :-) should disagree with my judgment, I doubt that you'll find it so bad that you'd end up regretting you watched it.",8
18 July 2009,Beautiful Film,"The only thing i knew about this movie before i saw it was that it had a lot of swear words in it. I don't really care to see movies I Don't know much about but I decided to give this one a try none the less.

To sum it up in a few words, I was Blown away.

From the acting to The Oscar winning screenplay this movie will touch you in a truly unique way. The movie starts of with Will Hunting (Matt Damon) going through is ordinary day to day life, which is filled with hanging round with his buddies, his part time job as a janitor and brutally beating up jerks. Although is high intelligence is apparent and shown through all this you can't help but wonder whats really wrong with this troubled genius. So after the Math professor of the collage catches him solving some the impossible sums he set for his class, he decides to bail him out from prison (kicking a cop in the crouch will get you there pretty quickly no matter how smart you are). So Will is bailed only under certain conditions which are that he must attained a weekly math class with the professor and meet a psychiatrist twice a week. Although the math classes are working out well, Will is convinced the does not need a psychiatrist and makes sure that all best possible options turn tale and head out the door. Thus the professor his forced to go to his former collage room-mate for help. This is where me meet Robin Williams in his Oscar winning role of a troubled psychiatric with his own troubled past.

This is where the movie lingers on and has we try do go deeper into Will thoughts we find more and more about the other people in his life whom he seems to have a profound effect on. Something people will notice is how Will's problems in his life are not so much different than ours and with Gus Van Sant's brilliantly simply direction it is shown with more heart than you can handle. As Will goes through problems with his love life, his past and what his future hold for him, we realize his life his a potential that all our lives should be. Apart from this each character is superbly distinguished as each play a different role in Will's life which is one of the many fine touches of the screenplay. This movie is almost all dialogue and the dialogue is pretty heavy most times thus not making it appealing to everyone's taste (which movie really is) but I highly recommend it as it one of the few movies that by the end of it you'll either smile or cry because you will look back at your life in truly different way.",9
10 July 2006,One must be pretty sharp to think about this movie.,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",8
4 May 2020,Best Movie Ever,"I can confidently say this will be my favorite movie for the rest of my life. The storyline is unique, inspiring, and penetrating. The authenticity of every performance is as good as it gets, especially from Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and Minnie Driver. There are so many nuggets I circle back to time and again throughout the course of my days. I especially love the ""club a baby seal"" scene and the ""ya suspect!"" scenes. I point at my husband and yell ""ya suspect - - ya you!!"" at least 5 times a day. I'll never forget Sean's (Robin William's) wise words about not really arriving at a place of true wisdom until you know what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. Until then you're just (wicked) 'smaat' and spouting out facts you've memorized from books you've checked out at the public library. I think it is such a beautiful coming of age story and it stays with, and matures with, the viewer in every season of his/her life. I can't think of another movie that has been so refreshingly authentic, so chalked full of perfect one-liners, so genuinely reflective of what it means to be a student of academia and the real world, and so powerfully representative of the magnitude of having someone just believe in you.",10
20 July 2002,Definitely Worth Renting!!,"I just have to recommend this movie to anyone who was wondering whether or not it's worth it. It's so refreshing to see a movie that has characters that have depth and are believable as human beings. The acting and script was wonderful...everything a good movie should be.

11 October 2004,the celebrated screenplay deserves all the hype,"It's great to see the film that propelled Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deep into the slime and bowels of Hollywood (and in Mr. Affleck's case, before banality and big budgets crept in). Here, the two are inadvertently amusing and prove that the celebrated screenplay deserves all the gloss ¬ñdespite occasional lurches into intellectual pretension.

Damon simply oozes with intelligence ¬ñand you simply believe him, 'psychological issues' and all. American academia's nefarious exploitation of genius, corporate capitalist corruption, friendship, the hypocrisy of The Good Life, finding your own niche in the world- these are among the things grazed by and effortlessly woven into the dramatic flow of the story- which is ultimately ""Good"" Will Hunting's discovery of self and love. The terribly maudlin Robin Williams injects warmth and scruples, and the Elliott Smith music resonates with redemption.

2 August 2023,A Masterpiece in Character Study. A Symbol of the Things We Forgot as a Society,"As of 2023, the year in which this review is being written, we have forgotten that these types of movie were the ones at the height of mainstream cinema.

Nowadays, we are accustomed to big budget movies that focus too much on how they show images on a screen rather than what they are trying to tell us through those images. That has led us to a weird moment in the movie making industry. The centerpiece of current movies are these big actor and actresses that have become a sort of cultural pillar of the industry. Making them seem ""higher than life"" and do incredible things on the screen is the most important thing, the story that is being told plays second fiddle to that.

So to watch a movie like Good Will Hunting is a huge breath of fresh air. We can relate to every single character in the movie, at some point or another, and the magic happens precisely because of it.

From a genius young man with a dark past, to an academic mastermind in the math field, to a student who struggles to balance her academic and personal lives, to a promising psychologist that has given up on life due to the lost of the love of his life, it is uncanny how they are all so different, and yet so relatable. As the movie moves on, and we start to peel the layers of these characters, we get to truly know them and see how they struggle with feelings that we wall have. We see how these feelings affects their lives, as different from our as they might be.

At that point, all these characters get together to tell us a wonderful story that is universal and can resonate with each and every one of us.

The movie was impeccably written by the newcomers (at the time) Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who also showed incredible acting skills. The combination of Matt Damon and Rachel Majorowski (who unfortunately we never saw again in the mainstream) gave us some really touching and deep moments. Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's brother and one of my favorite actors, was already showing the depth of his acting. And needless to say that Robin Williams, one of the all-time greats, brought heart and soul to the movie with his perfectly balanced acting complemented by the always reliable Stellan Skarsg√•rd.

The writing is simple, but effective in its character study and clever on how it makes us connect to the characters and feel their vulnerabilities not a sign of weakness, but strength and bravery. Vulnerability that was lost to us a society, in an age where everyone tries to be as invincible and powerful as the ""super characters"" we see on the current movie screen.

Sometimes, we don't need to save the world or change the political landscape of society. Sometimes we need to fight the battles within and understand that the biggest winnings are done by connecting with others and accepting our vulnerabilities. Only then can we move on to a better place in our lives.",9
30 March 2002,"wow, who knew?","So, here i am, watching this brilliant drama about one low class guy with a gift whose wants to ignore his chance for a truly better life. He's talking to his best friend, telling him that he's going to stay in the low life he's lived since he was a kid. But his friend looks him strait in the eye and tells him that he can't life like this anymore and he has a true chance in life. As i was getting misty eyed and sad at this amazing seen one thought popped into my head...THIS WAS WRITTEN BY BEN AFFLECK AND MAT DAMON!!!!!! How could these two actors, one a kinda famous actor who's only really good on a Kevin Smith movie set, and the other whose doesn't have any claim to fame at all write an amazing screenplay that's touching and funny and sad. The characters were great, the acting and directing was great and everything in this Movie gelled so well! Robin Williams gave the best performance of his career (aside from Rainbow Randolf of corse!) and Matt And Ben proved they are great actors under the direction of someone besides Kev Smith! Hell, even Casey Affleck is good!

21 February 2002,"young, rebellious intelligent guy comes to grip","I've seen this movie seven times already, and each time I like it better. It is also the only movie thusfar that has brought tears to my eyes and left me unable to make some kind of wise-crack to release the emotional tension (the moment Will Hunting breaks up). Everything about this movie is brilliant: the photography, the acting (what a performance by the ever so irritating Robin Williams, whom I forgive all the Flubber, Jumanji and Robin Hood-crap for this flick), the story, the dialogue, the music.

The story starts of as a no-good punk teenager drama, with lots of swearing but already the emotional weakness of the characters can be sensed underneath the tough surface. It then develops into a story which beautifully explores how difficult it is to love someone if you haven't had a loving childhood, and are inclined to distrust people. Out of fear of betrayal, out of a desire to keep control all the time, Will Hunting (a superb Matt Damon) first tends to settle for nothing rather than to have the high peaks and of course the great downs that inevitably come with relating to people other than himself. In the end he learns that his first option in unliveable, through some sublime dialogues with his surrogate father, the psychiatrist (thank you, thank you, Robin Williams) he gets to know

Then there is the music, of course. Very seldom have I seen a movie that had such appropriate music in it as the Elliott Smith songs: as well textual as musical After seeing this movie, I've started buying his work like a madman, and I can assure you: it's worth the buy!",10
29 September 1998,...Good Will Hunting is a diamond in the rough,"On a shoe-string budget, with a less than well-known cast, Good Will Hunting once again proves you don't have to spend a lot of money in Hollywood to produce a first rate movie with a first rate ensemble cast. Matt Damon (Will Hunting) and Ben Afleck are buddies who wrote the Oscar winning screenplay together. Damon also garnered a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Minnie Driver (As Will's girlfriend Skylar) and Robin Williams (as Will's counselor Sean Maguire) were also nominated as Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively. Both are superb in their supporting roles.

The plot concerns an MIT school janitor (Damon) from South Boston (""Southie"") who has a special gift when it comes to numbers. Rather than apply that skill, Will prefers hanging out with his childhood friends drinking, getting into fights and carousing with women. When Will completes a mathematics equation posted for the ""real"" students at MIT, a math professor becomes curious and tracks down Will. Seeing his potential, he takes Will under his wing. As a condition of his freedom (Will's arrested for assault), Will must undergo therapy. After running through ""shrinks"" like women run through nylons, the professor seeks out his old college roommate (Sean), also a hard case and when Will and Sean finally begin to trust each other, things change for Will in his thoughts about his future and in his relationship with Driver.

Well-written, with a down to earth, realistic look at New England life, Good Will Hunting is a diamond in the rough. With some of the best lines (had me laughing out loud) and well-crafted dialogue, this film soars above most of the movie fare. With a running time of 2:05, this film never drags and leaves you wanting more. For an uplifting, intelligent, thought-provoking and, most importantly, entertaining film, put Good Will Hunting at the top of your must see list.",10
15 August 2014,"Simple story, Beautiful telling","The Good

A great ensemble cast who play their roles perfectly. But it's the stand out performances of Williams and especially Damon that keep you hooked. Their immediate portrayal of polar opposite characters is the cornerstone for the film and watching their characters and relationship change is nothing short of brilliant. Many stand out moments from both but then Damon has his breakout moment and steals the show. The writing from the young Affleck and Damon is transferred very well to screen. They take a simple premise and slowly pull it apart until we have something beautiful to watch. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's sad. The writers make us relate and the actors make us believe in equal measure.

The Bad

While the writers work the premise well, there are moments that are somewhat predictable. We know where the film is going and have worked out early on how it will end. They gave us great moments of drama, but no big twists in the story, it is very linear and i never felt like the route of the film would change. Also I felt it ended a whisker early. One more shot would have ended it well.

The Ugly

This is nit picking by now, but William's introduction followed the rather cheesy and much used line ""Well there is one more!"". This line wasn't needed. We knew Williams was coming and such an important character deserved a non clich√©'d welcome.",8
30 November 2005,"Damon + Williams + Math = Strangely, Brilliance","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",7
4 March 2001,An injection of motivation and spine-tingling inspiration.,"It didn't have bombs. It didn't have comets. And it didn't have a gigantic, sinking boat. Bottom line? Didn't need it. In this inspiring, fantasy-wrought screenplay brought to life, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon prove that a down-to-earth, low-budget film can capture magnificence without all the special effects and larger than life cinematography. With Gus Van Sant, the envisioner of the movie, and the unsurprisingly superb Danny Elfman behind the musical wheel, Good Will Hunting deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. Titanic was predictable and true; Good Will Hunting offered a new story to the genre of fantasy screenplays, and it was evident in its winning Best Original Screenplay. As deserving as this was, the Academy fell far short of a consolation prize when it denied it Best Picture. See this movie and follow along with Will on his magical ""hunt"" for a future and security.

16 June 2015,Good Will Hunting,"The winner of Project Greenlight, ""Good Will Hunting"" to me deserved to win every award that there was giving in 1997. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did an amazing job depicting the want to be good enough to move on with ""will"" a metaphor established for the main character ""Will"" as he journeys from his innermost want to a real goal in society. The story journeys with Will as he battles his own demons for a chance to express himself in smarts. The movie explores the differences in classes in society in Boston but really stood as a metaphor not just for that difference in society, but of gender, status and affiliation as well. Themes that came up were ""boys will be boys"", ""I am the King of my own mansion"", ""where there's 'will', there's a way"" and ""dreams, they do come true"".

4 October 2013,Good Will Hunting. Coming-of-age story.,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",

30 July 1999,Top Choice,"This movie has an excellent script, great acting, superior dialog, and appropriate casting. It's almost hard to believe that Damon and Affleck could have developed such an intelligent script at such young ages. Perhaps they got help? Who knows...and who cares. The final result was a simply great, human, moving story. Robin Williams certainly earned his Oscar. The only faults I found in the movie was William's failure at maintaining the Boston accent consistently (yet his acting made up for it so completely, I STILL think he deserved that Oscar) and the somewhat labored idea of an alcoholic father being the root of a kid's problems. The KBONE rating: 10.

2 December 2001,`¬Öhow do you like dem apples?',"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are accredited for winning the Oscar for Best Screenplay for the film Good Will Hunting. Directed by Gus Van Sant, the screenplay is brought to life very skillfully and with poise. While both actors had a part in its conception their involvement does not end there. Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a disillusioned and seemingly lost orphan genius from `southie.' His friends, i.e. Chuckie played by Ben Affleck, are his only support in a world which is very cold to Will. Will's emotions and frustrations come to life through violent rebellious actions. Robin Williams plays the role of a psychiatrist who helps Will to find his place in society, and inevitably the `good' of Will Hunting.

29 March 2023,Good Will Hunting is Iconic,"Good Will Hunting is a film filled with charisma, and realness. What I mean by this is it plays with the theme of wasted potential or the getting out of mentality. Will Hunting represents an un tapped potential that when nurtured becomes the next big thing but in the end it is not what he seeks Will just wants to be human and live life. This take on the wasted potential mentality is an unpopular one that has not been tapped before this film aired. Chuckie Sullivan is real. We all know a Chuck. Chuckie represents the realness of bitter life but also hope and comfort. Which represents the getting out mentality in it's most common form.

5 July 2002,Great movie!!A must see!!,"This is such a good movie it's unbelievable!!! It is a mix of humor,tragedy and romance-very well rounded. I must admit I was not interested at all in seeing it, even after it won the Oscar. Most Oscar winning movies aren't worthy...but this one is! I was at my friends house sleeping over, it was about 2 in the morning, and i could not take my eyes off the screen. This movie is amazing, although the cursing gets a bit much, it adds to the feeling and tone of the movie. It also helps that Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck originate from the area, making it more realistic.

Damon, Williams, Driver and Affleck all deliver touching performances that really make you relate to them. The story is awesome and I highly recommend it!!

17 March 2007,a journey through the human self,"THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

i was surprised when i knew that it was Matt Damon and Ben Afflick who wrote this deep movie especially when discovering that Matt was just 27 and Ben 25 at that time. how were they able to dissect the human psyche in this brilliant, subtle way at such an age? Will Hunting is a psychologically disturbed guy who has been severely abused during his childhood and thus decides to take a defensive, aggressive approach towards every body outside the small circle of his closest friends. Will is a real genius in science yet his sense of loneliness, fear and emotional deprivation doesn't allow him to make use of this heavenly gift. he repels people out fear of going through more sufferings, of discovering that they are not up to his expectations, of being stabbed or deserted by somebody he becomes attached to. Will translates his anger into a series of hostile acts which reflect an unconscious desire of revenge against those who tortured him as a kid.

yet things seem to take a different course when professor Gerald Lambeau discovers Will's brilliance and decides to put him on the road of fame and success, an attempt the boy strongly resists because he doesn't have the will, stability, and strength that help him choose the route he wants to follow.

through psychological therapy sessions which Gerald arranges for Will, (Sean) the shrink succeeds in uncovering Will's old, untreated wounds giving him the courage to derive his judgments out of real experience noting that ""nobody is perfect"". Sean gained Will's confidence through open-heart talks away from the traditional patient-doctor relation. i felt some similarity between both characters, i don't know why. may be because both of them suffered in childhood or because Sean was satisfied with doing what he wanted to do, regardless of what others think of him, and tries to help Will reach the same satisfaction. may be Sean is not as famous as Gerald but he is in peace with himself.

i liked the part when Will asks Sean ""didn't u think of remarrying ?"" ""My wife is dead,"" Sean keeps repeating- it is an emphasis of that idea of a ""soulmate"".

i liked Ben Afflick's part as Will's true friend. he urges him to go and pursue his career though they may never meet again. Afflick feels that Will he is a different guy,he has got a talent that should not be wasted in trivialities. in brief,he is a true friend.

the acting in this movie was superb Damon, Williams were the most shining stars yet the whole cast was great. two scenes i liked most: firstly,when Sean takes Will to sit by a lake and starts talking to him about the importance of going through experience. secondly. the climax scene when Will bursts into tears in Seans arms, it a moment of catharsis and relief.

the movie is a search for one's true self and a quest for man's ability to overcome his past sufferings and look forward for a new tomorrow.",
24 October 2017,Extremely Overrated,"i found it really overrated, i mean the movie was very slow & felt like they were stretching the scenes, they could have used the concept a lot better but, i think in the old times this was the kind of movies people liked, but today us the new generation will find it extremely boring. so to sum it up, if you are born after 2000 you won't like it. i am sorry if it hurts

16 July 2002,A thought about the language,"Stepping on soapbox...

Clearly a lot of people think that the use of the F-word in this film was borderline criminal, unrealistic and offensive. I'd just like to set the record straight.

1) Having grown up and worked in the Boston suburbs, I've found that the film accurately portrayed the way young men talk with each other, swearing and all. Anyone who doesn't believe this simply hasn't been to Southie or Revere or Lynn or any of the other working class towns in Eastern Mass. You may not like it, but it IS realistic.

2) What's to be offended at? They're not swearing AT you. They're not even swearing at each other. They use the words not to offend, but as part of their group palare. It's part of the culture that binds them. They're not even real words as they convey no meaning. They're more like interjections.

If you're offended by the use of words, I ask you to examine what exactly you're afraid of.

19 December 1999,A very good film,"This is a very good film. You can clearly see that it is an inspired piece of work. It doesn't look like it in the beginning but it mostly holds your attention. The acting (esp. R. Williams and M. Damon) is strong. The script is witty and it avoids all the stereotypes. What I certainly enjoyed in it, was the picture of the city of Boston: the university but also the outskirts of town. The city plays an important part in this film. It surprises me that 2 protagonists wrote the script of this film. I hope they'll follow this path. So, we'll enjoy more quality American main-stream films. The film makes you think about what it means to grow up in a certain social class and how you watch your intellectual capacities. It is an optimistic film which makes you smile (and cry maybe). And it isn't difficult to swallow. But at the same time, you don't get an easy message. As I said, this film isn't stereotypical. And, although it has an ""happy ending"", you never think this is just your next corny American Hollywood film. A surprisingly good film !!

16 May 2000,"Overrated, but not bad","""Good Will Hunting"" was not a bad movie at all, but I don't believe it deserved the accolades that it got. While I found that the acting was quite good, I didn't think the story was terribly engaging.

Bottom line -- Matt Damon's character did not gain my sympathy, as he did with most people who have seen this film. Essentially, we are dealing with a very smart kid who is also an obnoxious, unkind person. I don't care if you have a bad job or come from a broken home. In my book, those are not excuses to be a jerk. I personally know people who have had much tougher lives than Will Hunting, and they still treat their fellow man with the utmost warmth and kindness.

So with the main character not winning me over, I found I really had nowhere to go with this film, since it is almost entirely focused on Damon's character and his struggles. I didn't feel myself rooting for him, which was a huge impediment to me getting anything out of this movie.

Again, ""Good Will Hunting"" is hardly a bad movie. I am certainly not saying that. However, I don't understand why people consider it to be so great.",
30 December 2007,A True Inspirational Movie.,"Good Will Hunting is about inspiration. Its about the ""good"" before ""will hunting"" which says every man is good, and he has got his history, and its all about bringing that ""good"" from a human being. Its about the connection between teacher and student, doctor and patient, father and son. 10/10.

This story is kinda mystery, the more it unfolds the more it leaves for you to see and imagine. I liked the way it started, u know kids fighting and drinking and wooing girls blah blah, but it takes u for a ride when Robin Williams, which I felt was the best puller of the movie, comes into picture. Not surprising that he appears first while listing the cast, even though he appears among the lasts actually in the movie.

Its about relationships. Its about friendship between Will and Chuckie. Its about love between Skylar and Will. Gerald and Sean are old friends, though they fight over silly principles and beliefs. Its about those fights. Will had no future before he met a mentor like Sean. Its about that bond. When Sean says ""Good Luck, Son!"", it means the depth of that teacher-student relationship.

Everyone of the cast has done their jobs beautifully. Matt as Will is like a true brat, but smart, genius at the same time. Ben is wonderful. Wish everyone has a friend like him. Skylar is a smart girl, at the same time longing for love. She is beautiful too. Gerald the professor is really good in all of his work. Of course reminds me of college days. But the person who steals the show is Sean, played by Robin Williams. I liked him so much that I read a lot about him, probably I would check out his other movies too.

All this tells u is ""We have got answers for every damn question in others life, but what is more important is to get answers for those questions, when Its My Life!""",10
18 June 2021,A timeless classic,"Despite being named one of the most over rated films of all time by many, ""Good Will Hunting"" is a different, brave film that presents uncomfortable topics rarely spoken about by men including dreams and emotions. While the story itself is solid it is really brought together by incredible performances by the young Matt Damon, Robin Williams and almost every other actor. While it may not be perfect it most certainly is timeless and well worth the watch if you have 2 hours of concentration in you.

26 November 2002,Isn't great that shrinks always have the answers?,"Let's see, will has a brain the size of the universe, but he just sits around in his apartment drinking beer and reading undergraduate textbooks. He's never had a real relationship, but we're supposed to feel that Minnie Driver should fall in love with him because...well, for some reason or other. He sees her as a way of proving himself superior to the wealthier types actually enrolled at a university, but, well, we just know that underneath he's got a heart of gold...God knows why... Wait; am I actually supposed to like this guy? Even Minnie Driver's character doesn't seem to; she's more like someone having a polite good time with a mere acquaintance than any sort of potential girlfriend. Even Robin Williams character seems to see Will as basically negative, if excusably so, and his portrayal of an incredibly nice guy almost proves that Will needed that just to relate to others. This film is not about an interesting character, ""darn"" it! It's about a jerk who we have to assume to have some redeeming something-or-other inside him.

5 July 2015,"Emotional, Inspiring, Brilliant","Directed by Gus Van Sant, Good Will Hunting is the story of a mathematical genius named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon. The film takes place in the campus at MIT, where Hunting works as a janitor. One day after his class is over, mathematics Professor Lambeau writes a problem on the board that took several MIT professors two years to figure out, and challenges his students to solve it. When Hunting sees the problem, he solves it by himself in a matter of minutes. The movie then unravels the genius in him, but also portrays his many weaknesses and his rough childhood.

One of my favorite aspects of this film is Hunting's relationship with the psychologist Sean, played by Robin Williams. Sean is persuaded by Lambeau to council and give advice to a metaphorically speaking ""lost"" Hunting, after Hunting gets sent away from five other counselors. Sean asks Hunting some thought provoking questions that lead him to pursue the dreams of his heart.

Their relationship is like one of doctor and patient, as Hunting describes toward the end of the film. Sean tolerates him even after horrible disagreements and arguments they had with each other, and he never loses hope in him. Sean is one of the few people that actually understands Hunting, and why he does what he does. Unlike Lambeau, who often sees Hunting as an object of great power to be handled with force and control, Sean puts himself in Hunting's shoes and relates to him. For that reason, Hunting reciprocates this friendship and learns to trust Sean's judgement. A major portion of Hunting's actions at the end happen because of the advice that Sean had given him.

Another great aspect of this film is the dialogue. The dialogue between few characters in this movie flows very naturally and really moves the story along. Whether it's between Hunting and his three closest friends, between Professor Lambeau and Sean, or between Sean and Hunting, the dialogue is incredibly real.

A major theme in this movie is finding oneself, and finding what one really wants to do with his/her life. Talent and natural ability is one thing, but how will you use it? Will you just let it go to waste and stay comfortably in the status quo? Or will you go out and seek the adventures that your heart desires? Hunting has trouble identifying what his passions are, or what he wants to do with his life. When asked by Sean, Hunting cannot give a single straight answer.

As far as I'm concerned, this film doesn't have any flaws, though some parts of the film may not be entertaining for everyone, and the beginning starts off quite slow. Other than that, I think people who enjoy watching classic films will love Good Will Hunting.

After nearly twenty years since its release, Good Will Hunting remains one of the most powerful films ever made. This movie has a lot of heart, wit, and fun in it, though it revolves around a much more serious theme. This film is one of the few that can break your heart yet leave you smiling. Good Will Hunting is one of my favorite films of all time, and is definitely worth watching.",10

17 May 2020,A Reflection of Inner Self....,"The movie felt like a story about myself, And I can say that, many people will feel it as their own story. The bad experiences of past holds us to be free. The regreats makes the life worse. The movie is about living free, living life without regreats. It will surely compell you to ask questions about ""The Why"" behind your present.

Here are some best dialogues from movie which I loved: 1. ""You'll Have Bad Times, But It'll Always Wake You Up To The Good Stuff You Weren't Paying Attention To."" 2. ""You're Not Perfect, And Let Me Save You The Suspense: This Girl You've Met, She's Not Perfect Either. But The Question Is Whether Or Not You're Perfect For Each Other.""

8 August 1998,97's Best,"Good Will Hunting isn't a formula movie. It's plot has been used before, but it's wholly original. It's a wonderful character study about friendship, potential, love, and most importantly, low self-esteem. Most don't think about the low self esteem part, because Will was a cocky kid. But low self esteem was the whole reason he wouldn't capitalize on his gift.

Will is a high school dropout who works as a janitor at MIT. Gerald Lambeau put a problem on the board in the hall, and Will solved it. Before the Lambeau can talk to Will, he gets arrested for punching a cop. Will gets released into Lambeau's custody under the condition that he sees a therapist. He scares off a few (in some very funny scenes), and finally sees one who is much the same as Will. Through each other, they both learn to get on with their life, and put the past behind them.

The performances are some of the best of the year and even of the decade. Robin Williams does his career thus-best in this movie. He plays a father figure to Will, even though the script only once hints to this. He had some of the same past as Will, and he is not only a father-figure to Will, but a best friend, and even a brother. He had grown up in the same neighborhood as Will. He had been abused like Will. So, they related to each other on a different level than Will could with anyone else, and on a higher level than Will wanted to relate to anyone else. He spoke the same language as Will did, that was the reason Will would listen.

Minnie Driver received an Oscar nomination for her work in this movie. I thought she did career-topping work too. She had a very sketchy role, but did sorcery with it. She was excellent. She had opened her heart to Will, only to have it crushed. And then, after that, she still loved him. She didn't have the biggest role by any means, but she had an extremely important role.

Matt Damon through the movie. He gives the best performance in the movie, hands down. His character is desperate, yet afraid of answers to questions that he can't find in books. The role is so complex, that you forget that he had to act in this part. He had to play a dashing lover to Skylar, a genius, a good friend, and a scared kid, and put these together and come up with a convincing character. And Damon does that without trouble. He had us all crying like babies in a certain particular scene. You here people say, ""Oh but Leonardo DiCaprio deserved to win the Oscar or at least get nominated."" To me there was no comparison at all. Matt Damon was clearly better than Leonardo DiCaprio. I thought that Matt Damon was even superior to Al Pacino who deserved a nomination for Donnie Brasco, and everyone knows I love Al Pacino.

Ben Affleck has a small but important part in the movie. I personally think that he deserved an Oscar nomination for this too. He gave a great, near perfect performance. You don't have to have someone acting like they don't have enough since to come in out of the rain to give a good performance, and the whole cast shows it here.

Stellan Skarsgard has an important role as the mathematician who ""discovers"" Will. It must have been heartbreaking for his character, Lambeau to know what true genius is, and appreciate true genius, but fall short of it himself. It must have been heartbreaking to watch an abused, high school dropout, cocky, 20 year old kid do math in a second that he was completely in the dark about. And it must have been most heartbreaking to watch Will almost throw it all away.

The script of this movie was such a surprise. It was written by two actors, not screenwriters, who wanted to find their big break. Instead of waiting until the perfect part came, they wrote themselves the perfect part. The result was the best screenplay of the year. I wouldn't hesitate to put it within the 5 best of the decade.

Jean Yves-Escoffier does a great job as the Director of Photography. He shoots it in a low key, dark, close-up style that works effectively. It captures the dark, moodiness of Boston.

Danny Elfman does great work on the score. He got nominated for an Oscar, but this being his first ""normal"" movie, and plus being against Titanic, didn't help. It's a shame, I wouldn't hesitate to say that no movie was more enhanced by a score last year than Good Will Hunting.

Gus Van Sant deserves credit for directing it. I've heard it compared to Dead Poets Society by saying, ""I didn't even shed a tear at Good Will Hunting, but there wasn't a dry eye in the theater when I saw Dead Poets Society."" Now that's a silly statement. That doesn't say anything about the quality of the movie. The difference is the directors. Peter Wier, who directed Dead Poets Society, is a sentimentalist, and Van Sant isn't. As one very good reviewer put it, ""Gus Van Sant refrains from beating the audience over the head during the emotional scenes."" That's exactly right. Peter Wier doesn't.

In my book, Good Will Hunting is one of the 10 best movies of all time. It's one of the modern classics in my book. And if there's any justice, it will be in everyone else's book too.

9 Oscar Nominations: (Picture, Director, Actor (Damon), Supporting Actor (Williams), Supporting Actress (Driver), Screenplay, Editing, Song, Score )

GRADE: A+ ****

The best movie of the year.

(NOTE: I would highly recommend this film to everyone, but beware - this film is quite liberal in its use of the most notorious four-letter word known to Hollywood. If you still don't know what I mean, think of Joe Pesci. If you *still* don't know what I mean, you're innocence is amazing, and this film would probably knock you for a loop. )",
29 August 1999,Excellent,"This movie is certainly one of the greatest I have seen in a long time. The screenplay, in particular, was nothing short of brilliant, and its Oscar was well-deserved. Robin Williams' performance as Sean Maguire was realistic and thoughtful, as was Matt Damon's performance as Will. I am being truthful when I say that I laughed and cried at this movie, and I don't often cry at movies.

Rating: 9/10

25 July 1999,Horrible!,"The fact that this film was nominated for Best Picture makes me sick to my stomach. The fact that this film was nominated for anything makes me sick. Every award this film was nominated for should have been a nomination for The Ice Storm instead. The Ice Strom was interesting and touching on so many levels and it was filled with brilliant performances. This film interested me in only one way; why the hell did so many people like it?

At the end of this film we are supposed to think that Will has learned something. Well I hate to break it you, but he's still an arrogant jerk. And Robin Williams, give me a break. The only good performance in this horrible movie was given by Stellan Skarsgard. Also, how can can script comprised of mostly the F-word win an Oscar?

14 July 1999,One of the best of the decade,"Good Will Hunting was a movie that had everything in it. Everything that makes a movie good. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do the greatest script ever wrote. By far the best dialouge in any movie I've seen. Well this and ""Pulp Fiction"". The acting was great also. It was an all around good movie with alot of meaning to it. It's almost even a coming of age sort of film. The whole friendship between Matt and Ben really paid off. You could tell in the movie that they were friends even off screen. Great acting by both of them and not to forget Robin Williams who does his best acting job yet. Even Will and Chuckie's friends were good actors. Ben's brother Casey did a great job and that other guy, I don't know his name, but he was in ""Dazed and Confused"", did a great job also. So if you're in the mood for a good movie about friendship and relationships, I highly recommend this movie.

9 August 1998,Great pic!,"This movie is very touching.There are a lot of very impressive dialogues especially the one when Sean and Will talked together in the park and the one where Will explained why he shouldn't work for the NSA.

1 October 1999,Amazing,"It still gets me every time when I see ""Good Will Hunting"". This movie is way more better than ""Titanic"". This movie should have won the Best Movie award at the Oscars. Everyone in the movie is amazing, my fellow swede Stellan Skarsg√•rd does also a good job. One of my favorite movie of all time. Good soundtrack too. 9/10

13 April 2021,OVERRATED,"What a cliche! Poor and genius boy is noticed by a rich man, but poor boy is proud because of things that are in his past and denies the modern world and the richness. But then magical things happen. Our genius but poor boy turns a winner. Then he thanks everybody for his great life. THE END.

I know, you see this scenario again and again. Here nothing is different. The only positive thing for this film is that it is well-acted. Nothing more...

26 December 2007,A layered and lucid film,"The film works because it manages to capture various shades of each character in an unforced manner through an intelligent script.Though the impossibility of the scenario depicted may make one apprehensive in the beginning,it is precisely that which allows the cast the unique opportunity to lend credibility to the film's script by their remarkably honest performances complemented by crackling dialogue which ranges from the witty,to the profound,to the meaningfully terse without being overly emphatic at any time.There are many things which have been handled with admirable sensitivity like the bond of friendship between the boys,how the healer(Sean)manages to reach out to Will who in turn makes an impact on him,the refreshing chemistry between Will and Skylar,how prof.Lambeau's personal fears,Will's troubled past and his vulnerability are brought out.Yet for all it's finer nuances,the story is told in such a simple and lucid manner that it holds one's attention even if one refuses to probe into them.I can go on and on about this layered film but i'd rather not because i would like the reader to watch this engaging film speak it's own language himself(or herself)and gather the joys of discovering it's subtleties.",10
4 July 2000,Good Will sure went Hunting to get this excellent movie,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make an enormously perfect debut with their screenplay. Truly written from the heart, GHW is one of the best movies ever written and unquestionably the best date/romance movie ever! The entire cast is phenomenal, there is nothing negative to be said about this movie. Movies like this are few and far between (this and L.A. Confidential were my picks for 1998' Best Pic.....too bad Titanic was in the same year)This is a movie that shows you don't need top-name stars and a million special effects to make a great movie that also packs an emotional wallop. Yeah, the ending is a little weak, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go out and rent it, I guarantee you will love it. Oh, by the way, Matt Damon's performance was also 10 times better than Jack Nicholson's....'cmon, anyone can play someone with OCD but not everyone can play someone from Southie and is a genius. But Matt Damon really is from Southie and he and Ben Affleck really are geniuses.....GWH proves it.

26 January 2009,Fantastic portrayal of life's outsiders,"Good Will Hunting is fantastic! A story written by Matt Damon and Ben Afleck which is a little mastermind that leaves you with a large smile at the end, after the emotional roller-coaster throughout. Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a mathematical genius and has potential that only one wishes to have, however there is real personal issues that has affected Will, stopping his own potential to be full-filled because of his life experiences growing up as a child. In more specific terms Will is like a terrified child who stays at home on his couch, so he doesn't have to go into the real world and feel the kind of hurt that has affected him before in life. Will hangs around with so called ""no brainers"" and his best friend Chuckie (Played by Ben Afleck) who is the type that really would lie in the middle of the road for Will we gradually begin to admire this genuine loyal friendship that in the middle class world seems to be rare for some people. Great sub-plot with therapist Sean Maguire (played by Robin Williams) which is like cat and mouse with each meetings they have. Will has always called the shots and kept in control of what he wants people to no and understand about him, but Sean is finally his match, and with great dialogue this kept me locked and fascinated throughout the film as i generally wanted to no more about Will and understand him! There is love in Will's life called Skylar (played by Minne Driver) and Skylar has everything charisma, looks, intelligence and a very sweet/caring side. Will struggles throughout being able to allow himself to love Skylar and become vulnerable for a women once in his life. Good Will hunting is a film that educates and provokes human ignorance for roughly 2 hours and definitely changes people perceptions of judging people who they truly don't understand!",10
27 July 2006,Must See!,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10
14 July 2002,Excellent AND Entirely Possible,"Despite the odd comments by one fellow here who claims to be a mathematician; This was not only an excellent movie but an entirely believable one. Not just believable but IMPORTANTLY so.

Contrary to our mad rush to find the minimal acceptable and attempt to improve the self image of the mediocre, Talent DOES exist. It could be, should be, thought of as the key attribute of man.

And truly talented people CAN teach themselves anything and everything - I learned early in life to use the word genius with caution, when a frustrated (and slightly jealous) teacher said to me as a precocious pre-teen ""It is not enough to be a genius (Very High IQ) you have to be a genius AT something"" - and that is true, so I will not describe Will as a genius but very talented. One salient point of the movie was Will's trave(ai)l from talent - IQ genius - to being a genius AT something. You know as he's driving off in the wonderful gift from Affleck (who I did think was very impressive, maybe a touch more than Matt) THAT was to become the quest, the search for his proper role / accomplishment / (and yes, contribution). Even though we are encouraged to think it is Mini Driver he seeks, it is himself and that ultimate of all, creative accomplishment (as mathematics can be as creative as sculpture and music).

This understanding and acknowledgement of original talent is also discouraged as we have turned `Education' into a self serving, institutionalized, industry that sells knowledge rather than disseminating it.

One of the best lines in the movie is when Will tells an imitation scholar student that he will eventually discover, if his parents haven't already, that they are spending thousands (hundreds of thousands) to teach him things that can be bought by a talented person with three dollars in overdue book fines from the library.

Perhaps that was what made it such a great movie for me, I've been there, all of it, South Boston and the hallowed halls on Mass Avenue.

I started sitting in college class rooms - auditing - while still a young teen. Had to play hooky from ridiculous `High' School to do it. In fact, I can even appreciate Will's `attitude' as today's society evermore dedicates itself to conformity and forcing same regardless of talent.

Made a pain-in-the-a!! of myself by correcting the professors and knowing the answers before anyone else. Never paid a dime in tuition (even ignoring a bill for campus parking in Cambridge) and got tested out as a Masters in Engineering (by a short lived program from the ASME that was undoubtedly squelched by academia because they weren't getting their piece of flesh).

I DO know whereof I speak, and the `mathematician' is just another one of those jealous of talent.

THIS IS A VERY GOOD, if not downright great, MOVIE!",

24 February 2002,It deserved the recognition it received,"This movie is definitely one of my favorites. I gave it an eight, but I really would like to give it an eight and a half. It deserved it. The acting is superb, and there aren't really any major blemishes in the film. This is a movie that almost anyone can enjoy. All ages should appreciate this film for what it is; a triumph. Really, this movie has it all, humor, drama, intensity, and romance. I suggest you rent this on DVD, because it contains around 9 gigabytes of info on it, which translates into a lot of extras.

15 June 2003,A film generating polemic,"I've seen the movie for the first time a few weeks ago. Curious about other people's opinion, I took a look on film's comments. Some people gave this film a very low rating. It's obvious why. If those people know the life from watching movies and TV shows, this movie means nothing. But if you go out there, living between real people on a daily basis, you realise the qualities of this film. Comparing it with another Hollywood movie, this film is crap. Comparing it with the real life, it is unbelievable true and exciting. If we analyse the qualities of a film by the amount of truth brought in from our day-by-day life, of course, if we really want to see life and not only ourselves every single moment, we realise how mach frustration can be hidden in an individual.

For those underrating the movie: you might very well be surrounded by trees, without knowing you're actually in a forest.

27 February 2018,Just a good willing movie.,I saw this movie 2 years ago so maybe I'm not in the right position to write about it. Truth is I remember a few things about what happened in this film. The story didn't work right for me. I felt like I was watching another film with Robin Williams who was playing the same role over and over again. For another time Williams was playing the good man of the story. Sure he did an excellent performance but its unfortunate that we didn't see this actor play a wide variety of roles before leaving this world for good. Mat Damon is an actor who I can't go along with him in almost any movie he ever played. Same goes with Ben Affleck. Their performances were ok for me but not Oscaw worthy. Same goes with the screenplay. Gus Van Sant did an alright work but nothing out of the ordinary at least for today. I don't know maybe this movie was a success because of it's time but nowadays it seems obsolete. Yes it has good dialogue and some awesome quotes and the ending is leaving you with a bittersweet taste in your mouth but I myself couldn't delve into the film's world. Now you can find a million of movies like this one. I know that it's a movie that inspired almost every other movie of this genre but still I can't consider it a masterpiece. A good movie but nothing out of the ordinary at least for me.,6
22 March 2019,By far one of my top 5 movies to date!!!,"This movie is in my top 5 possibly even top 3 because one people can relate to the story. Two the acting is initiated well. good flow maybe a little bit slow in the beginning but totally worth watching through! I hands down recommend this movie :)

12 February 1999,Genius? Possibly.,"I rented this movie not expecting it to live up to hype. I had not heard one person say a bad word about this film and they were absolutely right. Damon's character is complex and involving, sometimes even quite humorous. The on screen chemistry between him and Affleck is a joy to watch, Affleck being far less intelligent than Damon's character yet having more common sense and seeing that Will Hunting was just wasting himself is an interesting angle.

In my opinion, Robin Williams is one of the most under-rated serious drama actors, though gaining plaudits for his comedy work this is as good as his excellent role in 'Dead Poet's Society' and the dialogue between him and Damon is spectacular. It kept me interested throughout the film and brought sympathy to an arrogant character. The only element to keep this film from perfection was that Will Hunting's attitude change was perhaps too sudden, other than that a fine movie that I'd recommend to anyone who likes a good storyline.",9
27 August 2001,One of the best movies of the twentieth century.,"Without a doubt, Good Will Hunting can be considered one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. The writing was superb, the acting first rate, and the camera work brilliant. I consider myself to be a good judge of movies, and I've seen many classic films, and many really crappy ones. Good Will Hunting is definitely in my top five list (with a bullet!). It has everything that a moviegoer could want in a film, and just think, without this film, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck might never have become truly famous. Now that would have been a terrible crime! The two of them (in their finest performances to date)were so phenomenal along with the Oscar-winning performance of Robin Williams. After watching this film, I cried for hours. This film has the ability to touch people in a way that no other has been able to.

9 June 2006,Try to understand this ... please?,"1- It's a movie, you don't believe the plot lines? Welcome to Hollywood. For example: Do you think 8 guys would cross Europe & find Private Ryan? Of course not, but you've got to buy the basic premise folks. ANYTHING can and does happen IRL, why not this? (who cares if it is a Math Genius or a Stud athlete - hell both are rare, but how many 'sports stud' movie characters do we automatically accept?)

2- The REAL story within the story is not about the boy-girl relationship, or the buddy relationships. It is a man who finally realizes that another man knows what he's been through, GETS IT, and at the same time, has shown him that whining about it is not the solution. Robin William's character stands up to Damon's character in a way that nobody else ever has - and it works! Especially his ""I'll end you..."" line. (I was sitting in my seat thinking, ""Robin Williams might kill me"") I'm sure he'd never been made to believe that somebody would represent anything to him that strongly. THIS is the relationship in the movie that matters. Whether he makes it w/the girl or his buddies die by age 30 really is secondary.

3- Real life, sadly, involves less than perfect people who use less than perfect language. Sad, but true. Yeah, it was a bit much, but that's what Hollywood does. More people are jerks than are NOT jerks. They brought you down, and they brought Damon's character down, just like real life. So the point was made.

Bottom line? Enjoy it for what it is. A well told coming-of-age 'hope for the best in an imperfect world where you have both incredible strengths and weaknesses' kind of story. It is not a flawless story (name ONE?), but it made you care about some of the folks in it, which is more than most movies do. There ya go!",10
30 March 2007,Great film hunting,"Good Will Hunting gets a 10 out of 10. Very powerful and emotional film.

This was a great film for me , it touches you in so many ways and was done very , very well . Matt Damon is great as the naive , but honest and brilliant man who's a genius, with his own terms borne of an abusive upbringing .This movie hits you on multiple levels , injustice , truth , death , love , corruption , abusiveness . I can't say enough about it , I watched this movie in the theater and wept, it held me throughout .Mimi is brilliant as the student who gets to understand him. I was thoroughly entertained by this movie and I recommend it highly if you want to be hit where you live , or where i live , or where we live , yeah where we live . SEE IT !

17 March 2009,Tremendous!,"Good Will Hunting, the story of 4 Irish-Catholic boys in Boston circles around the relationship between them and in particular Will Hunting himself. A boy genius that has a troubled background, Will begins counseling with Sean, portrayed in one of the best performances of a generation by Robin Williams. They discuss many things about Will and his life. What will he do with it? Where will he go? All the while, Will is building a romantic involvement with a young college woman named Skylar. The choice in the end comes down to siding to change the world with his genius or to go to California and chase the woman of his dreams. Throughout these tough decisions Will learns about himself, life, and what is truly important in this word. Sometimes money is to some, sometimes love, sometimes neither. Will has options and has choices and this story uplifts the viewer to appreciate the little things in life and understand the complexity of a boy trying to find himself, like most do at that point in their lives.

23 January 2013,One of the best Independent Films of all time,"Hands down one of my favorite movies of all times. The intelligent writing from Matt and Ben makes this a classic and must have for any library.

Matt Damon and Robin Williams were the perfect duo for this film, and probably performed one of their best bodies of work each. This films manages to find emotional breakdown or breakthrough if you will, without losing the tough, sarcastic, street talk and mentality. Although there is an important female character, it does not carry the story or is primarily responsible Matt's character's motivation. Instead, this film is more about ALL aspects of life although Will Hunting does make a crucial final decision based around his girlfriend.

Great Movie with classic one-liners.

13 December 2005,Robin Williams' best performance?,"One of my all time favourite films, 'Good Will Hunting' portrays the trials and tribulations of a 20-something genius fighting to reconcile his talent and his lifestyle. Matt Damon is superb as the fresh-faced, insecure Will Hunting, and displays a striking sense of vulnerability beneath a rough, uncompromising exterior, particularly in the psychiatry scenes...which brings me to Robin Williams. Whilst I have occasionally thought that Williams can tend towards the cloyingly sentimental, his performance here as Will's psychiatrist is truly towering, which was acknowledged by a 'best supporting' Oscar. Peter Sasgaard (think that's how you spell it!) is also worth a mention, with an excellent performance an unlikable, but ultimately well-intentioned professor. Minnie Driver also stars in a nicely portrayed, if somewhat limited role.

9 July 2016,A Great Movie that Should be Watched by Everyone.,"Good Will Hunting is a movie about Will Hunting, a misunderstood poor boy from South Boston, who has a genius-level IQ and works as a janitor at a university. He solves a near-impossible math problem that takes professionals years to master, and is given the offer to be one of the smartest mathematicians ever, but after getting in a fight with a police officer, he is sent to Dr. Sean Maguire to have therapy sessions. What starts as a reluctant bonding session turns into a budding friendship that changes his world.

For one, let me talk about the story behind this film. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon both starred and wrote this movie, (both of them unknown at the time) and ever since then, it's one of the most successful indie films of all time.

I think everyone should watch this movie. I say that about a lot of films but this time I mean it. It gives older adults a look at what a teenager/college student's life is like, and it gives younger viewers a look at what to expect, and a guide to surviving it.

Not only that, but all the actors and actresses do an amazing job. Most people know Robin Williams as a funny actor, but this is his best and most serious role. He's better as a serious actor then a comedy actor in my opinion. Sort of like how Jim Carrey was good in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and those are all serious flicks.

Seriously, check this film out. Definitely mandatory viewing for everyone.",9
10 May 2008,a movie for all time....,"""If you wish others to believe in you, you must first convince them that you believe in them"".....a quote which is apt for describing the soul of the movie.... The movie surprises me every time i see it with the sheer depth of the story and strength in each of the characters... it is probably the most defining role of Robin Williams after patch adams and his portrayal of sean is stunning... Matt Damon playing the bad-boy-genius with the fragile mix of lightheartedness and hidden sadness is worth watching and his role is quite beautifully supported by his buddies portrayed by the afflecks and Cole Hauser and also Damon's love interest Skylar (minnie driver)....

the directive effort of gus van sant is quite brilliant with the way in which he deals with the characters...expressing their very depths...in most times through long shots with hardly any dialogue

I would recommend the movie as a must watch ..... u probably have to buy a copy for posterity...:)",10
8 November 2019,One of the best films ever made.,"This film is mindblowing, the script is jaw droping and most definitely deserved the oscar, the story is simply jaw droping and is an excellent instalment of classic cinema. Easily one of Damons most compelling persormance yet, but I do think Afflecks performance is just as good and that he doesn't get given enough credit.

Overall, this is a timeless classsic - A+

8 January 2023,A Truly Unique Masterpiece,"This movie made me think about things I never thought about before. I'd like to write more but I gotta go see about a girl. Here's the lyrics to my favourite song instead.

Now the pale morning sings of forgotten things She plays a tune for those who wish to overlook The fact that they've been blindly deceived By those who preach and pray and teach But she falls short and the night explodes in laughter But don't you come here and say I didn't warn you About the way your world can alter And oh how you try to command it all still Every single time it all shifts one way or the other And I'm a goddamn coward, but then again so are you And the lion's roar, the lion's roar Has me evading and hollering for you And I never really knew what to do Now I guess sometimes I wish you were a little more predictable That I could read you just like a book For now I can only guess what's coming next By examining your timid smile And the ways of the old, old winds blowing you back 'round And I'm a goddamn fool, but then again so are you And the lion's roar, the lion's roar Has me seeking out and searching for you And I never really knew what to do Sometimes I wish I could find my Rosemary Hill I'd sit there and look at the deserted lakes and I'd sing And every once in a while I'd sing a song for you That would rise above the mountains and the stars and the sea And if I wanted it to it would lead you back to me And the lion's roar, the lion's roar Is something that I have heard before A children's tale, the lonesome wail of a lion's roar.",10
2 December 2009,deeply touching and motivating,"this is one of the movies which has inspired me deeply. In some way or the other way this movie depicts the life of people who because of their repression defense mechanism are not able to achieve what they ought to achieve if they haven't repressed their abilities and i was instantly able to attach myself with the character of will hunting as i have myself repressed my abilities so as to run away from people's eyes. But after watching this movie i am deeply enthralled and also motivated to fight inner demons of fear in me and to emerge as a person i am and which i am ought to be .Thanks for Ben Affleck and Matt Damon to bring such a script which is so touching and a path finder for people who are making their abilities go redundant just because of some stupid psychological problem

30 October 1998,"Hype not justified, but not a bad movie","I just don't see why this movie was such a popular hit, not to mention an Oscar contender for best picture. Granted, the story was original and deserving of some credit, but not exactly the claimed ""shot in the arm of originality"" the industry needed. It is a joy to watch, filled with many humorous moments. The explicit swearing doesn't take away from the movie; rather, it adds to regional aura the audience is meant to feel from South Bostonites. That joke that Skylar tells about the old couple is the funniest I've heard in a long time. One of the movie's funniest jokes was also the ""How about them apples?"" line, so it's not as if the movie was one total raunch fest. However, the story was a tad predictable. The way the story jolts us is what is the foundation of its popularity. The characters also are an utter pleasure, but I think Ben Affleck's character Chucky was unnecessary and kind of stupid. It's a shame too, because Ben Affleck is a truly gifted actor -- he showed his true talent in Chasing Amy. Matt Damon was okay, but hardly a Best Actor contender. I think the real underrated talent was Minnie Driver. Her character was intriguing, and made believable by a winning performance. The fact that she lost to a talent-less Kim Basinger at the Academy Awards boggles the mind. Overall, not bad. I'll probably watch it again.",
15 January 1999,Thought-provoking!,"This is a very serious, thought-provoking, and somewhat improbable psycho-drama. A little romance, much anger, some violence, many memorable lines, and way too much profanity. Is that what life's really like in South Boston?

5 March 2005,"GWH as a case-study in saving a non-active ""protagonist""","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed.

6 September 2004,How do you like them apples?,"I really enjoy watching this film, and it is one of the very few films that I think I could get to the end of it and actually stand to go straight back to the beginning and watch it all over again.

Whether it is intentional or not, this film runs far deeper than it appears to. The fact that Will (Matt Damon) is a brilliant mathematician and incredibly intelligent is not what is important, and for me it is not the drive of the film. Too many people pick at the plot holes concerning Will's ""gifts"" and it spoils their interpretations of the film. Will's genius is simply an intriguing aspect that provides foundations for what I think is more complexity.

What this film does is embrace the fact that there is nothing more important in life than other people. Will represents a safe path, a life that so many of us choose to live because we feel comfortable. Sean (Robin Williams) and Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) represent two paths out of safety and into something that is ultimately more worthwhile. Sean encourages a life encompassed by love, intimacy and experience, while Lambeau represents a life immersed entirely in intellectual achievement and the social high ground. One of these paths is, while incredibly gratifying, essentially empty, whereas the other is entirely fulfilling.

This film helps us understand that we can't learn everything about life from books. Life is about the precious little experiences that are personal to us, that really matter, that touch our hearts or make us think. It is about experiencing the little imperfections in people that make them beautiful only to you. And throughout life, it is important that we follow our hearts and do what we truly want to do, and not what society expects of us.

Ultimately, like so many films, Good Will Hunting is about love. But it conveys the emotion in ways that are more subtle, and beyond the boundaries of oozy sentimentality that few films bother to cross.

How do I like them apples? I like them a lot.",

22 July 2001,Real life,"i have read at least 60 other reviews for this movie. i smiled at the good, and twitched at the bad. i do believe that everyone has the right to express their opinion, but some people get out of hand. one review said that Matt and Ben did not write the script, they did write the main script, but may have had help with editing. Several reviewers don't even know the names of the writers. in my opinion, Good Will Hunting would've won Best Picture had it been released only a week later, putting it in 1998. readers of this review are probably thinking that i am some over-obsessed teeny-bopper. in some ways i am. i do think that ben and matt are ""hotties"". but that it not the reason that GWH is my favorite movie. i read the screenplay. i pictured the scenes as matt and ben may've pictured them. i recited the lines. i laughed at the jokes. i read background information, such as how they wrote it, why they wrote it, and why they cast the people they cast. i looked past the swearing, past the reviews, i saw the raw screenplay. all i had was that.

my copy of Good Will Hunting is barely one week old and has been watched in full, only 3 times. in those 3 times, however i have looked deeper. i looked at the actors, i listened to their dialogue, i watched their actions, i connected with the characters. many people were offended at the language, because it is real. not hollywood real, but really real. parents shield their children from ""four letter words"", yet they will let them walk out the door. the purpose of this review is not to yell at those who hated it, it is to convince them, look deeper. the purpose of the movie is to make people aware of how young men spend their time, how real people talk. Ben Affleck does not over exaggerate his movements, he does what he would naturally do. Good Will Hunting is more fact than fiction, the diologue, the people, the actions, they are are real. the plot was made up. in conclusion, i would like to say that only those true to boston can do a boston accent. and only an idiot would overlook this movie, or to label it ""over pulicized"". give Will a chance, i guarantee that if you look at the heart, you will find it entertaining. Good Will Hunting gets 10/10 and Matt and Ben get my respect. Have a nice day! KD",

13 July 2012,I cried.,"Now it is very rare that I give a film 10/10 because I believe that no film can be 'perfect' - but for the first time I believe I have found a genuine 10.

Featuring two of my favourite actors, Matt Damon and Robin Williams, I was already optimistic about the film and the acting did not disappoint. Everything the actors did and said was so suitable to their characters and it was clear that they had an overwhelming understanding of the characters they were playing.

The plot was thoughtful but in no way slow. It contained that balance that all great films need of comedy, romance, drama, friendship and raw emotion. This balance was so well distributed that it meant one could cry (as I did) at an emotional scene but could then be comforted by a later scene with some comedy.

The film is one of absolute brilliance, which teaches an important lesson about life. It will go down as a classic in my books. I've seen a lot of films - and I mean a lot - but this will forever hold a place in my 5 all time favourite films.

A must see for anyone and everyone.",10
12 May 2001,Great Movie!,"Although not a family movie, this is one of the greatest flicks in modern times. Don't look for big special effects, a big soundtrack, or a historical backdrop. This is a gritty film that is well written and well made. To me, Matt Damon will always be Will and Ben Affleck will always be Chuck and this will always be their best roles. That is not to undercut the great performances of Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser. The classic lines that come from this movie will live on forever with some of its true fans. Robin Williams does a fine job in one of his more low key performances. Other supporting cast members also stand out. Once you see this movie, you will either love it or hate, but you will come away with a few (if not more) memorable, well-written, well-acted scenes. For the well-rounded movie viewer, it is a must!

15 July 2003,Awesome Dialog,"Saw this for the second time last night. I liked it pretty good the first time, but liked it even more on the second viewing. Perhaps I was let down a little when I saw it the first time after all the hype? Anyway, on my second viewing, I really noticed the incredible dialog between Robin Williams and Matt Damon's character, most of which was delivered by Robin Williams. Superior stuff. Mr. Williams, you are far better at drama than comedy!!! In fact, it is so good, I really have a hard time believing that the same talent that produced Dogma wrote the dialog in this movie! I think there must have been some assistance on this part.

I even thought Affleck did a pretty good job in one place, which I missed the first time. At the end of the movie, when Ben's character goes by Matt's character's home to pick him up for work, and Matt is not there, you can actually see the light bulb come on ... very slowly ... while watching Ben. Well done.

Cool story. I don't know what it is referred to in a story, script, or screenplay, but I am noticing it more and more, and it occurs in this movie too. What I am referring to is when something is explained in one context earlier in the movie so that it is more fully understood later in the movie, usually for a very emotional purpose. In this movie, some of William's brilliantly rendered dialog concerns telling his buddies he has to ""see about a girl"" when meeting his future wife for the first time, instead of seeing game 6 of the World Series. This dialog is very emotional. So, later, when Matt uses the same line, all is understood with little said. Elegant. Same concept was used in Rock Star concerning ""taking a pi$$"". But, the best I have ever seen this done was on the last Cheers episode that Shelly Long was on when Dianne and Sam were saying goodbye. She supposedly was only leaving for a few months. He says ""Have a good life."" She explains that he says that as though they will never see each other again, which we know to be the reality as does Sam, though he won't admit it. She has explained the meaning of the phrase to us the viewer. She asserts, she will be back. After she is out of earshot, Sam says again ""Have a good life"" letting us know the finality of their relationship. One of the best pieces of dialog I have ever seen!

But, back to GWH, I think it is a very good movie, and well worth watching. Very impressive for them (Ben and Matt) to have done.",
20 April 2003,"A great amount of respect for this simple, yet profound work","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve a lot of credit for this movie. One reason they painted such an excellent portrayal of life as it really is or could be, may be attributed to their youth. Youth facilitated this film with universal themes of the transformation from youth to adult, and to balance the rebelling nature of Will Hunting, Robin Williams adds (with a very well developed character) the humbled but wiser soul of an older man. Even though Will being so naturally gifted at math seems a little out of the ordinary, it is supposed to be this way. The movie takes this abnormality and uses it to make everyone realize how much like Will they are. Math may not be your strong point or your weak point either, but this characteristic of Will is simply an example of a trait that could cause any type of tension or problems in the life of a person. I especially love how Williams' character is written into this same theme so that personalities young and old clash. This is one of few movies that can truly move me emotionally every time I see it, and it is because it can be related to every human that ever lived.

31 January 2012,Look closer!,"It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER.",9
7 August 2017,Great film,"This is the best movie I have seen since the Godfather. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make a great team...not only as actors, but more impressively as co-writers. Add Robin Williams in perhaps his best role ever (too close to Good Morning Vietnam for me to make the call), and you have a wonderfully entertaining movie.

Ben Affleck is convincing as the best friend to a genius, able to effectively play the joker and the friend who would ""lay down in traffic for you"". Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired (except maybe a beard trimmer...).

The most amazing thing about this movie is the writing. Even if the acting were not terrific, this movie still would have made my top ten list. I was captivated from beginning to end.

If you've not seen it, Good Will Hunting is without doubt a ""renter"", and I think after seeing it, it's one you'll want to own to watch again and again.",9
11 May 2004,Definitely worth watching,"I've noticed that this movie has received some harsh criticism. First of all, if you watch the movie and pay any attention, you can see that the story does make sense, and the casting works (I don't think they ever mentioned anything about an Irish gang). Is the story believable? Maybe. But the writing is good enough that it can get you to think, which is important. Also, any movie that can get such strong feelings from viewers, good or bad, has made an important statement.

The acting, particularly Robin Williams, is definitely top notch. If Ben Affleck could find half that level of integrity again, he might have a new lease on his career. This was the movie that (in my eyes at least) really established Matt Damon as an actor that could hold a movie almost singlehanded. And, while I'm not often a big Minnie Driver fan, her stark contrast to Matt Damon's character definitely livened up the movie. I can never really tell if the Academy picks them right. But I do know that this was a good movie. It doesn't weigh you down with anything especially sappy or depressing. It just tries to tell a story.",8
19 September 2005,Definitely worth watching again,"They don't make these kinds of movies anymore. This one had a lot of heart and wasn't pretending to be 'cool'. I get so sick of Hollywood glamour in movies today. There's not enough heart and soul like 'Good Will'. We need more movies that talk about the human spirit instead of spitting on it. Hollywood has become a frat boy house where no one cares about where we're going in the human race. No one cares period. They just want to make money and have their little power struggles. What made this a non-Hollywood movie was the genuine feel of Matt Damon and Robin Williams - nothing glamorous, just real interaction. Definitely cried in the end like everyone else. Amazing movie that deserved the Oscars. Highly Recommend.

30 April 2006,Best motion picture!!!!!! Of every year,"Hi, i am Sam Radseresht. When i first saw this movie, i thought it was the film with the most bad language in the universe. But then, i looked at it again and again. And in the end, it practically became an obsession. I admired Robin's character Sean so much that i even wanted to be a therapist. I put books all over my room, read them, and studied hard in school. The film was truly a strong inspiration to my life, and i do want to take the opportunity to thank Robin Williams, for making his character so believable and real. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for writing their wonderful screenplay that consisted of so many beautiful words of knowledge. Gus van Sant for making it possible and my mum for buying it a our local Virgin. So, if you wan't a movie of speech, excitement and emotion, Godd Will Hunting is the best so far. Even if you may not be a fan of Matt, Ben, Robin or any other cast members, please do watch it for they certainly deserve a big applaud.

It is one of those movies that will catch and touch your heart. A sea of Emotion. And in the end, there is a message for us all, but that is for you to find out. It focuses on Will Hunting (Damon) and how his troublesome past has left him isolated and off his path. When he is mopping the floors of MIT tech (boston), a teacher recognizes his astonishing talent and works with his math studies. Problem is, Will does not want that, and the Maths teacher cant understand his problem. So, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) teaches Will to not be afraid, and realize to not waste his talent but use it. Together, they discover their resolutions and reveal their secrets.

But what strikes me about this movie is everything. If i was to find one word to describe watching this movie,,,..... Impossible. It just takes quite a lot to describe it. When i watched it, there was one scene that was so emotional, i could feel goosebumps on my skin and water in my eyes. A heartening experience, powerful and remarkable acting. SEE IT NOW. IT IS MORE THAN A FILM!!!!!!",9
18 September 2021,Simplicity at its finest,"That one scene gets me every time, amazing performances by Matt Damon and Robin Williams, even by Will's friends, the chemistry between Damon and Affleck really shines through. Who would've thought you could learn so much about life from a film.

12 April 2007,good friends,"I really enjoyed the originality of this film when it first came out. I liked they idea of a boy genius from Boston, Go RED SOX! I think the story was interesting and worked really well. There were a lot of little nuances, like the Dunken Donuts coffee, and the interaction between the friends that made this film great. Ben Afflec and Matt Damon had great chemistry; maybe it is because they were such close friends in real life. All the acting was really great. The accents were priceless. I'm glad that Robin Williams was finally able to get an Oscar because he is really great actor and he totally deserved it. This film made me wish I was better at math, seems very lucrative. I think this film is great because all the people seem real and their lives aren't thrilling but you really feel for the characters. I found this movie extremely entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone.

31 July 1998,Extremely heart-warming,"Good Will Hunting was extremely heart-warming. The story of a genius from the wrong side of the tracks really captures your heart. Matt Damon was terrific in the title role, as was the rest of the cast. This movie was truly deserving of it's Oscar nominations and, in my opinion, was better than Titanic.

6 May 2023,Pretentious,"A shallow movie about a ""troubled"" genius who is helped by another troubled genius.

The characters are just full of stereotypes in their behaviour, and there is some show off involved about how brilliant the person is.

In real life, even geniuses don't just pick up a notebook and solve things. Even they have to study and learn, just that it comes easier to them.

I also felt the life story was very linear - get found, get fixed, live happily ever after. Real life involves a lot more grey areas.

Acting wise, everyone is good. But the tedium of watching scenes unfold in a linear manner and see the main character getting 'fixed' made for a flat viewing experience.

One last thing - the psychiatrist says so much about falling in love and how it's not about looks, but knowing each other's imperfections. But when we reach the point where he tells his story, it's just a love at first sight type.

10 November 1998,High Concept college movie,"Good Will Hunting is an enjoyable look at life through the eyes of two screenwriters who seem upset at the lack of recognition for the talent they feel they have. It follows the three act high concept paradigm ( or formula ) to the letter. Act.1 Introduce the Character Act.2 Put the Character through a test Act.3 Watch the character redeem himself. The film is a metaphor for the lives of Affleck and Damon. Two kids that feel they are talented actors / filmmakers who haven't been recognised, dream about 'what if we could prove ourselves to be more talented than those with better credentials.' If we could beat the MIT maths professor without having to study. The irony is that they did prove it, they won an Oscar. This film is basically Top Gun set in academia.

8 January 2000,Shows off Damons abilities,"The acting in this movie was amazing. Damon and Williams together especially were great. I had two major problems with this movie though. The character Skylar was not truly needed in the story. Meaning Will did not really need to have a love intrest to make the story better. I also was very turned off by the amount of cursing. That amount was not needed at all. Overall an excellent movie, for newcomers

1 August 2020,A master piece that will wake you up,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10
11 December 1999,Great Flick,"In a year of the ultimate high budget film, Titanic, Good Will Hunting was at the very least a breath of fresh air. With it's budget a miniscule fraction of the Oscar winning best picture, Gus Van Sant and the writers, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, produced a picture with much more substance and emotion than any other movie that year. Critics have questioned the reality of this film. Is it so hard to believe that there is a kid genius from the slums of South Boston? As far as I'm concerned, the critics must be appalled at the idea that someone without a Harvard education could be so successful and so intelligent. Get over this fact, and get over this part of the movie. In all likelihood, the fact that he is a genius isn't the most important element in the film.

This film is about one's life education and about one's growth as a person. As it turned out, this film was extremely entertaining, especially with the thick Boston accents, which in my opinion, only made the movie all the more believable.

4 October 1998,"One of, if not the best movie ever made.","Good Will Hunting is one of the most beautifully written, directed, and acted movies there has ever been. I've read the screenplay and seen the movie numerous times, and I can tell you that there has never been a more original film. My love of this film is one of the reasons that I hate Titanic so much. Good Will Hunting deserved all of the Academy Awards that it was nominated for, more even. It was one of the happiest moments of my life when I saw Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Robin Williams accepting their Oscars. No one has ever deserved them more. I feel sorry for Minnie Driver though. She deserved her Oscar much more than Kim Basinger did. Kim was barely in any of L.A. Confidential, while Minnie was one of the most important characters. They all deserve Oscars.

20 September 1998,Good Will Hunting was the best picture of 1997!,"I liked Titanic, but it was a silly film when compared to Good Will Hunting. This movie was so emotional and moving. It was still on my mind three weeks after I first saw it. The script was original, and the acting was beyond phenomenal. Good Will Hunting should have won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1997.

10 November 2021,Great film but unpredictable ending.,"I love the slow build-up and character development, unfortunately the ending is just unpredictable as the chance of winning of a lottery ticket. Though I do wish for a happy ending for the main character, unfortunately this is a hanging future I have to live with, hence the less than perfect score.

24 April 2002,"Understated, Overwhelmed","I saw this film the other day, and was totally overwhelmed by the sheer simplicity of it. All the guys in it are brilliant - even Robin Williams,and I am not a RW fan - and it has been crafted in such a believable, unschmaltzy way that your emotions are knotted up around it before you even realise. The plot is resolved in such an understated fashion that you end up far more contented at the finish than you would have with some cheesy, climatic reunion. The drama in this film is so silently compelling that I defy anyone to watch it without feeling some empathic emotion.

20 November 2003,A brilliant script. A genius.,"The movie is a brilliant script that I hear Matt Damon wrote for a English class when he was in college.

Mysteriously I always missed the movie when it was on television, and it was played several times. I would watch just the start and miss the rest each time due to some or the other reason. Finally I watched it in whole now on 21st Nov 2003.

Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a genius for whom most of mumbo-jumbo math and O-chem is ""just a joke"". He works as a janitor in MIT and solves a problem written on the board in the passage he mops. He is discovered by Prof. Gerry who gets him out of jail (assault charges) on two conditions 1) Will Hunting works with Prof. Gerry 2) He sees a therapist.

Will has a tough shell around him which he doesn't let anyone crack open and trespass. He is cocky, abusive and least bit considerate towards Prof. Gerry's attempts at polishing him into a Genius who can be of use than a Genius who just ends up being a construction worker all his life. Enter Robin Williams and the rest is for you to watch. Must watch.

Robin Williams plays his role so well that you forget you are watching a movie, you forget he is an actor and not a professor or a psychologist. This happens to me each time I watch a Robin Williams film. The sessions that Robin Williams and Matt Damon have are some of the best parts of the movie and the last session where Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) finally succeeds in opening up Will Hunting is the best scene of the movie.

The character of Will hunting seems to be complex but it is not really. Why would a genius not want to work for some big company or the US Defence and make millions or billions? Why does he just wanna be what he is? And it frustrates you as the viewer, while ur trying to find the key that would open him up. Ur frustrated waiting for him to stop being so arrogant, why the hell can't he be a bit 'nice' to these guys? Ur trying to be a detective, and trying to find the great reasons. And that is how the script brings a mild suspense and tension to itself, mild.

Minnie Driver, the English girl is an amazing actress. She is such a normal girl, who laughs loud and can still be gentle and she is very smart too, and vulnerable. U think why is Ben Affleck doing whatever he is doing in the movie. Ben Affleck answers this question brilliantly in a scene that works as a catalyst in the transformation of Will Hunting's character. Stellan Skarsg√•rd (Prof. Gerald Lambeau) who takes up the challenge of refining the Gold ore that he mined shows great patience. One would really feel for him and his passion for math, especially if ur a lover of math.

This is one of the best stories and a very well sketched script. Go get a DVD.",8
1 August 2003,An excellent feel good film...,"This drama features great acting, storytelling, and direction. Though the story may be somewhat familiar and predictable, the actors draw you into their lives and characters so that we care about what happens to them. This is an excellent feel-good film!...10/10.

25 September 2014,The best movie I've ever seen,"This movie hits it out of the ballpark for me. First off all, the script is absolutely incredible. Affleck and Damon have written an amazing story that compares to no other and really tugs at your heartstrings without, in any way, being soppy, gushy, or unrealistic. Yes, there is a lot of profanity, but that is real life! People swear! If you look past the four-letter-words, you'll be able to see all this movie has to offer.

The acting is also incredible. Robin Williams was stunning in his performance as Sean. I had never seen him do a serious role before I saw this film, and he blew me away with his talent. Matt Damon also shines.

The movie is completely compelling and absolutely beautiful. And, I don't often cry during movies, but the scene where Will breaks down crying in Will's arms really gets me. Honestly, it's my favorite scene I've ever seen in any movie.

6 May 2015,Wonderful vehicle for every actor involved,"Good Will Hunting is a wonderfully paced, highly engaging drama that focuses on each character with painful emotional authenticity. I mean, literally, painful. The human struggles facing Matt Damon and Robin Williams' characters are so universal and beautifully realized. Every man must face one of their points of view, at some point. The hurt that Robin portrays is touching, sad and moving. You never see his wife. He just reminisces of her and it couldn't have felt more real. The subtleties in Robin's performance in this film are breathtaking as he laughs, cries and has his patience pushed over the edge.

I really cannot imagine a better filmmaker to direct this picture than Gus van Sant. The way in which he portrays the troubled gifted young man, Will Hunting, cannot only be seen in this film, but in Elephant, as well. His ability to direct young talent is seen in the handling of Matt Damon as a new actor; the fearlessness with which he tackled demanding emotional close-ups and expressive subtlety is remarkable. The plot setup is traditional, yet flawless, with a slow reveal of more dense emotional conflicts in an eventual, memorable series of climactic peaks involving Will's closest acquaintances.

Structurally, I do not think Good Will Hunting breaks any new ground. That is fine. If you are expecting a new type of storytelling or narrative formula, don't.

Any lack of narrative experimentation is completely overshadowed by the powerful performances provided by every single cast member, except for Ben Affleck. Nothing personal, I actually like him, but, in this film, he is still clearly a new actor with potential to be achieved. He undoubtedly holds the reigns on one of the single most emotionally charged moments of the film, but, just doesn't shine in my opinion. Affleck is perfectly likable and I would say he was well cast - I don't think his chops were quite on Damon's level yet, though, which only became obvious in the latter half of the film.

The tension of everyone's intellect crashing together is a real treat. Typically, this kind of heightened drama is based on violence or stunts, but, the way Good Will Hunting carries its highly taut narrative is through the intellectual conflicts amongst some very smart characters, not through empty spectacle. It was nice to see the love interest as a highly educated equal to the male lead and not a damsel-in-distress. She challenges Will emotionally and intellectually, something he is not used to in his even closest of relationships. You can understand everyone's point of view whether you disagree with them or not.

Damon, Williams, and Skarsgard's roles are highly charged and particularly well executed. They all deserve major recognition for their acting talent in this film.",9
1 June 2016,A young man's fascinating and complex journey to find himself,"Ben Affleck and Matt Damon wrote and starred in the film, ""Good Will Hunting"" which put them on the map in Hollywood. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting a brilliant young man working as a janitor at MIT in Boston. One day while cleaning he stumbles upon a equation that had been given to graduate students as a challenge. He is able to solve the problem and gains the interest of a professor. Even though Will is brilliant he is from a poor part of the Boston suburbs and has some trouble with the law. After an altercation with a police officer the professor tries to help Will achieve his potential by steering him in the right direction. As part of the deal Will must see a therapist played by Robin Williams. During therapy sessions Will learns about himself and deals with his past. Along the way he falls in love and struggles to determine what is important to him. The acting in this film is superb. Robin Williams won the academy award for best supporting actor. This film also won an Oscar for best writing screenplay. I love this film because it showcases the complexity of life and ones life is made up of choices.

26 April 2016,Best Movie Ever Written!,"At first the story centers around Will Hunting (Matt Damon) who is a brilliant young man and his struggles in life. Then we are introduced to a wonderful cast whom are only the best, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and Stellan Skarsg√•rd. What you will enjoy the most it'll be the humor, the well-written dialogs, the passion, and even the emotions come off the screen. Only showing what would happen in reality, allowing us to see how others feel and go on in life, while still having some awkward moments and mature language (only us adults understand). As always genius Robin Williams demonstrates that you don't need to be over-dramatic, but have a piece of both fun and seriousness.

In conclusion, well ‚Äì If you really think that your life is worthless then renew yourself in this movie. It is very inspiring ‚Äì Life is too short to throw it all away. Definitely recommended to everyone!

16 September 2005,"Wow, what a beautiful film!!!","I was amazed by this film. A story of a young man ,who has a brilliant mind, but finds it easier to use his fists in any situation. I was very engrossed by this film, especially when Damon, the main character and Williams, his psychiatrist have sessions together, discussing Hunting's painful past.The romance between Minnie Driver's character and Matt Damon's is very gentle, which helps the audience to relate t them as characters. The only thing I objected to was the amount of unnecessary use of swearing. Swearing is often used for dramatic impact and effect or to portray the society in which a film is set , but I found the fact that every other word was a swear word quite off putting and useless. Other than that I found the film enjoyable and humorous in just the right places. My favourite part is the scene with Williams and Damon where both men embrace and Damon's emotional barrier is cracked, allowing him to be liberated from his brutal past. Affleck's part is easily as important as Hunting's friend. Such sensitivity. What a beauty!!!!!!!!

15 November 2014,"Truly, a film that deserves the praise it's received.","I've been a fan of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for several years, and Robil Williams has been number one, as far as I'm concerned in everything he's done. This film from the beginning gripped my full attention. It's as if the three stars referenced above really weren't actors in the film. It was real life. No one would be noticed if they tried to redo this film. Life today is very hard, and scenes as depicted here are probably common. Every one in a while it's a good thing to try to convey to the public that we're all alike and from time to time show a glimpse of the extraordinary in their lives, but can't seem to get their message out. Here, Matt Damon, is an example of someone like this. He's fortunate to receive the help he needs. It's not easy, as the film shows, but Robil Williams is the one (that everyone of us needs) who finally breaks thru to truly help someone who is Good, Will Hunting.

They don't make movies like these anymore. Why? It comes from the heart that what makes this film so compelling. Movies today are cheaply written and made. They cater to the lowest common demoninator of people in our live lives not worthy of anything. See this movie and it will enlighten you. Definitely worth watching a second and third time. Highly recommend renting it on DVD. Good premise and storyline. The location was also excellent in Boston. See this film! It is a must-see and deserved all the Oscars.

26 November 2005,just a great film... every time!,"This is one of those films, no matter how many time you watch it, it never goes dull.

To cut this short, when you watch it for the first time, make sure you are alone or with only other film freaks! Then watch it again with the deleted scenes added and then AGAIN! with commentary added.

The Bar scene is a winner, where we get to meet Miss Drivers character, Skylar. I have tried Will's chat up line myself, but with no joy!

Also, i heard that the Dog Track scene, mini Driver actually placed a bet on the dog that won the race in the film, hence a smile on camera that cant not be staged!

30 December 1998,True Character. . .,"Good Will Hunting is not about twist endings, drawn-out action scenes, or even a sappy romance. It has been knocked for being too predictable and trying to hard to pull the heart strings of its audience. . .

Both are true.

Still, the main reason this may be one of the best movies of the 90's is the deep, moving characters that Gus Van Sant has created. The characters YOU know.

Each and every character is someone I know or can relate too. The genius who isn't living up to his potential. The man who has based everything he is on the woman he loved. The people who see the magic in someone, and can't stand to let it go to waste. Even the professor's assistant, the wonder kid whose been knocked of the top rung by a new wonder kid, I can relate to.

Let it be known that the movie is going to turn out *exactly* the way you want it to. And let it be known that you'll probably have a tear in your eye before the credits roll. . .

I wouldn't have it any other way.",10
11 May 2002,A good editor away from being a masterpiece!,"I like the way I felt after I finished watching this film. Not in a happy Hollywood ending kind of way, more of a contented put my feet up thing. These days it seems that a film is either transparently contrived as a money making vehicle, pretentiously aimed at being an art piece or just plain bad! It was nice to see an excellent story done in an above average way! My only regret is that a few scenes were not left on the editing room floor. For example why was the ""don't masturbate in my moms room scene there"". Not because of the subject matter but because A: it wasn't interesting or well done and B: It had no connection with anything else that happened. It could have replaced with another interaction scene between Damon and Driver so that when all the, ""I love you's"" started flying around I wasn't left scratching my head and thinking, already! You may think I didn't like this flick. Wrong, it was excellent and I give it a nine!

21 September 1998,Greatest movie to come along in a long time...,"I vehemently disagree with anonymous from Vancouver, Canada. Good Will Hunting truly shines in our lackluster times of modern Hollywood movies. Matt Damon reminds me of Pacino of the 70's. He is a young and a very talented actor that can hypnotize his audience almost at will. This movie could not have been successful without the supporting cast of Williams and Affleck. Driver may not be the ""Cameron Diaz"" but she is certainly a talented actress. The scene at the lake with Robin Williams' ""uncut"" extended performance is just jaw-dropping. The amount of depth in the character development and the complexities of the plot spun by this movie is just simply amazing and sensational. This movie is an exclamation point. Good Will Hunting stood out from the crowd without a question. Overall, I love this movie and would recommend it to everyone.

It was refreshing to view a movie, that no matter how unrealistic, still pulled at your heartstrings. Come on, twenty-something is almost as bad as Junior High. Watching the movie made me think that maybe I wasn't the only one questioning life in general. If it didn't make you think for just one nano-second, then I'm sorry. You totally missed something...

15 December 2007,Spectacular cast for a spectacular movie,"If asked who Ben Afleck and Matt Damon are most people would probably know that one of them once dated Jennifer Lopez and the other now has a series of successful 'Bourne' action movies. They may also know that both are regular stars or cameos in Kevin Smith movies.

What they may not know is that whilst still in their mid-twenties they wrote and produced one of the best 'finding yourself' movies of our generation.

Good Will Hunting is the story of Will Hunting (Damon) dredging through life as a standard no-hoper working a labouring day job and janitoring at a top university at nights. Aside from his jobs he regularly lands in trouble and generally burns through life with an attitude, to his best friend (Afleck)'s dismay. What his friend knows is that Will is brilliant, he has the mind of a prodigy.

Will could do anything or be anyone he wants but feels most at home without responsibilities, it's the duty of his friends, his girlfriend (Minnie Driver) and a burned out psychologist (played exceptionally by Robin Williams) that have to 'kick him in the ass' so to speak.

This film blew me away, and when I discovered later that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck wrote it I garnered an entire new respect for both.",
29 March 2000,Beautiful and warmhearted,"That was my first time to see Matt Damon's movie. In spite of his age,his acting was really great! I was so impressed with his acting. And also,the supporting actor,Robin Williams's acting was terrific!I definitely think this movie couldn't get such many awards without him.He is one of the greatest actors in the world.I recommend many people to see this movie.After you see this movie,you can get something warmhearted.

22 February 2020,A Classic!,"If your part of the younger audience (we'll say that you were born after this film was released) then this is an instant classic for you to watch. To watch a young Matt Damon and Robin Williams with this kind of storyline and dialogue is a absolute treat for us. I was born in 1998 and this is one of my favorite movies that was made before I was born. Highly recommend this classic movie!

16 June 2002,I really enjoyed this well-written movie.,"I thought that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon did a tremendously good job writing this movie. They both also did a good job acting in it. I also thought that Robin Williams deserved that Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor because he did an excellent job. Someone might wonder, do they really need to swear that much? But they do because Will and his friends are supposed to be living a tough life and you imagine that they would swear a lot. So because they do swear so much, that proves that Ben and Matt are very good writers and in my opinion they should write more scripts in the future, whether it's together or separate, even though they probably would do better together. So over all this movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

30 May 2022,Good film with Robin,"The guys deserve great credit for tackling a serious issue with their first screenplay and not merely filling the script with a lot of scatological humour (Though there is some of that here too, it just doesn't seem out of place) All of the characters are well rounded and sympathetic in some way, and you never feel they are there simply out of formula or to further the plot. The development of the story grows organically through the characters. Even Skylar, the love interest (played beautifully by Minnie Driver, as too are the rest of the performances great) is an interesting character in her own right and someone we want to follow through the story. The only measurable difference between her role and that of Matt Damon's is that he has more screen time, but this is understandable, given that he is the title character.

In reply to those who say that the repeated profanity use highlights a lack of writing skills, I disagree.

9 March 2003,"Smart, funny and touching but not perfect","I've watched this movie about 5 times and I have to say I really love this movie! It's about life and growing up! There are some very touching scenes with clever dialogue and GOOD acting. Robin Williams is perfect as the psychologist and Matt Damon is trustworthy, so is Ben Affleck. Minnie Diver is also acting good and you can truly say that it's something between them, the only bad thing is her laugh! But there are some flaws that makes this film not as perfect as it could have been. The fighting scene are just ridiculous and Casey Affleck is acting a little bit too ""dumb"". Cole Hauser isn't saying anything at all! Stellan Skarsg√•rd is not convincing as a professor, especially in the scene where he thinks that the answer is wrong but Will says it's right and set the paper on fire. And there is something with his accent.. Anyway, apart from some stupid scenes this is a touching film! The ending is also very good, it's just so genuine! I gave this 8 out of 10.

30 July 2004,"Good to watch, inspiring of sorts, but has loopholes","There have been many stories and cases about someone being mistreated/ abused/ abandoned as child growing up to hate the world, hate everything around him, and being disillusioned. In this movie, the protagonist, Will (Matt Damon), with that kind of past, is a mathematical genius working as a janitor at MIT. A Field's medal winning professor at MIT recognizes his talent and takes it upon himself to nurture and nourish it.

There are some serious loopholes in the movie. First, Will, though totally self educated, is shown to be genius at anything he can lay his hands on-- from history, to law, to organic chemistry, to, of course Maths. And all this while fully self educated. Its far more difficult to believe when, in the movie, he is mostly shown hanging around with his no good friends, picking up fist fights, drinking, getting in crimes, etc. I can understand amazing talent, yes, but even for that talent to show off as well it did in his case, the mind needs to be free from all this distractions. I can't help wondering how, he, in spite of all this disturbing things currently going on his life, he manages to do that. This is rather unreal to me.

Historically, the geniuses talked about in the movie and compared to Will (Einstein, Ramanujan) both didn't come from broken or abandoned families. Yes, both were geniuses who started of doing something else and were recognized late as geniuses, yes -- but that was because of social or educational systems in which they grew up that didn't recognize or encourage their merit. They could put their minds fully in the scientific or mathematical problems they were working on.

There are more clich√©s -- like the bar scene. I have something similar at ""Harvard"" bars, yes, but what is shown in the movie is rather exaggerated. Then, when referring to Ramanujan, the Maths Prof signs of the dot on forehead to indicate Indian -- thats a silly and stupid! MIT (and boston area, that has the BHCC too) has always had a lot of Indian maths profs and students, and while that action might have been understandable in the middle of cowboy country where no one may have seen an Indian for real, its difficult to imagine someone who works with so many Indians to give such a stereotypical description.

Then, the Maths prof himself, and his apparent inability to understand the effect of Will's past. Most MIT profs I know are more sensible than that. The relations between the faculty and the folks grounds dept (where the latter is seen swearing at the prof after he leaves) is much better here, and there is much much less swearing than is seen in the movie!

Wonder what the Bunker Hill CC folks thought of the movie, since in a way, it pits MIT against BHCC.

Still, its a good watch, and personally -- I can relate to somethings in the movie!",
19 February 2005,there are not enough words to describe how great this film is,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are an unbeatable writing team and have created a marvelous film here. It makes you think about your life and how you do the same thing everyday and hope one day that best friend of yours is not gonna answer the door because they finally decided to do something instead of staying in the same spot all your life. I personally am going through that right now. I picked up and moved on a whim January of last year. Thats why i can truly relate to matt damons character and to add to this brilliant movie formula you have robin williams. If you have not seen this movie or are anything like me you will definitely want to pick this up because after one time you will end up watching it over and over and over again as i do. This is definitely a good will movie worth hunting for.

22 May 2006,"Daemon is a genius, Williams is the man who tries to tell him that","Unless you wanna talk about you, who you are! Then I'm fascinated... I'm in! But you don't wanna do that do you? You are terrified what you might see...

Daemon is a genius, Williams is the man who tries to tell him that. We see a boy become a man, twice actually. The film is about friendship, love, passion, following your dreams. It is soft yes, it is American indeed, but no film have ever done it like that to me. This film is real, the acting is marvelous, I believe in it, I want to believe that Will is alive, that Sean is a shrink, and that Skylar is devastated in love with this weird man/boy who does not know who he is.

I love this film, nothing more to say :-)

29 August 2004,And it gave us Ben and Matt to boot,"I have seen this film 3 times, and find myself liking it more with each viewing. There is a lot going on throughout the story. It is a lot about growing up--a lot about finding the courage to better yourself, and accept who you are without listening to friends you love, but may be better without for a while. The Oscars that year must have been interesting---(is there any tape available for previous Oscar telecasts?). These two unknown children dominating the awards. It's just become a classic movie now.

I like the story and the message it gives. I'm not too familiar with film school teachings, but obviously, these two must've done something right. Perhaps, the film school should examine their curriculm, eh?

31 December 2004,Very Good Will,"The film that broke both Damon and Affleck in the big league was definitely one of my favourite films of the 90's.

I would return to this film to watch Robin Williams character alone, he is simply outstanding as the shrink trying to get in to Will's (Damon) head, in particular he delivers a speech to Will sitting on a park bench that enchanted and amazed me.

I like the idea of clever guys being made into hero's in films for a change rather than the burly action figures we see in the same types of movie year in year out.

It is interesting looking back to see the different directions that Affleck and Damon's careers have gone, maybe neither of them will ever beat this moment.

29 July 2023,The Best Movie,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",10

10 August 2002,the supporting cast... CHEMISTRY,"what makes a good movie? is it the headline actors: the big stars? or is it the actors you've never seen before? the actors that you'd like to see more of. that is what Good Will Hunting is chock full of. a bunch of reletively unknown actors. Casey Affleck- to this day he is known and referred to as Ben Affleck's brother. or to my friends he is ""the brother on the phone you know the one with the book in American Pie""... in Good Will Hunting, however i see his talent. he is so funny in this movie (not to mention HOTT... lol) as you watch the movie you can see the chemistry he shares with the other guys with Matt and Ben (watch the ""double burger"" scene for their sibling quarrels...) and Cole Hauser- he is not in the movie as much, just sitting there being quiet buying the beer. but he says one of the funniest lines in the movie (You're legally allowed to drink so we thought the best thing for you was a car)

i didn't watch this movie because of hype. i didn't purchase it because Matt Damon is completely HOTT (and for the record i do think that...) i love this movie because it is all about human interaction. without chemistry, it would've been the worst movie ever. but there was a chemistry there that you can feel.

if you have yet to watch this movie, i encourage you to rent it at Blockbuster or borrow it from a friend. GWH is worth your $2.99 and 2 1/2 hours. there are no sinking boats or asteroids. and nobody gets killed. this is just raw emotion, a few friends, the f- word 96 times and some beer. you don't have to agree with me, i am not a professional and (in case you want to know) i am a teeny-bopper and legally cannot even watch this movie. but see for yourself the movie that made me cry before i saw it. and the best performance you will ever be able to see by an ensamble cast of reletively unknown actors and Robin Williams. thank you all. have a great day!

25 November 2014,Amazing!,"This movie actually surprised me. I was expecting a boring movie about math. But then i watched it and I have watched it at least 70 times since then, maybe more. Anyways if you haven't watched this movie then i recommend it to anyone who loves moving movies. 10 out of 10 easy. I personally love Matt Damon as an actor and he truly gives one of the best performances of his career. And if u love movies then I would like to recommend another movie, A Beautiful Mind. It stars Russel Crowe and he is absolutely amazing in the movie. All in all, Good Will Hunting is definitely a must see movie and is one of my favorites of all time. Thanks for reading. Hope u enjoy the movie of u watch it....

14 September 2010,Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a gift in mathematics,"Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a gift in mathematics; however, he has had struggles growing up as an orphan. He struggles to find a purpose in his life. Hanging around with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Morgan O'Malley (Casey Affleck), and Billy McBride (Cole Hauser) and going to clubs after work are the norm for Will and his pals. Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsguard) works at the local university where Will is employed as a custodian. Professor Lambeau gets a sense of Will's gift when a question he has posted on a board outside of his classroom mysteriously becomes solved by someone outside of his class. Will, is in fact the one that has been providing the solutions. After a run-in with the law, Professor Lambeau, wants to give Will a chance to use his skills. Professor Lambeau, being a mathematician himself, takes on the responsibility of Will and posts bail for him. The only conditions for Will are to assist Professor Lambeau in the math area and Will must meet with a psychiatrist on a weekly basis. The psychiatrist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), takes on the task of counseling Will when no other counselors could seem to accomplish the task.

Will meets with Sean Maguire and demonstrates his intelligence by testing the doctor of his thinking. Matt Damon displays excellent acting skills, along with Robin Williams when they meet in their sessions. Their sessions evolve into a great friendship of trust and love. Will was abused by his foster father and relates to Dr. Maguire as he was also abused by his father.

Professor Lambeau's main goal with Will is to find him employment where he may use his amazing mathematic skills. He wants Will to have what he could not have because his mathematic skills are not so amazing. Will makes fun of the Professor's attempts throughout the movie in setting up various employment opportunities. The Professor and Dr. Maguire have words because Dr. Maguire feels that Professor Lambeau is trying to decide Will's life for him.

Will also meets a girl, Skylar (Minnie Driver), who he falls in love with, but given his past he has a hard time remaining in the relationship because he is afraid to be committed to someone.

This movie is very well written and directed. It has humor, love, and friendship all combined into one. The music is fitting and the scene angles vary from subjective to objective. There is closeness exhibited in the scene where Dr. Maguire and Will meet for the first time. The scene is very intense. There is also use of a high-angle shot during the intimate scene with Will and his girlfriend, Skylar. A viewer must watch the film to see if Will finds his purpose in life‚Äîwill he go after the girl? Will he pursue the employment that Professor Lambaugh sets up for him? Or will he continue his everyday usual events of hanging out with his pals?",9
1 July 2020,Simply. Genius.,"They sure don't make movies like this anymore. Not that they ever could. We'll never replace Robin. We'll never have 20's Damon back. This movie made careers. Even to some extent, Robin's career was greatly impacted by this movie - by the depth of character in which it is explored.

30 May 2016,Good Will Hunting,"When you watch Good Will Hunting, you have to look past the Oscars and other awards it's gotten. Because beneath all that, it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful script written by two talented young men and acted out by equally talented actors such as Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.

One of the most enjoyable parts of the movie was the psychological aspect. We have a typical 21 year old, going out and drinking with his friends, getting in fights etc., but underneath all that there's so much more to him. This movie tells us that we shouldn't look at the surface alone, there is so much more to people.

The acting in this movie was incredible, Matt Damon played the role of Will Hunting without fault, he displayed the emotions, the cockiness, he displayed how Will was closed off due to his childhood trauma and he displayed how Will shrouded his weakness with smart talk and intellect. Robin Williams played the therapist Sean Maguire, a man who has seen life unlike the life his fellow academics have, on the battlefield in Vietnam. He recently lost his wife, who he regarded as his soulmate and best friend.

Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his out of this world genius. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben Affleck. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship. Yes there is a girl in the movie, but there isn't much focus on that aspect.

The fact that most of the people keep on talking about the probability of someone being as smart as Will tells us that this is a story, that this isn't real. Even so it relates to almost everyone who has been at Will's age. They have dealt with insecurities, fear of not being accepted, etc.

Overall, I think it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful message and amazing effort from everyone in the cast and crew. Especially from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who co-wrote the script for this movie. It is definitely a must watch.",9
18 November 2006,Good Will Hunting is a Myth with mythical beliefs about intelligence!,"While this is actually a good movie, the fallacies that it promotes outweigh it entertainment value. People are not born to greatness. Greatness comes from hard work, studying and practice. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to con you out of something. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't have what it takes! Marva Collins sent average, problem, and by some measures hopeless students to the best schools! Demand good teachers! Forget this Hollywood propaganda! You can be great! Matt Damon and his prettyboy friends need you to swallow this hocum. Get to work! Study! Practice! You can be all that you dream!

7 September 1998,new standards in dialogues,"GWH, is one of the films of the 90's, thats responsible for what you could call 'new dialogue movies', I think. the movie is one of the best I've seen in that 'new' genre. Dialogue is real, natural and powerful. The other great thing about the movie is the camerawork, nice, clean, nothing fancy, the way every movie should be, but only so few movies can afford to be. Its the first movie I rated 10, not because its perfect, but mainly because its as close to perfect as any movie will get.

22 September 2011,Good Will Hunting,"At first glance, Good Will Hunting in its title alone does not lure anyone into grabbing this DVD off the Blockbuster shelf. But once rented, the pleasure was all mine. Filled with the humor of Ben Affleck, intensity of Robin Williams and mystery of Matt Damon the nine out of ten stars basically rolls right off my tongue. Picture the drama of a tear filled chick-flick combined with the raw brash fight scenes of a Bruce Willis action thriller all while kicking back with microwave popcorn and can of coke¬Öpriceless, minus the popcorn and coke! This movie is Affleck and Damon's break out moment. The movie, set in the gritty streets of South Boston, finds its irony in Matt Damon's character, Will Hunting, an unusual 21 year- old math prodigy holding a job as a janitor at the prestigious MIT. Although a bit far-fetched, the cast is perfection in leaving one to wonder why no one dreams to be a janitor. Why can't that be fulfilling enough?

Moving on to junior mints, everyone will relate to the simple story line. Ben Affleck's chain smoking, beer drinking character Chuckie, tries to persuade Will toward a better life. Of course, don't we all have a friend like that? Will has a way off the streets that have hurt him, but loyalty is hard to leave. When Will's abusive past continues to haunt his future, enters Sean (Robin Williams) as his new therapist. From here on in the battle is waged whether Will's life of work and bar brawls with friends is the happy ending of his story. Ah, a breath of fresh air and a far cry from our open era of self-induced reality stardom and athletic phenoms, finding success only in the money they spend. It brings to life what makes any of us tick. What keeps us from staying safely where we are and what pushes us to dream?

Renting now is a no brainer since these names today would fill theater seats on star power alone¬Ödo take into account no one had heard of Affleck or Damon when it hit the big screen. Robin Williams surprises straying from his in your face stand-up comedy to play a therapist who maybe hasn't quite reached his potential. And expect him to have to take a long hard look at his own life. Insert dramatic music and play in slow motion-not that sappy.

My infatuation with the movie stops short as I take one star from my count due to the made for Hollywood ending. The film is inspirational, witty and smart¬Öuntil the ending. I understand that the grand finale sells tickets and the audience appreciates certain outcomes but no need to dumb down what is central to the story as reality begs for loose ends or bad choices or death or something. No one's life is neat and tidy and Will Hunting along with the rest of the cast could conceivably be in rehab for a very long time. I was not ready to say The End and think happily ever after.

Good Will Hunting¬Ösurprisingly not about hunting at all. I hesitate to push people to see a film held in such high regards, but it carries itself with a simple charm that allows a deep story to be told. The acting is top notch with the characters believable. Fix the ending and we can run down the beach with Bo Derek in the pursuit of that perfect 10!",
29 December 2000,Williams and Damon are perfect,"Fabulous movie. Williams plays the role perfect. Damon is the perfect actor for his role, and matches Williams perfect. Nice to see a good movie, with all that is needed. A must see movie, which I sure am going to watch many times.

10 September 1998,Good but not great.,"I came into Good Will Hunting expecting a great movie. What I saw wasn't great, however it was still pretty good. I give the movie a 7.5/10, mainly due to some of the smart dialogue, and the strong performance from Robin Williams. Other than that the rest of the actors weren't that special. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver are not especially convincing, and I did not see much chemistry between the two. I hope Matt Damon's performance in Rounders is better. I think he was the only bad thing in Saving Private Ryan. Overall none of the actors are bad and the story is interesting, so you should definitely check out this movie if you haven't already.

19 September 1998,Good script and actors,"I really love this movie. The script was wonderfully written. It combines with lots of literary elements, such as a person's quest of self, pair contrast, etc. The genius, the math professor and the shrink establish a well-constructed triangular attachment and conflict. And the three actors, especially Robin Williams, are all excellent indeed. But near the end, this gifted kid seems to change himself too fast. A bit inconvincible But still it's a touching movie, dealing with value judgment, friendship, and ""carpe diem"". For those who haven't seen this, go see it!

9 March 1999,"Great script, acting, but diminished by ""Hollywood Style""","GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good movie. The writing, credited to Mssrs. Afleck and Damon, is among the best I can remember in a recent American film. Mr Afleck appears to have benefited from the script of CHASING AMY or vice-versa. Robin Williams' role as the burned out shrink ties everything together to make this a memorable story. I wish he would do more of this type of material and less clowning.

However, the credible story, realistic characters, and excellent script beautifully played by the cast are restrained by a glossy presentation. Anyone familiar with the coastal Northeast (story takes place in Boston) knows overcast skies, wind, rain. The relentless sunshine bathes the story in a California like light but with gritty old Boston as the backdrop. Doesn't work.

Nitpicking? Probably, but this film is very close to being as good as movies get and every little misstep becomes magnified as a result.

Also the actors pretty much seem like they are on their natural state and that makes you just dive in and want to connect with them. Easy to watch and hard to forget because you will never find and other movie like it,

27 September 1998,Life changing!,"Some people (like Anonymous from Vancouver, Canada) may say it's not that good, but you can only say it if you're under anonymity, really. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did an amazing job with the script. It's catching, it's bright and it's got a life of its own. The character ""Will Hunting"" is sooo complex! If you watch the movie 100 times you'll find 100 people who could relate to this guy. It's unbelievable! The first person will probably be yourself (it happened to me), but later you'll find your best friend, your worst enemy, your mother. Don't take my word for it! Watch it 100 times and see for yourself! It's worth it.

16 February 1999,"Great Characterization, needs a little more.....","Perhaps many people have placed too much emphasis on this movie. I am not saying this in a derogatory way. The characterization in this movie is brilliant. Matt Damon and Robin Williams give outstanding performances, although they do become a little predictable by the time that the movie is over. Perhaps this movie is just that: a characterization. The plot allows us to look at a man that is intelligent; far more intelligent than the average MIT student (as supposedly proved in the theorem-solving part of the movie). Like an action movie star, the main character allows us to look at someone that is unlike us. This goes for the character that Williams plays. We look at a psychologist with a type of awe: perhaps they see an insight into the human psyche that no one can (supposedly). The problem is that: the movie is full of characterization. Even though there are a few people that Damon plays running around the streets, we look into his life, and are forced to like him. Going out on a limb, I am saying that this movie is like a Steinbeck book: the characterization is superb, but the other elements are lacking. Don't let this movie escape you though, it is worth seeing the characterization alone. By the time the movie is over, you will feel that you know the people intimately. That is the reason that I give this movie a 6.8 out of 10",
25 December 1998,excellent movie,"Good Will Hunting is exactly what I've been waiting for. A nice intelligent movie that is dramatic yet funny. I think that this movie shows the wonderful talent of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck not only as actors but as writers. I'm sure it will be a favorite movie for years to come. I would even go as far as to say that one day, many years from now, it will be considered a great classic.

30 December 1998,Enjoy the good lines.,"Good Will Hunting really should have been a play. This is not to say that it wasn¬¥t a good movie, because it still does move very well and the cinematography was excellent. However, the real joy of the movie is not so much in the visual effects, as in, for example, Saving Private Ryan, but in the dialogue.

16 January 2019,Wicked good movie for all to enjoy,"Good Will Hunting is a timeless classic, that won countless awards, including an Oscar, a Golden Globe and multiple nominees. This movie relays on the acting and bad boy personality of Matt Damon. Throughout the movie the audience follows the life and what his actions do to others. While this movie was released in the 90's, I still enjoyed and understood the film. The themes and underlying messages also still transfer over to today's day and age. I was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. The film captured my attention as I felt many different real emotions, because of the angles/shots, soundtrack and script. In the opening scene you get a look at how rickety Will's (Matt Damon) life is in the south side of Boston. Along with this you get aerial views and pan shots of Boston to set the scene. I enjoyed the setting because it showed the rich high life society of Cambridge but also the desolate housing and college pubs. With having it set at MIT is a bit of a cliche, in the sense that of course Will should belong at MIT because of his intelligence. A positive to being set at MIT is that the writers were able to compare Will to the smartest students and professors in the nation. One of my favorite scenes was the one in which Will met Skylar (Minnie Driver). Will showed off his wicked smarts, and by the end of the night he got her phone number. Matt Damon has a comedic line about apples. By adding this joke I believe it helps to captivate the audience before the movie shifts to being more serious. Skylar's has some personality quirks. She always seems give the excuse that she needs to study and work hard, on the other hand Matt Damon has the natural talent to read something and memorize it. She believes in Matt and wants him to succeed in life and have a chance. Everyone but Will believes in his potential. With his rough childhood background he has never been rewarded of his accomplishments. Will has many struggles in his life and doesn't know how to balance his math intelligence with his social life. As a result Will seems to get in trouble continuously but has become a manipulating and is able to get him out of many situations. But on the judges last straw he sends Will to jail, and the only reason he got out was because of the MIT professor. One of the conditions that Will has to agree to though is to go to therapy. After the Professor sends Will to therapy will opens up about his past and his trust issues. One important theme that I took away from Good Will Hunting was that child abuse and a rough childhood can lead to trust issues. Much like Will's childhood with abuse and multiple homes, Matilda (Mara Wilson) grew up with child abuse and until she was finally able to trust her teacher and create a lasting bond. Another aspect that connects both movies is that both Will and Matilda are brilliant as a result of reading hundreds of books. It's easy to relate to how heartbroken Robin Williams is with his wife dying. I feel that by put his time into therapy he is able to escape his grief. I really enjoyed his eccentric storytelling of the day he met his wife. This scene added to how Robin Williams was able to balance his grief with remembering the joyous memories. The shots and angles in this film were also well put together. During most of Will's therapy sessions the director uses eye level and medium shots. By using this effect the director is able to have the audience feel like they are in the room. Along with this the readers are forced to read the facial expressions to get a sense of emotion. During every therapy session but the last both Sean and Will are not in the same shot together. By creating this composition it creates the effect of a real conversation that goes back and forth. Another example of how the director used angles/shots was when he strategically used a high angle shot to show power and dominance. This scene occurred while Will burned the proofs and Professor (Stellan Skarsgard) was on his knees and the camera angle was above him. Will's power over his own life shows true here because of the element of a high shot. The fight scene is a notable scene because of the sounds and music in the background. The music is very subtle, and there is multiple layers of other peoples voices, but overall the directors were able to edit it together to make it feel like the audience was in the right scene. and finally there is a cop car that skids to a start and arrests Matt Damon. The soundtrack for the remainder of the film is very well thought and adds to either the suspense, happiness of craziness going on in Matt Damon's life. The script includes dialect that is noticeably a Boston accent. There was the use of wicked which is a famous Boston stereotype. The accents were also very strong on Matt Damon and his Southie friends like Ben Affleck. I think it was a wise decision to cast Matt Damon and Ben Affleck because of their natural Boston accents. The ending to me was a bit predictable, in scenes earlier you were foreshadowed by what was ahead. Also in most movies there is a happy ending and this movie does just that. The director also left with a bit of a cliffhanger which in today's movies is expected to have the audience create their own ending. By the end of the movie I felt attached to Will's character and Sean's grief, and the romance between Skylar and Will. Good Will Hunting was a classic movie that will be enjoyed by many in the coming years. I would definitely recommend putting in the time to watch and enjoy Good Will Hunting.",8
26 January 1999,"A wonderful, moving experience.","Starting slow but interesting, I found the story utterly absorbing and emotionally moving (which is, unfortunately, quite rare with me). For me it was one of those movies that you check your watch and pray it's not over yet -- it's not a story you watch to bring you from Point A to Point B -- it's the going that's good. It's a well-written, well-acted story with deep characters that you care about.

Even the least-developed main relationship, Will and Skylar's, was profound. The torment that Will brought her in the end merely reflects his own, and you can feel that.

I'd love to see a sequal (Better Will Hunting?) to see what they do with Will/Skylar. If it were true to life, it'd have her telling him to shove-off, but that'd make for a pretty short movie.

26 February 1999,Mediocre first effort,"So I hear everyone talking about this great movie by two young up and coming actors looking for work and how awesome this movie is. And so, I go and I see Good Will Hunting. Now I know why Matt Damon was struggling to find work. I bought the screenplay and read it before I ever saw the movie and the screenplay itself is great. I've read it many times since and each time, I still love it. However, for some reason, the executives at Miramax failed to see that letting Damon and also Minnie Driver have roles in this movie would be a mistake. Affleck is a good actor, although his part sucks in this movie but Damon went and wrote a whole story about his character and then failed to deliver. There were a few positives. The friendship between Affleck and Damon does spill over into the movie and it does leave an impression. Robin Williams is great. I mean, the man can do anything. Comedy, drama, anything. But the rest of the cast is pretty much mediocre except for Ben Affleck who also was good in Chasing Amy. In all, this movie was OK but nowhere near as good as the hype made it out to be. The screenplay is definitely worth buying but the acting in the movie itself pretty much sucks.

7 March 1999,So Boring!!!!!!,"After hearing people rant and rave about how terrific this movie was....some even saying when it came out in home video they were going to BUY a copy, not just rent it, I figured it had to be a terrific movie. Boy, was I ever led down the garden path. The only GOOD thing about it was familiar scenery in Boston. The premise of a lowly janitor solving complex mathematical problems was a good one. But once the viewer found that out, then what? Nothing happens at all....just a bunch of video filling, time wasting pablum puke. The plot completely fell apart so that you are left with, ""Okay, so the janitor is a genius, now what? What does he do with this capability? Anything? No....NOTHING!!!"" I want my $6.75 back PLUS damages!!! What a total waste of two hours!!!

5 June 1999,Thought out script,"A streamlined, honest work of screenwriting art that Syd Field certainly approves of. Without Van Sant's unflinching commitment, this film likely would not have even been made. Screenwriters should buy this script and study it's structure. There isn't a line uttered throughout the entire film that we've heard before, except ""I love you""(and if you are going to have a line we've heard in other films, that my friends, is the one you want it to be).

19 February 2000,I don't understand the complaints,"I don't usually comment on movies, but I felt compelled to respond to some of these poor reviews. The justifications for giving Good Will Hunting a low mark seem (in general) barely thought out and petty. Someone's assertion that Affleck and Damon simply couldn't think of what to say so they kept using the ""f word"" stands out. Go to this web site's Good Will Hunting memorable quote page. There is a reason why it is one of the longest of any movie featured.

Arguments that the individual story lines are unrelated and the ending is weak, lead me to believe you must have been trying to put moves on your date instead of watching the movie. Instead, of giving us a hokey feel good ending, Affleck and Damon offer something much more insightful and honest. Will recognizes that he must deal with lingering emotional problems before he can be satisfied and successful in any profession. The ending is only a recognition of the problem, not a solution. So instead of neatly wrapped up closure, Good Will Hunting ends with something much closer to real life.",9
11 May 2001,Interesting but not accurate,"A very interesting movie. I enjoyed it. The plot was very predictable. The mathematical proofs looked kind of sketchy. And the depiction of MIT was just plain wrong.

31 May 2020,Exploring the mind of a traumatic genius,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",8
27 February 2020,Excellent Movie,"It's an excellent story with a great cast. Two very important messages for me. Firstly, Educational opportunities for people of all backgrounds and walks of life so People can live up to their potential and have opportunity to excel in their strengths. Secondly the importance of people getting support for past traumas that have impacted their life so they can cope and go on and live productive lives.

20 June 2013,wish i saw this in theatres!,"I love this movie beyond belief. I wish i could have seen this when it came out. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon did an excellent job at writing it and starring in it. A masterpiece. Tale of a prodigy math genius plagued by his past and his inability to connect to anyone close. The conflict with Matt Damon's character really keeps you engaged. I truly had feelings of hope, joy, and sadness. This movie is one of the ones you simply have to watch at least once. I give it a high review because it should maintain its superiority in today's dilute and mediocre film industry. Shining example of what true cinema can bring. Thank you Ben and Matt, Truly touched me in this tale.

Ps. excellent movie for a date night ;)

16 June 2001,"Beautiful, just beautiful","Congratulations to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for this one. The story is just fantastic. The boy-genius who just wanted to be normal and didn¬¥t want to get the opportunities because he was too afraid of the changes in his life and that he would lose control of the process. Actually, this film isn¬¥t just about the charismatic character Will Hunting, it`s really about us. Maybe neither the director nor the writers wanted to tell this, but that`s just about it. In this lonely world we are afraid to open ourselves to the people around us because we fear they might hurt us. We want to be in control of our own world. Ok, this shields away most suffering, but it also blocks a great heap of happiness . Will has a hard time discovering his true potential and what his life can become. But, than again, so do we. Some people I met hated the film because he rejected great job opportunities and went after happiness. I think these people are afraid to pursue their dreams too. Never give up your dreams

29 March 2007,Still on top of my list,"I cant stop to wonder why it is that so many people like to relate a movie (meaning = entertainment) to real life. people, that is not what movies are for, those things are called Documentaries and the 8 o clock news. Movies are for entertainment, and so is Good Will hunting.

It is meant to make you feel something, and fortunately for us, everybody feels different after seeing this movie, great! but to go as far as saying: its putting janitors in a bad daylight, and they didn't wrote the script, its not historically correct, etc, etc, and then giving this movie a 1 score, is saying more about you then this movie in itself.

If you did not like this movie, because you have a different taste, or just did not liked the story, great, please do rate this movie low(er), but you cannot hide the feeling you got from this movie, be it goosebumps, anger, sleep or whatever. that is at least something. I have seen a lot of movies where I did not felt anything afterwards, now that means the movie was bad! Skylar and Will play great together. I can totally feel the fun the had in the beginning of their relationship. The tight friendship with his friends is totally heartwarming, and Robbin Williams really felt like a good, soft man to me.

I smiled, swallowed, cried, laughed and busted my gut on this movie. sure, the story could be better, but the feeling i got from it not.

I know the jokes inside out in this movie, and still, when I watch this movie, I laugh.. that alone is worth a 10 to me.",10
1 August 2001,one of my favorites,"Movies do not need special effects to captivate audiences. What good movies should need (like Good Will Hunting) is some astonishing dialouge and lines to keep people laughing and possibly even crying.

""Good Will Hunting"" is a movie that makes you think. The characters are so real, that the movie does nothing but captivate the audience by the authenticity of the actors. Both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (who also co-wrote the movie) share this unique bond that audience members admire.

For those who havent seen this, I completely recommend it! It is a great film with spectacular dialogue, superb acting and above all- a geniune story guaranteed to touch the heart!

3 December 2006,"A movie about a troubled young man, his past, and his future.","This film follows the life of Will Hunting, a diamond-in-the rough genius who makes a living out of the small town Southie by working as a janitor at the prestigious MIT. After anonymously completing an equation that eventually underlines his genius, he is found out by the renown Fields medal winner Professor Lambeau. With his help, along with a psychiatrist named Sean Maguire, he learns to accept his past and move forward with his childhood problems, despite his greatest fears, witty quips, girl problems, and bad habits, that are all the more amplified by his genius and lack of willingness to take advantage of opportunities.

9 October 2021,A Review: Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Sant,"1997s Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Saint is an American drama story that follows a troubled unrecognized genius Will Hunting (Matt Damon) who works as a janitor at MIT. Will is ready to spend his days working a minimal wage job and drinking with his buddies on the weekend until he solves a complex math problem and gets the attention of Prof. Gerald Lambeau who decides to help Will achieve his full potential by solving math problems and getting his life back on track with the help of Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Dr. Maguire acts as a therapist to Will, delving into his deepest fears and worries whilst confronting his own underlying issues in the process.

Review

At first glance, Good Will Hunting seems like a very generic drama with a quite predictable plot, and it is, there is the unrealistically smart genius to whom we could never relate, who despite being so gifted, needs someone else to help him reach his potential. But what really sets this movie apart, is not the plot or crazy unpredictable characters, but the truly realistic and hard-hitting emotions this movie is able to recreate in the viewer's mind. All the characters undergo their own development arch instead of funneling all their screentime into developing only the protagonist, which makes the movie feel way less constricted. You can see the effect of one person directly and significantly impacting another, just like it would in the real world, and most of the time you can really relate and feel those emotions. But the moments where this movie truly shines are the therapy sessions between Will Hunting and Dr. Sean Maguire. They delve deep into the human psyche and emotions, not being afraid of confronting themselves and the viewer with some harsh truths. You can feel the connection they make during the runtime of the film, and Sean becomes almost a guiding father figure to Will. Of course, the character interactions are not the only strong suit of the film. The acting was truly superb, making you believe everything the characters are saying without a doubt. The synergy between Matt Damon and Robin Williams was immaculate.

Conclusion and final thoughts

Overall Good Will Hunting is one incredible movie, achieving such emotional realism that is hard to find these days with all the mainstream blockbusters. It is not afraid to present the rather cruel reality of life, while still showing how to create truly meaningful connections and make you relate to almost all the characters in some way or another. I think this movie is a must-watch for any teenager/young adult.",9
18 March 2022,Great,"Great Screenplay by Matt Damon And Ben Affleck. Absolutely Loved it. Great Acting From All Th e Cast Members Especially From Robin Williams, Loved His Performance.

4 July 2002,Matt & Ben should write more scripts!,"I think it is safe to say that anyone who has seen this movie will wonder how two young actors managed to write such a beautiful and realistic story, with characters you can relate to despite the fact that one of them is an overlooked math genius. Add to that creditable performances from everyone involved (esp. Robin Williams in semi-dramatic mode), good directing and wonderful musical contribution from Elliott Smith (who was unfortunate not to win a Grammy for ""Miss Misery""), and you have one of the most endearing movies ever. You can tell right away from the first scene that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are the bestest of friends, and they have several poignant scenes in this movie. Minnie Driver was good as well, and you have to feel for her character. Well, like I said before...those two really should write more scripts, who knows what other stories are stored away in their heads. Watch this movie if you haven't already!

24 October 2022,I like them apples,"I watched this movie three times and increased my score on it every time, this movie is a classic and timeless. This movie will get better with time. The pacing and the dialect is what makes this movie. It keeps things simple from the storyline of a very complex characters. This will always be in my top 20(I watch Lott of movies) and I always find myself thinking of the dialect such as wills conversations at the bar. I feel that every one will enjoy this movie especially if you know nothing about it. It will keep your attention and the movie will not go a minute too long, I don't like romance movies and this movie accepted that fact for ppl like me.

30 September 2002,Never get tired of a good story,"I never saw this movie in the cinema. I regret this. Many months later, after the hype subsided, I decided to rent the movie on video. What I watched was a thoroughly entertaining story!

It's this kind of story that is simple enough to get enticed straight away and real enough that you don't lose interset half way through.

The real hook for Good Will Hunting, though, is Robin Williams performance. He was good in 'Awakenings' and even better in 'Dead Poets Society', but never better than here as the burnt out councillor who hasn't been challenged in years. He finally meets his match in Will Hunting (Matt Damon).

There are many sub-plots in this story, but the ones that will make you sit up and take notice will be the exchanges between Will Hunting and Sean (Robin Williams).

There are also many fine supporting performances, some of which have never been bettered in other movies. Stellan Skarsgard is convincing as the pretentious, insecure MIT professor. Ben Affleck also delivers his best performance to date as the ever loyal, Chuckie. Perhaps the only let down performance is by Minnie Driver.

Overall, It's the kind of movie you can sit and watch time and time again and never get tired of.

I rate it 10 out of 10.",10
17 November 2002,A great Film,"This is one of the best films I've seen to date. I've watched it three times in a row and if I ever picked it off the shelf I'd watch it three times again. Very good with the best speeches ever, The cast is great, very funny -dont listen to stupid people's opions on it, they have no freedom of speach in my view. See it now!

17 March 2009,"""It's not your fault.""","Matt Damon says, to the Oscar reviews on this movie , that ""the voters aren't always right"", and he's so correct.

This is so far the most soul-clutching movie I've ever seen. It's as simple as that.

For people who never understand how emotionally bruised teens end up in various symptoms of depression, go watch this movie. WATCH CLOSELY.

Watch and see for yourself, how pain builds over pain, and eventually bricks up a thick, cold, ugly wall that resists sunlight to come in. How he who with such a wall established inside ""pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him"", and that however much he may in a corner of his heart longs for genuine warmth or intimacy, he's just not able to open up and let them in. And, most importantly, watch for when the WALL is being melted down, how much emotion can explode from and flood out of that person and break you, the watcher, down into wild tears, if you are able to comprehend the amount of pain behind it.

Matt Damon did it, with incredible accuracy. Point is when you approach such subject with emotionally bruised characters,even the slightest hint of inauthenticity could easily give you away----for the people who did experience it know exactly how it is. And any mishandling of such emotion, too far-pushed or too slow, will inevitably cause the audiences to resent----for they felt like being misexplored at their most painful spot.

But he did so well. He causes you to resonate with your own bruises, face up to your own pain. No patronizing, no preaching, no trivializing. Every scar was revealed in an authentic, respectful, humane and serious kind of way that you end up in gratitude that the creator of this film truly cares----it's not just about a movie, it's about psychological wounds many share in common. It's about human, and humanity.

I wonder how Matt Damon did it so well. I'd rather assume that he did, for himself once had a similar experience in life, than that he simply achieved this by outstanding acting skills. The latter would be nearly impossible to do, having known for myself what this type of pain was really like.

Affleck and Damon are an unbelievable team, both in acting and writing this movie. Robin Williams sure as hell deserves the Oscar he got for his role here, and the rest of the cast all did a great job. The movie has a very smooth and well-structured storyline. No waste scenes, one step tightly after another, unfolding the character's emotion progresses. When you finally witness Williams's role gets to the soul of Damon's role with a number of ""It's not your fault"", your icy wall if you have one too, shattered with it.

Most soulful movie I've ever seen. For me it's mostly because I suffered similar bruises myself, but note this, you do not need such thing to appreciate it. All you need to be, is a true human being.

Go see Good Will Hunting.",
29 September 2003,Entertaining,"I re-watched this movie the other night. I saw it when it came out and thought it was so-so. A bit predictable really, as people here have pointed out. But I also found it to be entertaining. I like Gus Van Zants films but I was surprised to learn that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this script. Good job!

28 September 2014,"It's an old movie, but it still got important things to tell","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",6
27 November 2005,"Simply put, a masterpiece.","This film easily ranks as one of my all time favorites. The script is brilliant, the performances are genuine and powerful. Actually, powerful is the best word to describe this film. After the first viewing, I felt an overwhelming aftertaste of euphoria. There are so many valuable life lessons you can glean from this tale of a ""super smart"" yet troubled young man (Matt Damon)who finds the complicated simple yet the fundamental aspects of social human interaction very difficult. Given the fact that Matt Damon also co-wrote the screenplay (while in his early 20's) with real life pal and co-star Ben Affleck is even more impressive. I consistently find myself shocked to hear that some have not yet experienced this gem. If you love movies, you must see this movie. I can't seem to stop singing it's praises even as it approaches the films ten year mark.

In short, if you haven't already seen this film, find some quiet time, rent it and savor one of the highlights of cinematic history.

20 January 2011,Transformational,"Fantastic acting, writing, and directing. Robin Williams transitions from his comedy normality to the engaging, layered, and connected realm of drama. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have scripted a mater piece with Damon delivering a performance that, like wine, ages into perfection, and Affleck secures a remarkable performance.

I have watched this film more than 300 times and relate to the character of Will (his contextualization of capability on mathematical terminology within the distinct realm of infinite discovery and capacity and yet his loss of identity due to various personal life experiences and the broader scope of identity in the environmental dichotomy of characters and influences. WIll Hunting is one of the most brilliant characters in cinematic history. Despite his unique disposition, he is human and we can relate to him, as the audience. We root for him to win. We root for him to find himself.

11 January 2015,A sensational movie !,"What can I say about this movie.. It is simple sensational. For a good understanding about the essence of this movie, it needs to be analyzed with an open heart, it is need to be done in a sentimental way not in a robotic one.

The importance of the message within this movie, we can find in our life, the need of someone near us represent's not just a simple need of affiliation to a certain group but a need for a protective ""shield"" that has the meant to protect us from all of our problems and to push us from the heavy part of our life. This movie has managed to perfectly expose the feelings that one person, in this case Will Hunting, has gained from the negative part that has marked his life. We can observe the fact that,life,even if we believe that in the first moments it has to be gentile, to show us the most beautiful thing,love,but life can be harsh with some of us even from the beginning of it and it throws us in a totally different world characterized by ignorance,poverty,fear,violence,etc. The affirmation of Will has another important role in the key of perception and the message is very clear- Just with the opening of our souls,with true friendship and love we can outrun the most difficult obstacles that has been attributed to us. The true friendship helps us to go further in life, it pushes you, it awakens you from the endless nightmare that life has taken you.

In the end i would like to appreciate the fabulous work of Robin Williams that was sensational in speech,action,gestures he is truly an ace that was played in this great movie!.",10
3 June 2003,"An authentic, moving, honest classic","This is one of the most genuine movies i've ever seen. It's not perfect - on the contrary, it feels kind of rough. But it's just a really honest movie. You can tell it wasn't polluted by the big budget Hollywood mentality like so many movies nowadays are. Although I'm skeptical that this movie really deserves a 10 from an artistic perspective, I don't regret my vote, because I think this movie is the embodiment of what moviemaking is all about. It tells an incredible, human story in an honest, deep, and very enthralling fashion. Also, I think the acting is just amazing, *especially* by Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and Minnie Driver. I think it's great that Affleck and Damon wrote the script and followed through with getting it made... Definitely a movie worth watching, for casual moviegoers and hardcore movie buffs alike.

26 June 2005,An eye opening picture.,"This is one of the most powerful and pertinent movies of my generation's time. Matt Damon's portrayal of an abused kid growing up in an impoverished neighborhood in foster care is a most accurate depiction of the consequences of our broken society. The representation of abuse is painfully on target and the intensity of Will's intelligence and his perspective on that pain is enough to bring the viewer to tears. I have seen this movie probably 30 times and every time it still captures the same feeling within me, a feeling of motivation, of activation to intervene in the lives of real kids that exist in a world just like Will Hunting's.

16 March 2015,Absolutely ingenious,"I'm imagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame of mind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket. Then there are the people calling it unrealistic. Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently. Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing! Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK. Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel. The script is one of the best I've ever seen. The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, 'get in touch with your inner Robin Williams'. But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board. Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells. Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines 'Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?' 'Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it. Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will! I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms. But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast. It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream. Let them watch this 'chewing gum for the mind' and we discerning few will lap up the droplets of quality cinema.",7
24 April 2004,not that great,"I enjoyed this movie because I lived my whole life in Boston, not Southie but a different neighborhood. I enjoyed seeing the scenery that I am familiar with. Look, there is no way anyone who is a genius will work as a janitor. There are people who are smart or have potential who are also very lazy. But even the most brilliant people can't read books that fast or memorize everything. Remember the bar scene where he embarrasses that Harvard kid? The guy didn't look or act like a Harvard kid. He looked more like an MIT student, a science geek. Many Ivy Leaguers are liberal and would be friendly to a poor bum. In real life, Harvard students protested so the low-wage workers at their school can get better pay. Then Matt Damon's character knows every quote from a book in a battle of intelligence with the guy. Give me a break! It's possible that he would be smarter in many ways, but not with deep subjects. It's only a movie though.

27 April 2004,My Favorite Drama,"As a Christian I try my hardest not to watch movies that have no moral value. From the previews I was eager to see Good Will Hunting, however from word of mouth I heard that it was full of cussing and violence. Well the rumors got the best of me and tragically I did not see this wonderful movie until a little over a year ago. My friend Maggie told me I had to see it that she watched it on tv. Maggie being my best friend, I listened. I rented the movie and watched it. WOW! I have never been so impressed with a movie in all my movie watching life. (And I watch ALOT of movies.) This movie is the best written, best acted, best directed, and best depiction of real human emotion I've seen to date. Not only does it deal with actual problems that go deeper than ""I'm in love with Bobby but he loves Barbra Anne!"" but it also shows how a real human being would deal with these problems. Truthfully this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and honstly yes there is a considerable amount of cussing and there is some violence. Still I would recomend this flick to any one of my friends, Christian or not. Well there's my two cents, don't spend it all in one palce now.",10

26 November 2016,Beautiful movie,"It's interesting to look back a movie that was produced almost 20 years back - pure luck browsing through Netflix! The plot is simple but soul-touching. Matt Damon was so young and handsome back then! He perfectly portrayed the role of a genius but confused young man. Although it is somehow hard to believe that there is actually someone born with that kind of gift. The personality of the character is not attractive at the beginning, but with the help from the psychologist, he eventually opened up himself and was able to live up following his heart. The ending is beautiful. Guess there is no exception before true love.

24 August 2014,Great Will Hunting,"Gus Van Sant first caught my attention when I sat down with some friends to watch ""Last Days"", a biographical movie about the final days of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. The movie was beautifully done, with many long and winding scenes shot in single takes that seemed to capture Cobain's final environment and mindset perfectly. It wouldn't be long before I would see his similarly styled drama ""Elephant"" about the events leading up to a school shooting. I knew he directed ""Good Will Hunting"" but somehow its taken me 17 years to finally sit down to watch it in its entirety, and I am so glad I finally was able to scratch this gem-- number 130 on the IMDb top 250-- off of the list.

Hot-headed adult orphan Will Hunting (Matt Damon) leads a pretty normal life for a South Boston reprobate: between his janitorial job at MIT and getting shmacked with his buddies (Ben and Casey Affleck) at his local watering hole, Will is pretty unremarkable‚Äîexcept that he's a genius, an inexplicable phenom that has a wealth of knowledge about many topics, but due to his hard-knocks upbringing, never had any substantial education. When he starts surreptitiously solving the complex equations that are posted in the MIT halls to challenge the students, he catches the attention of mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard). Gerry learns that Will is in trouble with the law, and is able to make a plea with the judge: In leau of jail time, Will has to study mathematics with Gerry and go to routine therapy. After many failed attempts with a number of therapists, Gerry calls on his former college roommate and psychology professor, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to help. After butting heads initially, Will and Sean start to slowly solve the one problem that Will can't‚Äîhis own internal struggle.

This film is a wonderful examination of love, manhood, and socioeconomic status set to a gorgeous soundtrack (Danny Elfman). The relationship between Damon and Williams is priceless and powerful, beautifully scripted and masterfully executed (Williams won the Oscar that year for Best Supporting Actor with this role), and the addition of Minnie Driver is, to me, the icing on the proverbial cake. She is a beautiful and quirky addition to the cast and she and Damon are comfortable and charismatic together (her character was based on Damon's then girlfriend who left him for Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich just before filming). The script is a taut psychological ballet, with some of the best monologues I've heard in a good long while (Damon's rant about hitting the hash pipe and joining the National Guard especially!) To be completely honest, I think that the addition of the Affleck brothers brought this picture down a peg, though not nearly enough to weigh it down in a major way.",9

11 December 2014,Drugstore Cowboy,"Towering performance by Matt Damon in the lead, and a superlative ensemble headed by a terrific Robin Williams, elevate ""Good Will Hunting,"" Gus Van Sant's emotionally involving psychological drama, a notch or two above the mainstream therapeutic sensibility of its story.

Emanuel Levy A towering performance by Matt Damon in the lead, and a superlative ensemble headed by a terrific Robin Williams, elevate ""Good Will Hunting,"" Gus Van Sant's emotionally involving psychological drama, a notch or two above the mainstream therapeutic sensibility of its story. Centering on a brilliant working-class youngster who's forced to come to terms with his creative genius and true feelings, this beautifully realized tale is always engaging and often quite touching. With the right marketing, Miramax could score big with an extremely enjoyable picture whose old-fashioned virtues should play well in big cities as well as in Middle American shopping malls.

Fans of Van Sant's earlier, offbeat films may be disappointed by the more conventional attributes of ""Good Will Hunting,"" a ""problem"" drama dealing with the complex relationship between a rough, extraordinarily gifted kid and his equally troubled and bruised therapist. Thematically, film recalls Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" and especially Jodie Foster's ""Little Man Tate,"" which also revolved around a child genius of the working class.

Nonetheless, it's a testament to Van Sant's idiosyncratic talent that he endows the narrative, particularly its first chapters, with the nihilistic humor and deceptively casual style that have marked his best work, ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and the more eccentric ""My Own Private Idaho.""

Co-written by thesps Damon and Ben Affleck, who have known each other since childhood in Boston, protagonist is Will Hunting (Damon), a 20-year-old lad who works as a janitor at MIT and spends most of his time with his coarse friends at the neighborhood bar. Blessed with a certain genius, Will, who has never attended college, can summon obscure historical references based on his exceptional photographic memory. He can also solve difficult mathematical problems with an ease that makes MIT's richer and more educated students envious of him.",

12 January 2017,A mildly inspiring movie with solid writing,"Good Will Hunting is a great film with an inspiring message. As I was watching this film for the first time in seventh grade, I felt extremely empowered and emotional. I'm sure I wouldn't have the same reaction now, but this film holds a very special nostalgic place in my memory.

The movie is very quotable, with famous lines like "" you like apples"", etc. The story can be clich√© at times, but it overall it does this to be as relate able as possible, similar to the book the alchemist. Overall, I felt this film is a 9/10, because of it's nostalgic value, good writing, and solid jokes.

17 October 2006,One of my favorites of all time.,"Simply put - excellent writing, excellent directing, and excellent acting. They got it all right, and amazingly the lexicon and feeling of S. Boston ""Southie"". A must see for any fan of classics or modern excellence. The cast was superb, and I particularly enjoyed the interaction between Will Hunting and his friends. Very true to form, and full of real dialogue and overall interaction (that makes you feel you are a fly on the wall). Minnie Driver was a ""knock out"" and her acting was perfect for the role and mood of the film. Finally, Robin Williams added stability and a real sense of humility to the film to ground it fully in the pit of your heart and stomach. What else can I say? A film you can watch over and over again - repeat the lines, and still go back for more.

15 October 1998,One of the best movies of the decade? It goes beyond that......,"First of all, Good Will Hunting is the best movie I've ever seen. Period. It has such a moving plot, and all the main characters, (Driver, Damon, etc.) did a great job. I saw Good Will Hunting first in a motel room, and have seen it many times after that and will probably buy it soon. Anybody who hasn't seen this movie has to see it as long you're not offended by bad language, something this movie has a LOT of. It's the best movie I've ever seen, it should have won the Best Picture Oscar, and anyone who hasn't seen it HAS to see it. Period.

4 October 1998,"Despite the strong language, an excellent script and complex characters.","As a film buff coming from a conservative background, I find myself struggling to evaluate honestly films containing strong language, particularly when it appears in such abundance as in this film. But, bearing in mind that such language is endemic to the principal characters in the film, I found myself thoroughly entranced by Will's character development throughout the film. The script and attendant dialogue carry the viewer along logically, both with respect to Will but also the Robin Williams character. The development of these two fully-realized characters as their interactions cross provides real insight into the complexities of human nature. The supporting roles of the maths professor and the Minnie Driver characters only add to the painful but honest reality of this film.

16 September 1998,"A wonderful, dialogue driven coming of age story","Personally, I found this movie to be a refreshing change from movies we see nowadays. Before seeing it I thought the basic premise was nothing new but Robin Williams might make it an interesting movie. I was delightedly surprised. Matt Damon pulled off a magnificent performance in a not-so-new character type. I found the plot to be a wonderful vehicle for the outstanding dialogue that made the movie so rewatchable for me. The screenplay absolutely deserved the Oscar. Robin Williams had easily one of the best performances of his career (at least as powerful as Dead Poet's Society if not more so). He poured a lot of emotion into a character just as complicated as Damon's. The connection between Williams' character and Damon's was powerful. Minnie Driver delivered a wonderful performance as Damon's love interest. Stellan Skaarsgard, though I don't recall another movie he has been, also played a complicated role as sort of a mental mentor to Damon. But my hat is off to Ben Affleck. This was the first movie I saw him in and his presence on screen was amazing. He is responsible for possibly my favorite scene in the movie, the scene where he tells Will Hunting that he doesn't ""owe it to himself, you owe it to me."" I believe he took the role as best friend to a new level. He also has a wonderful scene where he has to basically just stand there and let us know what is going on in his mind. I hope to see him around a lot in the future. This movie is wonderfully cast and brought me back again and again.",10
23 November 1998,Realism and fantasy blended with snappy dialogue,"GWH stands out as soon as the actors breathe their first lines of dialogue, Matt Damon's character has been given some of the sparkiest lines in recent memory. Overall the language used is in keeping with the location and the setting in both the upper (Harvard) and lower (South Boston) parts of the city.

I am really amazed about the number of complaints about the use of colourful language, this sort of dialogue is necessary to portray Will and friends realistically, to leave it out would be like taking the soldiers out of Saving Private Ryan or the food out of Babette's Feast.

Let's not be too hard on the writers for using a well used plot line, in the end everything is derivative and the story does offer an excellent portrayal of the way success is measured, the loneliness experienced by the intellectually gifted and how knowledge does not necessarily guarantee wisdom.

12 February 1999,The best movie I have ever seen.,"This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.The containment of showing the life of a young man, but showing how and what they do and go through in life. This one of the few movies that actually made me cry. This is what I consider a movie that you can relate or connect to yourself. I wish the movie companies would more movies like this.

23 October 1999,"Language Shmanguage, this movie rules!","All of the people who commented on the language are obviously older, and while I can understand them finding the use of the f-word offensive, words are just words. And I felt that the word showed the roots and background of the characters in the movie who used it. It was honest. Robin Williams gave a wonderful performance, he shows great depth as a dramatic as well as comedic actor in this movie. I was impressed by Matt Damon, I had been prepared to not like him because of all the hype. And Ben Affleck was, of course, gorgeous and wonderful as always.

13 July 1999,Not very original story ????,"Every movie has a theme that has been used before in a movie. Only after you have seen this movie completely the behaviour of Will starts to make sense. And even than, the depth of his troubled life isn't totally clear. This movie is full of mental challenges. Brilliant written conversations constantly change your perspective to the story. In a nutshell: bit by bit you start to understand you can't possibly understand what Will's life is about.

30 August 1999,Wonderful film with overuse of bad language.,"I don't usually mind the ""F"" word, but the use in this movie makes it embarrasing to watch with others. Not a family film. Wonderfully acted, it's a film with very good feeling.. but impossible to recommend to friends because of the language.. really sad not to be able to do so.

15 November 1999,Was a very good movie!,"Good Will Hunting was a very good movie, the actors played a tremendous role and Matt Damon was great. He was a very convincing and played a very good role as a Math genesis. Robin Williams was great and they could not have picked a better person to play this movie. I don't think that is was overrated and the use of F-word was not that bad. Any movie is going to have that word in it. This was probably in my top 5 list as best movies of all time. I would rate it as: 8 1/2 out of 10.

26 December 1999,Deep on many levels,"I don't often comment on films, just vote, but this one got to me in so many ways. I had to see it three times and speak to 10+ friends before I figured it out. We all see a little of us in one of these people and it is a little scary. A friend pointed out my similar problems with relationships as Will in the movie.

A wonderfully written, (can they repeat?) great acting, and it makes you think. What more can you want. Rent it, watch it twice, and think about it.

this film was spectacular. well written, well acted, and a fine directorial job by gus van zant. there's nothing ho-hum about ""Good Will"" and the fact that Will is a genius only adds to the dramatic tension and raises the stakes. this film deserved the two academy awards it received, and then some.

19 April 2006,To: Critics,"There was an individual who talked about the unbelievability of this Movie, how Will was a math prodigy with only little formal education. He also said it isn't logical because he himself was a math God, and he would know. Well, to you, get over yourself, the movie was great! Go bowling With Professor Lambeau and have a nice conversation about ""exciting math theory."" I think it is definitely believable, hence the word PRODIGY. Some people don't like the fact that they aren't the smartest human being in the world. This upsets them, so they must claim ""fallacy"" to make themselves feel better. Yeah, Hollywood exaggerates, get used to it. Anyway, this movie is definitely a must see for anyone that can enjoy a movie without getting offended that there actually might be a genius in the world, and who can enjoy a beautifully made Film!

30 May 2019,My thoughts,"Good Will Hunting was a good movie, it shows that love can go a long way and in all different ways. Will Hunting double thinks but ends up going with his gut, i thought he should of went with the girl before she left. I see me in Will Hunting i double think but i go and get what i want, people judge Will even though they don't really know him people do that with me too. He has a different way of doing stuff and he's underestimated by others. People don't think Will Hunting knows what he's talking about or doing because he's younger than them. But Will Hunting actually knows what he's talking about and doing, he's a smart guy. It doesn't better how young you are if you actually know what your talking about don't listen to what people got to say. Age doesn't matter if you know what your talking about. Will Hunting is a person who doesn't care what people say about him he would still go and do anything to help himself. The only thing i didn't like was the cliffhanger in the end of the movie. I just wanted to see if he really made it to her or even to see if he married this girl. I rate this movie a 7, besides the ending i liked the whole movie. Will Hunting went with what his friends said they told him to go with his dreams without telling them when he's leaving and that's what he did. It was a great movie and i recommend this movie.",7
12 February 2001,"Has some potential, but overall, this film stinks!","This movie was hyped to be a great event. When it was in the theatres, everyone, including myself, went. I thought it stunk. I could barely keep myself awake. Watching Matt Damon did nothing for me, but I recall it did something for my date.........She liked him because he was cute. Don't get me wrong, I'm not putting this movie down because Matt Damon is cute, but I really didn't find anything too redemptive, exciting, or inspiring in this movie. If you're fortunate enough to have missed this one, let it go.

13 November 2019,Young excellence,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is.

21 April 2001,Amazing :),"This movie was so important in so many ways and it touched me deep inside. It was not overrated at all- hello it came out in the year of Titanic. I think it deserved Best Picture. It also launched the careers of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. (I love both- but Ben is awesome). They are both very talented and deserved all the credit they got. And Robin Williams ends up winning an Oscar with one of his only serious roles. How ironic? He gave the best performance of his career. Although Ben and Matt wrote it and everything- Robin just stole the picture. It wouldn't have been the same without his portrayal of Sean Maguire.

This was the feel-good movie of the year and just such a great story. You all should agree.

25 January 2008,awesome!,"i read an article about the ""Good Will Hunting"" in reader's digest as i fumble through the very late issues of the magazine as i had a time to sit down and relax in the midst of my nocturnal habits.so, when i got a chance to spend 126 minutes to it, i did not let it pass.

the best highlights of this movie are the performance of the two best actors-Damon and Williams. the conflict between the characters propelled the story to its incredible turning point.

the ever searching truth about life was explained in its very drastic way, yet unbearable.

the best contender for Titanic that time.how i wish titanic was not released on that year.

this film speaks of the truth about life -frustrations and triumphs.

28 December 2006,"excellent writing, great acting all around awesome movie","Not only are Matt Damon and Ben Affleck great actors they're great writers. The writing for the movie was brilliant, it kept my mind wondering what was going to happen next the whole time. Robin Willimas gave one of his best performances yet. I feel as if Matt Damon was not acting but mearly having his everyday life taped for us to see, that is is how convincing he was in playing the part of math pridgy Will Hunting. To those that have not seen Good Will Hunting, I suggest that you see it as soon as humanly possible. If you like a great stroy, with actors he give an even better performance, Good Will Hunting was made just for you.

8 April 2023,A Perception Enhancing Enlightenment.,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

28 November 2001,This movie has everything it takes to be an all-time favorite.,"Now here's a movie to remember. A fine story, some great acting and realism at it's best. When I look at this movie, time and time again, I get carried away every time.

The conversations are high-standing, yet completely ""every-day talk"" and common. No fine script-scentenses here, only regular dialog. This makes the movie more realistic than some other drama's. And the way story's are told; pure genius... Think for example of the way Sean talks about his wife, or Chuck tells about his uncle. And, really brilliant: Seans monolog in the park...

The acting is (dare I say it?) perfect, or at least very close to that term. The expressions on faces, the body-language, everyting. Very clear about the film is everybody's position in the movie. Every person has his own personality, and it's very clear what their motives are.

Another apect that is very well worked out is the story. Not just a regular story, but a fine recognisable plot. Very great are the things Sean and Will have in common; their past, their fear of loving an(other) woman and so on.

Then there is the symbolism. This too is something they really thought about while making this movie. For exemple; Sean keeps buying this lottery ticket but never wins anything. They talk about the odds of winning a price. This refers to the great gift Will has; he symbolicly has a winning ticket, which is his gift. Or think about the way Will tries to figure Sean out by looking at his painting. Here he switchs roles with Sean, as he starts to ""see through"" the shrink, in stead of the other way around.

So there are plenty of aspects which are pretty good thought through... Nothing to complain about, if you ask me. A movie to remember forever!",9
17 January 2022,WOW!,"Deep emotional film I just personally identify a lot with some of the stories in this movie.

Just a great movie all-around with some great performances.

19 January 2022,Ideal,"""Clever Will Hunting"" is the picture where everything is fine and there is not even anything to find fault with. Here, a thoughtful script filled with capacious dialogues is combined with an amazing acting game.

One of the most important problems of humanity at all times is raised here: love or success? For some reason, few people managed to combine these two important components and achieve absolute happiness. So the hero of the picture named Will at one point faced a difficult choice that would become fateful and determine his life path until his death. Such a scenario turn is good because the audience of ""Clever Will Hunting"" will always be divided into two camps. And this is great, because the film will remain in the memory for many years in this way.

26 March 2023,The Best,"The Good: I love how every character had an affect on one another. Sean taught Will how to be vulnerable, and how not to be scared to reach out and risk something every once and a while. Sean realizes that he needs to continue to move forward in his life, even though he thinks the best years are in the past, he can still go out and try to find more happiness.

I love the type of personality that the main characters bring to the script. They are quick and interesting while still seeming realistic and flawed. Obviously, these flaws are the main premise and a big reason that I keep coming back.

The ending nicely suggests the future for both Sean and Will without feeling like it needs to continue to be elaborated on or made longer.

The Bad: Will's intentions when he met with Sean seemed slightly different than when he met with the other therapists. The first few seemed like he just didn't care and was making jokes, but when he met with Sean it felt like his goal was to attack his morals and ideals.

Will is way too wicked smart. The story wouldn't be possible without this though.",10

25 June 2005,"Fantastic, thats it !","The movie is an ultimate piece of drama. All of the cast has done an excellent job and Matt Demon and Robin Williams deserve all the kudos. Matt has portrayed a cocky genius and he seems to be born for the role. So is Robin Williams. The movie is absolutely immaculate except for one technical error that Will (Matt Demon) introduces Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck) as his brother to Skylar (Minnie Driver) and she believes the lie. If you have seen the movie fairly attentively(which you are compelled to - its so encapsulating), you must have noticed that when Will first meets skylar in a club, Chuckie is also with him and when Will gets into an argument with the pompous guy (I am not sure what his name is) on history knowledge, Skylar is present right there in the scene. Will says to the guy something like ""You are trying to impress some girls and embarrass my FRIEND"". Now if I was Skylar and I was as brainy as her (she is shown to be quiet a brainy person - at least thats what i feel), I would not have forgotten that Chuckie is Will's friend and would not have fooled by the lie which Will tells her later and introduces Chuckie as his brother.

But this critical evaluation is uncalled for as this is not a mystery where all the events should concatenate properly. The movie is just superb and is a must see for everyone. It reveals Will's character (of a prodigy who does not like to be vulnerable to anything) with tremendous success and deserves the rating IMDb has given it.",8

4 November 2006,Pedagogical Travesty,"This movie epitomizes a dysfunctional belief that people are born gifted and humankind's ultimate endeavor should be seeking out these blessed few and grovelling at their beatific feet. Baloney! Greatness comes from hard work. Anyone that tells you differently is trying to pull a fast one on you. It's only poor teachers that complain that their students are not bright enough. Marva Collins sent ordinary and problem students to the best schools. Find and and reward good teachers. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't have what it takes, least of all a moronic Hollywood vehicle for pretty boy spoiled brats. Do the math!

12 July 2003,added facts about the movie,"I am a full-time sculptor living and working from my studio in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Over ten years ago I moved to Northern California where I met, at a gallery opening, the American Poet William Leach. We fell in glorious love and eventually moved through New Mexico, Iowa and to Canada where he died at age 45 years of age, 6 years after I met him, we were married in hospital one year before his death. While in California he told me the story of his life including a story about being a janitor and some of the 'events' that happened during that time, he also mentioned that later friends had spoken to him about the interest in making a movie about his life, which he had no interest in, in fact the chaos this would have caused in his very private and reclusive life as a poet. Later when we were living in Iowa a friend said we had to see a very wonderful movie about a 'genius janitor' and told us the basic story of the movie. We both were in shock! This was the movie, years later, about William's life at that time. He was never able to watch the movie although he tried, but tears would stream down his face, and when I finally asked him, gently why he cried, and why he could not watch the movie, besides seeing all his friends depicted and recalling that time of his life in such detail, he replied, ""I had so much to offer and I was pushing a broom"". And we never spoke of it again. I think it is important that people know at some point in history that the movie was based on a real person, a very amazing person of great personal strength, a beautiful person filled with love for the world he lived in, and such a gifted poet. He wrote 6 books of poetry, all remain unpublished, he received news of 7 poems to be published in Descant, in Canada, the day after his death. If anyone has any interest in contacting me to learn more about this man, a Renaissance of splender and joy, please contact me, he was the 'genius janitor' depicted in the movie, ""Good Will Hunting"", and his name was William Leach, poet. Thank you! Susan Murar.",
13 July 2003,movie back to the basics of greatness,"I viewed some of the previous reviews, where people seem to have a very off view of this movie, and that may be because of the big named actors in the film. I vote this movie as a 9, there is no justification to rate it at a 1. This film was not sent to be made because of damon and affleck, but is what made the famous to begin with. So please, thank the academy, and if you want to see a film with humor, drama, a bit of fighting, with a touch of love and friendship. See this film.

30 April 2011,"People who pursue an endeavor and lack the passion needed for fulfilling their venture, inevitably fail to generate success regardless of their talent.","Working as a janitor at MIT, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) enjoys spending time with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Billy McBride (Cole Hauser), and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck). From the slums of South Boston, Will is a diamond in the ruff, as he possesses natural intellectual capabilities far beyond what is typically achieved from any formal education. Despite his extraordinary intellect, Will is haunted by a long history of self inflicted legal problems. After unintentionally exposing his raw talent for mathematics, Will is approached by Fields Medal winning Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) who offers to resolve Will's pending legal issues in exchange for two things: his assistance in solving mind-bending mathematical equations and his agreeing to speak with a therapist. With the unwavering determination of therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Will is forced to uncover the secrets from his haunting past, confront his current misguided motivations and pressing relationship issues with lover Skylar (Minnie Driver), and evaluate the possibilities for his future.

Good Will Hunting is a film that really drives home the idea that people who pursue an endeavor and lack the passion needed for fulfilling their venture, inevitably fail to generate success regardless of their talent. With the rallying support of those closest to him, Will remains uninterested in the countless opportunities he is presented through professional connections of Professor Lambeau, to do little more than use his highly evolved gift of intellect. Will's commitment to friends and his constant strive for self preservation are the only passions that drive his daily existence. He views his photographic memory and ability to solve the most complex of mathematical equations a burden, and uses his ingenuity only for personal gain or getting himself out of a sticky situation.

Will's lack of interest in mathematics and defiant attitude towards the use of his incredible mind baffles and frustrates Professor Lambeau, as is boldly illustrated with the following remark to Will: ""Sometimes I wish I had never met you. Because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing there was someone like you out there"". Lambeau drops to his knees just prior to this line, and is looking up at Will who is standing in front of the Professor's door. The camera angle suggests that perhaps for the very first time, Lambeau feels inferior to someone who possesses no academic credentials or scholarly achievements. This is a significant and telling moment in the film since Lambeau proudly measures his success by the outstanding awards he has received over the course of his career.

Lambeau spends his days living and breathing his love for mathematics. He has earned a Fields Medal and is highly regarded for his work. The Professor's self proclaimed success is, in his eyes, evident from the many awards he has received for his triumphs in mathematics. Similarly, therapist Sean Maguire considers himself a success in his own right. He draws upon his relationship with his wife and pursuing a career that he truly enjoys as being the factors that have made him a success. The noteworthy achievements for each of these men stem not from their intellect or unique talent alone; the passion they have for their work has led to their success.

The very powerful message of what it means to be successful, and what it takes to get there, is carried from scene-to-scene throughout the entire film. Will Hunting is forced to expose his internal demons long enough to sift through years of baggage and determine what ignites his passion. Perhaps the most telling evidence that an insightful internal breakthrough is about to occur happens during the fourth therapy session with Sean, after Will had refused to speak to the therapist for the second week in a row. Very light music is the only audible sound at the beginning of the scene which then slowly fades into Sean whistling softly followed by a sudden silence. This brief moment of silence catches the attention of the audience directly before Will decides to finally speak. This dead track is strategically placed in this scene to draw attention to the fact that a change in relationship has occurred between the two characters. It also symbolizes an end to the fear of personal exploration that has prevented Will from facing his life head on, and finally puts to rest his days of cowering behind excerpts from an encyclopedia.

Like so many people in the world today, Will Hunting spent twenty years of his life content with simply going through the motions of day-to-day life. Regardless of his incredible talent, there was no self proclaimed success because his talents were not his passion. Simply put, the foundation necessary for achieving success was nonexistent. Passion is not difficult to come by, but one must be willing to embrace their inner most desires and perhaps set aside their talents to proclaim to the world that their journey through life has been a success. Good Will Hunting brilliantly brings to light the dark side of success and the limitations of talent.",

Well ,first i was thought that this movie was simple as any other movie,but when i seen it,it totally blown my mind away.Matt Damon and Robin Williams us great as always.

the movie shows how a psychiatrist helps a genius boy to believe in himself and discover the meaning of life.

Robin play a Oscar worthy performance once again and Matt and Ben also well deserved the Oscar for screenplay.

Highly recommended to anyone.

19 December 2003,for the cynics,"some of you have taken great pleasure in pointing out the negative things in this film (e.g. will's arrogance, etc.)...but I think a positive look at the philosophy behind some of the ideas may just give us some practical advice to how ""the good life"" can be spent...my favorite scene is in the meeting room with robin williams and matt damon where they both harp on each other for using a ""super-philosophy"" for merely surviving through our self-protecting mode of existence. Robin Williams' excuse was that he had already played his cards and doesn't regret a minute of the time he spent with his wife despite the great pain he feels now. Matt Damon is in utter confusion, not knowing how to commit to anything in a serious manner; instead pushes everything out of his life as a defense mechanism. It can be said that both use this super-philosophy to supress what could be a genuinely lively and thriving future, as a means to not love to the fullest potential. How can a person live life abundantly without ever putting themselves in a position which risk is involved? In my opinion its impossible. Is this what you gather from the ""super-philosophy"" scene? let me know what you think...

I am one of those people that reads the 'User Reviews' and if your like me, we for whatever reason let them affect us whether good or bad. When I am stuck deciding between two movies I'll check the reviews and pretty much let that persuade me either way......AND I HATE THAT I LET IT HAPPEN!! We let ratings and reviews by complete strangers who have zero qualifications, make our decisions for us. I am as guilty as anyone. We have to stop listening to these FUN-HATING EBERT WANNABES who get their rocks off by writing these essay long reviews that contain nothing but BS. I feel sorry for those people that cannot watch a movie and enjoy it for what it is....a freaking movie. People who question the accuracy of FICTIONAL subject matter are sad, it's fiction get over it. I read a review someone wrote about how Matt Damon's character, who is a genius, all they complained about was how genius was misplayed and that a genius couldn't do this or they should do that so they rated 1/10 because they were so hurt by it. Don't let people who are mad at the world who don't get enjoyment out of life ruin what will be a very enjoyable movie experience.

14 March 2004,"A Masterpiece, one of my favourite movies of all time","Good Will Hunting, a breakthrough for actor Ben Affleck. In Good Will Hunting we see the cunning, snappy remarks made by all the lead actors Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver. This movie shows a good template for what every movie needs, good writing, acting, directing, and a well though title. If anyone deserves an award for memorizing dialouge it's Matt Damon spitting out that huge speech in the one job interview scene. Also this film is known for the winning of the two Oscars which were Best Original Screen Play and Best Supporting Actory which was Robin Williams, a well deserved award for that matter. Good Will Hunting recieves a perfect 10 for me.

Trouble never seems to be far behind him when choices are steered in the wrong direction. No longer being of free will to make his own decisions, the only choice for Will is to be placed in a state penitentiary or to complete psychiatric therapy for his anger management issues. Determining a correct path in his life is not the only decision which Will must face as a young adult, but it can be one of the toughest. While facing the judicial system, Will must make his anger work for him, not against him. This is a huge obstacle in maintaining friendships while trying to reinvent himself. Will has the potential to become an elite mathematician, but instead uses his free will to experience his own road in life. Although choice is a powerful tool, unless used to the fullest positive potential, it can possibly back-fire. Decisions are faced everyday in each of our lives, but some of us take for granted the gift of decision and free will. While being given a great gift one could consider Will as a man with potential, but no desire or initiative. One might consider this the ultimate dilemma in life. The realistic `view of the working-class' is portrayed throughout the movie, providing a sense of belonging to the millions who fall in this category. The setting was a bit predictable, which led watchers to feel the connectedness. The dialogue might be appealing to a younger generation, who use vulgar words to express themselves, versus an older generation who find this repulsive. All in all, I give this movie an A-.",
15 August 2013,"Definitely Good ""Will Hunting"" ..","The movie is an absolute genius in terms of screenplay and performances. Robin Williams is the best of the lot.

Not only it binds one into the strong narrative but also compels to think for a while about personalities. No one in the movie is wrong or negative, not even prof. Gerald Lambeau :). It's all about perspectives, about believing that raw fish tastes good (what's good for you might not be the same for all)

The rating might seem a little prejudiced to some, me being a big fan of Robin Williams :), but the movie definitely deserves a 10/10. Enjoy the show folks .. :)

21 November 2019,Brilliant and Sobre,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",7
19 December 2005,Under-rated music,"This is an excellent film for reasons mentioned elsewhere, but what I would like to add is a comment about the wonderful music that accompanies the film. The songs are written by Elliott Smith, who was truly an under-rated song-writer. I would urge everyone who enjoyed this film to go out and buy his album Either/Or, you will not regret it. His softly sung love songs add perfectly to the overall feel of the film. Elliott Smith subsequently played a song from the film at the Oscars ceremony, a somewhat bizarre scenario as he was a quiet and reserved man, somewhat out of place in that environment. Tragically he died in 2003, but his music lives on as an inspiration.

3 October 2004,great movie,"this movie really captured the true meaning of life i think. not like other movies where the main character is tough and strong and can handle anything Matt Damon showed that every person (even a genius) doesn't know everything. i would definitely recommend it as a must see movie because it is sad, funny, and inspiring. its a true piece of work and the interaction between the characters is phenomenal. Robbin Williams also was an excellent actor in this movie. you could see he really cared for will. i think this is one of the most touching movies i have ever seen in my entire life. i just hope that Matt Damon will sometime in the future do another wonderful movie like this.

5 February 2013,Masterfully develops complex relationships,"The script for Good Will Hunting was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who both star in the movie. Damon plays the lead role of Will Hunting and Affleck plays his best friend, Chuckie Sullivan. The theme of the film is a focus on ideas, specifically the complexity of human relationships and social problems. It is surprisingly complex considering the age of the two young writers.

Will Hunting is a street-wise Boston kid whose childhood memories involve foster homes and abuse. His daily life involves cruising the streets, hanging out in the local bar and looking for fights. He is employed as a custodian at the prestigious M.I.T.

The audience is unaware of Will's photographic memory and genius status until he solves a mathematical problem on an M.I.T. hallway chalkboard that even the most respected M.I.T. professor cannot solve. Ultimately there are four people who try to save Will from his destructive life style. Professor Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, Sean McGuire, played by Robin Williams, Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, and Chuckie Sullivan.

Upon realizing that the custodian solved the elusive mathematical equation, Lambeau reaches out to help Hunting. He agrees to intervene on behalf of the youth, promising a judge he will provide guidance and counseling in exchange for keeping Hunting from jail. After exhausting numerous counselors, Lambeau turns to college friend, Sean McGuire, to counsel Hunting. McGuire and Lambeau have their own complicated relationship stemming from their college days which resurfaces with their rekindled acquaintance.

McGuire begins to reach Hunting and seems to be making some progress. Hunting begins a relationship with Harvard student, Skylar, who also challenges him to open up and be honest about his past. As these relationships develop, Hunting can no longer hide from the intimacy that up until now he has so craftily dodged. As a result, when Skylar encourages Hunting to come to California with her, he breaks off the relationship.

Hunting refuses to make a career decision after multiple interviews with think tanks set up by Professor Lambeau. McGuire pushes Hunting during their next counseling session about what he wants to do with his life. When Hunting reverts to his old methods of dodging questions, McGuire tells him to leave.

Having now removed the individuals who were encouraging him to change his destructive pattern, Hunting returns to work with Chuckie on a construction site. At this point Chuckie becomes the fourth person to tell Hunting he had to take advantage of his gift. The outcome is predictable. Hunting returns to McGuire to mend their falling out and then heads off to find Skylar.

The camera work in this film was very well done and assists Director, Gus Van Sant, capture the complexity of the characters' relationships. One particular scene worth noting is a scene of McGuire and Hunting on a park bench by a pond. McGuire is opening up to Hunting about the loss of his wife and the love he had for her. This was the first session in which McGuire appears to crack Hunting's hard shell. The camera remained on the face of McGuire as he told his story. The camera does not move to incorporate Will until McGuire is done with his intimate sharing. All attention, including Hunting's, was focused on McGuire during his testimony.

A second piece of camera work captured Hunting allowing his protective walls to break down is a scene where he and Skylar are at a street caf√©. Their relationship has peaked at this point and one can clearly see they have fallen in love. The camera work completely focuses in on their faces, sharing an intimate moment with the audience.

This film gave both Williams and Damon the opportunity of a more challenging role. Each exceeded my expectation of their performance. Few films do this well in developing relationships although some might point to the film Beaches as another which successfully focuses on the complexity of relationships. This is a well written film only surpassed by its acting which is sure to please even the most critical movie-goer.",10
21 May 2020,This lost best picture to who???,"Is a well deserved 10/10.Amazing performances, casting, character development and writing. Robin Williams is the stand out by far in the movie and his chemistry with Matt Damon makes the movie hit a whole new level. Will continue to rewatch over and over for the smart dialogue, great character chemistry and a great ending

22 September 2013,Good Will Hunting Review,"I saw Good Will Hunting when it first came out in theaters; I was blown away by the story line. The screen writing is of a caliber unknown. Although the story is predictable in places, it presents a feel good approach. When the movie is over, you feel happy. Good Will Hunting does not leave you dumbfounded or begging for more because it delivers on all aspects. The chemistry between the characters is out of this world. The casting was spot on; everyone fits into their roles perfectly.

I watched this movie with my mom and she cried at the very end. My mom was happy that Will finally made peace and moved on to a better life. Also, we were relieved that he ended up with Minnie Driver in the end. The movie is happy, feel good entertainment that all adults can enjoy.

18 April 2013,I am speechless,"Well, I have to admit that it was an exceptional movie for me. I almost shed a tear. Fortunately, I am not a faggy faggot so I do not cry while watching movies. But seriously- the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. The emotions that were depicted in the movie seem to be extremely real and thanks to great actors (esp. affleck bros, Damon) I could feel them (those emotions) too. I recommend a movie to anyone who wants something more than cheap, entertaining action movie. To sum up, the message is quite exceptional. We all think that, we are omnipotent when we reach a certain age (I do not think that he was 21 by accident. Although, the truth is that we can always learn from other people no matter what their education or background are. Simple message = great acting = 10 Thank You

10 December 2004,Excellent,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, and I am an outstanding judge of what is great and what sucks. Both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were very good. They were so at home with the roles I fell into the movie and there was not any point at which I said to myself ""that was lame"" which is what I spend about 80% of my waking hours doing, I think I may even do this in my dreams. Oh yes and a big shout out to Robin Williams who I generally dislike, he is also very good in this movie. I know one person that did not like this movie and she is a little off in general, nice person but her taste in movies is absurd. Some of my male friends think I'm a bit light in the loafers for trumpeting this picture to whomever will stand still and listen. Despite this I think this is one of the greatest pictures ever made.

4 August 2013,Good Will Hunting is about a genius in mathematics who works as a janitor for MIT.,"The theme of Good Will Hunting I believe is personal discovery. Good Will Hunting is about a simple janitor named Will working for MIT. However Will is not just another janitor, he is a mathematical genius that solves mathematical equations that have been written on the chalk boards in the classrooms that the other students are unable to solve. When the professor of mathematics sees these solutions done by Will he wants Will to start a job where he is able to use his gift in mathematics. Will however does not want to do this he wants to spend his life as a laborer.

Through the course of the movie Will also got arrested for getting in a fight and professor Lambeau (mathematics professor) gets Will released into his custody but only by Will agreeing to see a psychologist. Will ends up going through five psychologists before professor Lambeau is able to find one that Will connects with. Will also starts a relationship with a young lady named Skylar whom he meet in a bar. However when Skylar asks Will to move with her to another state Will threw a temper tantrum and breaks off the relationship, in an attempt to prevent future emotional pain. By the end of the movie after Will breaks down in his final therapy session with Sean. He then decides to go to find Skylar and make that relationship work. By working with Sean the psychologist Will was able to discover who he is and is able to move on from his past and start living the life that will make him happy. By doing this Will is then able to find his place in the world.

One motif that was repeated throughout the film that is related to the theme is Will going to see Sean the psychologist over and over aging. While Will is with Sean he is able to slowly discover who he is and where he fits into the world or where his place is with his friends and in his relationship with Skylar. Good will hunting also used internal conflict within Will to portray the theme of this movie. By Will having a bad childhood and allowing this to dictate his life throughout the movie it also showed us how Will's personal conflict made it hard for Will to really discover who he was or where he should be. However in the end Will was able to achieve that personal discovery of himself and move on in the world to a life that would be right for him without all the past conflict.",
15 January 2005,Gifted and neglected son of impoverished Boston neighborhood is found by Love.,"Good Will Hunting, a story of the profoundly gifted Will Hunting will resonate with all who still hunt for good will in the world. Stunning performances by the headliners; Driver, Daimon, Affleck, Williams, and those by actors not so well-known, make this original story by Daimon and Affleck unforgettable and real. Set across the disparate social contexts of the intellectual elite of MIT University and the impoverished blue collar world of South Boston, this story reveals that love, once again, transcends all. And love is its subject; the courtship, delights and follies of lovers, the love shared between men, the love for the natural beauty and truth revealed in science and mathematics, the platonic love between teacher and student, parent and child, and the violence and perversity of love betrayed.

This academy award-winning ""best original screenplay"" had a solid and natural up-bringing. Daimon and Affleck grew up in the widely diverse cultural context in which the story is set and their penetrating view of this world brings it credibility and importance.

In what is perhaps an unlikely assemblage of scenes and dialog, this classic story of struggle in pursuit of love and meaning is delivered by the strength and brilliance of the performances. In the end, its value, as entertainment and as art, derives from the truth of human nature embedded in it.",10
28 January 2014,An incredible and important piece of film making,"For those who have given a poor rating, let me share to you my reasons for dismissing these reviews.

To the critics who discredit the plausibility and refer to this masterpiece as a 'hype' movie, it is absurd. The concept of the unfulfilled young man making use of his life is about as classic protagonist story that can be thrown into any movie, but what this one did was take it to the next level by making a brilliantly creative character of a repeat-offender boy genius. However, this concept is merely a tool to enable the character and relationship development that occurs throughout the play (and gives lease to great characterization from Damon), therefore criticizing this plot point is criticizing possibly the least important aspect of the film. And as for a Hollywood hype film? Hey we're still discussing its quality nearly 20 years later.

9 April 2006,A Story Showing that the Best Special Effect is Real Human Emotion,"When I first saw Good Will Hunting, I thought it was a remarkable movie. It instantly went to my top ten list. But ""why is this movie so great?,"" you may ask. Well its the story about a mathematical genius who lives in a ""safe world where no one challenges him."" Every night he gets drunk with his buddies. One day he gets caught by the police for fighting and would have been sentenced to jail time, if it were not for an MIT professor who knows of his abilities and gets the judge to release. The conditions are that he must see a therapist and meet with Professor Lambough, the MIT professor, weekly to work on math studies. Will meets his match with a therapist (Robin Williams) and together they become friends and find solutions to life's hardest problems. A great movie, the best I've ever seen.

5 October 2017,What an amazing film,"When I first saw the begin of this film it didn't really interested me. I thought of it as a bit slow and only watched the first 20 minutes. Two days ago I gave it another try, because everyone keeps talking about it and it has an amazing high rating number on IMDb. And I must say; what was I an idiot for not watching the film in the first time.

I loved everything about this film. The performance of the actors (espacially Robin Williams of course), the story, the shots. It even made me cry at the end (and if a film makes you cry, you know it's a good one).

27 March 2005,I loved this movie,"I absolutely loved this movie. It is on my top 10 of all time favorites. The screenplay is original. I'm tired of watching the same movies with different actors, different titles over and over again. This one was truly original. It was long but went by so fast. I have now watched it at least 5 times and still haven't tired of it. The acting was also superb. Matt Damon at his best, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck hasn't been able to match his ability since. I highly recommend you to watch this and don't get the people who said they don't get what all the hype is about. The storyline, humanity and unrealistic expectations echo real life. The pain that the characters feel is also so real.

21 February 2014,Good Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting

The Oscar winning American drama Goodwill Hunting was released on December 5, 1997, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and directed by Gus Van Sant with a modest budget of 10 million dollars. The film was an instant success making $225,933,435 at the box office (imdb.com). The success of the movie did not come from fancy effects, or intense action scenes; however it is the script that captures the audience, which makes us, fall in love with the characters as well as the movie as a whole. The aspect of the movie that stood out the most to me was the excellent story line, which was beautifully executed by the phenomenal acting and powerful performances of the main characters, Affleck, Damon and along with the support of Robin Williams, who made this movie such a success. The script written by Damon and Affleck, won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, which did not surprise me. Damon began writing Good Will Hunting in his fifth year at Harvard in a playwriting class. As a result, what was supposed to be a one act play had turn into the movie that turned these struggling actors into instant A list celebrities. (Nanos) It is very unique that the writers are able to star in their own movie, which in my opinion helped them portray the story exactly the way they wanted it. They were both a double-threat, being both the actors and script writers. Damon and Affleck were childhood friends who grew up together as aspiring actors. Both from Cambridge, Massachusetts, they were able to at authentically portray their characters as well as the city of Boston. They were extremely familiar with the setting, they were trying to depict to the audience, being from Boston, which made this film so popular among Boston residents as well as people from across the country. (Nanos) Many of the local residents were cast as extras one noted, ""the clothing was right, the way they acted, the accents, the cars they drove.""(Good Will Hunting:Released) Everything was absolutely perfect. In addition, the two were real life best friends, making the on screen chemistry between that much better. As a result, Damon and Affleck were the ideal pair to star in this movie. Robin Williams also won an Oscar for the movie for best supporting role. In creating the latter character, the screenplay offers Robin Williams the rare serious role that takes full advantage of his talents (New york times). Williams' character Sean; helps develop Will, who is the most dynamic character in this story. Without the role of Williams, and the relationship between the two, we would not see Will grow and ultimately change into the new man he becomes at the end of the movie. The back and forth arguing between Will and Sean made them so entertaining, ""this film is bright and knowing enough to bring fresh energy to the jousting between Will and Sean McGuire, the fellow underachiever who proves to be the only therapist who can handle him""(new york times) A life long friendship was soon formed between the two who challenging each other every step of the way. ""The film strains slightly in creating a set of neatly parallel friendships and by finding too many echoes of Will's problems in Sean's own past. But what it does beautifully is to develop a doctor-patient sparring that becomes affecting and important to both parties""(new york times) They both wanted each other to do more which their lives, which resulted in how the movie was ended. Sean was able to ""put his cards back on the table"" with the help of Will, and because of Sean's advice to ""Do what's in your heart and you'll be fine""(Good Will Hunting, 1997) The passion and genuine care Sean has for Will was obvious, resulting in a connection from the audience, making them want the same things for Will as Sean did. The love story aspect of the film makes it a feel good movie, which makes the audience realize what is important in life. Even though some critics claim that the plot is predictable, the movie is ended in an ironic way that surprised me (new york times). Based on the Will I knew at the beginning, I would've never expected him to go after Skylar like he did. His transformation made me realize how love can be so important and almost the only thing someone needs in life to be happy. Based on Sean's touching speech about the love he had with his wife, ""you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone could level you with her eyes. Feeling like! God put an angel on earth just for you¬Öwho could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel and to have that love for her to be there forever""(Good Will Hunting, 1997). At the end of the film Will was finally able to realize that he found this love with Skylar. He drives all the way across the country to be with her, which represents how love is greater than anything else. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a touching, sentimental film, portraying life's common hardships that people deal with on a daily bases that allows the audience to connect with it. Good Will Hunting (Van Sant, 1997) opened my eyes to the meaning of love as well as what is important in life, leaving me completely satisfied after watching the movie. The feel good American drama, which unfolds as a love story, is definitely a classic that leaves me feeling the same emotions every time I watch it.",10
20 May 2005,My favorite movie ever!,"My favorite thing to look for in movies is the way the characters interact with each other. I think this film does an excellent job of exploring the intricacies of interpersonal relationships and what causes people to become the way that they are. I give this movie 2 thumbs up (if I had more thumbs, I would give them, too).

I learn something new about myself, about people, and about life in general every time I watch this movie. I know that most people are usually watch movies just for fun. But if you enjoy thought-provoking movies, movies that challenge and stimulate you intellectually, then this movie is for you. I think that we've all felt like Will at one point in our lives, and so then Will's journey (meaning the plot of the movie), in a way,remind us of our own journeys.

I can't even tell you how many times I've watched this movie. It never ceases to amaze me and teach me new things. And even though it's such a deep movie, there is so much humor mixed in that breaks the tension. I have a friend who is also very fond of this movie, and we are always quoting humorous lines to each other when we're joking around. We also quote some of the more serious lines from the movie when having discussions. There are just too many great things about this movie to describe!",10
31 July 2014,"An understated genius works alongside an eccentric counselor to heal from his troubled past and learn the ropes to life, love, and acceptance in this feel-good film.","Good Will Hunting (1997) directed by Gus Van Sant tells the story of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), an MIT janitor who displays a genius level IQ by solving a mathematic equation that stumps even Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd). Because of Will's rough background in a rough part of Boston includes a childhood plagued with abuse and causes him to have near-constant trouble with the law. After his genius is understood, Lambeau negotiates a deal to keep Will out of prison, given that he will attend court ordered counseling. Enter Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Lambeau's college roommate who is a psychology professor at a nearby community college. Through therapy sessions with Will, Sean and Will both begin to heal from the pain of their pasts, as well as discover a hope for the future. Sean helps Will to open up to the notion of love through the stories of his wife's hilarious and endearing ""idiosyncrasies."" In the opening scene, Will meets Skylar (Minnie Driver) who persists until the end to help Will see that he is worth loving and being loved.

The overall motif of Good Will Hunting is the idea of love and acceptance. Do we accept others enough to love them? Do we accept ourselves enough to allow others to love us? Do we accept our past in order to move on? Good Will Hunting is a classic coming of age tale that is excruciatingly relatable. The audience is enthralled with the poignant plot and the storyline is highlighted by the bare bones style of editing. Everything about this film feels very natural which is essential to the film feeling genuine rather than another Cinderella story clich√©. The lighting and sound are especially utilized because of the variance in setting. Will frequents a Harvard bar, Sean's office, as well as his own room. The sounds in each are very different: the loud chatter and bass music of the bar, the comfortable silences shared in Sean's office, and the buzz of incandescent lighting in Will's bedroom are all showcased. The lighting is also genuine to the settings being dimmer in the bar, almost sterile in the MIT scenes, and appropriately flickering in other scenes. Throughout the film, the audience follows the relationship between Sean and Will, as they both learn to accept themselves, each other, and their pasts.",9
13 July 2014,"The perfection of ""Good Will Hunting""","This movie was by far the best constructed movie i have ever watch in my 17 years. The story line is excellent makes this movie interesting for it's entirety. The actors are 100% molded inside their character which gives the viewer an emotional connection to their feelings. And finally the movie contains none other than my favourite actor of all time.... ROBIN WILLIAMS. His effectiveness as an actor to exploit all the realms of his emotion treasure chest books is unparallelled. I mean he goes from playing peter pan and the genie, to an old lady and a therapist. Absolutely incredible. I for one am not a huge fan for swearing is movies, yet this movies uses then to perfection and it elevates this movies pedigree even further. It also helps when you have Ben Affleck and Matt Damon is a movie as well. This movie discuss the hardship to find perfection in ones life and in doing so has transposed perfection before our very eyes.

28 September 2014,Good Will Hunting,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down.

17 October 2017,Best Movie I've Ever Seen By Far,"I will write this as simply as I can: This is the best movie ever directed, ever written, ever acted, ever edited, ever filmed. The casting was immaculate - from Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robyn Williams, to Stellan Skarsgard - and no other cast could have convinced me with such an in-depth and intense compilation of scenes how believable and miraculous script writing could be. Having saw this movie in the theatre when it was first released, it is STILL my most prized go-to movie and I can't even begin to relay some of the quotes that stick with me to this day. Such a diverse role for Robyn Williams and the accents they all mastered were flawless. I'll forever be quoting Ben Affleck in a baby-blue suit and reciting Williams' explanation of an infamous person by whom Skarsgard was baffled. A must see for anyone with any semblance of a greater mind.

18 July 2015,One of the greates movies of the 20th century,"Gus Van Sant brings a dramatic, emotional filled, inspiring, movie to theaters. We see familiar actors that we have seen in a lot of great movies. Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a janitor at M.I.T who has gift for mathematics but has a big record for crimes he as done. After many run-ins with the law there is only one person who can help him: a psychology professor ( Robin Williams) who may be able to turn his life around. This film was very emotional to me. It has a great plot and great script and many turning points throughout the movie. Van Sant used actors that were good to his taste and had many years of experience with acting and were great with their roles: Matt Damon's character was very dramatic and emotional throughout the movie and the hardships he faces. Robin Williams played his role really good that I felt it was just perfect as he explains to Will that deep down in him there is good inside while Ben Affleck and Minnie Drive were great too- both played good in their roles and probably liked Van Sant's way of directing. During a number of scenes it was sort of hard to follow what was happening but as I kept watching I understood how connected the characters were together and the strong chemistry they had. Overall the film is very creative, emotional, and dramatic and worth watching numerous times. This movie shows how deep down this is good in every person.",10
25 June 2016,Very good movie,"Ben Affleck and Matt Damon scenario and on camera and Gus Van Sant behind the camera to perhaps one of his most impersonal movies but particularly successful. It tells the story of Will, an orphan living in Boston, a genius of science, mathematics and physics in particular, but also rebels fleeing a painful and sad reality past. His meeting with psychologist will he seems to change his life. Gus Van Sant delivers a captivating film, sometimes dramatic and funny. It happens to capture various feelings and us interested and captivated to this story. The script is well written and quite original in ideas. The staging classical and impersonal enough is yet successful. Interpretations are really excellent, Robin Williams and Matt Damon in the lead. A very good film, entertaining, intelligent, moving and captivating.

26 March 2016,Wonderfully Powerful,"What a powerful film.

I always say that a great film, book, TV show, etc should have me reacting throughout: laughing when the characters laugh, feeling the need to cry when they cry, feeling loss when they experience loss, and so on. So by my definition, Good Will Hunting is a great film. It's so real and moving, but in such a wonderful way that isn't depressing or unbearably dark like so many films that deal with similar concepts.

I am just so impressed with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's writing skills, and at such a young age. Their ability to handle some of the serious subject matter that comes up in this movie is incredible, as is the creation of such well developed characters that interact in a beautifully natural way. You can feel the chemistry radiate from the screen, especially with the relationships between Matt Damon's character and his best friend (Ben Affleck), love interest (Minnie Driver), and ""therapist"" (the late Robin Williams).

Fantastic dialogue, fantastic story, fantastic characters, and even some fantastic scenery and visuals.

For all of these reasons, as well as many more detailed reasons which I am just a bit too tired to dive into right now, this movie has made my ""Everyone Needs To Watch At Least Once"" list.",10

29 August 2016,Beautiful film & flag bearer for the power of communication.,"A beautiful movie, and a powerful message about the power of communication to transform lives - especially young people's.

A great advert for therapy, which seems still misunderstood.

It's one of those movies which never seems to age.

A great tribute to Robin Williams, and his breadth as an actor.

His comic power is always underscored by his humanity.

Would recommend to people of all ages.

A classic without doubt, but perhaps needs re-introduced to a new generation.

As powerful as it ever was.",10
19 September 2016,A Deep And Meaningful Life Changing Movie And A Serious Work Of Art.,"Far too much I could say on this movie. It's opened up my eyes very widely and wondering... Life is built up on trust. The ability to trust other people and most importantly learn to trust yourself. Trust yourself that you will feed your mind. Expand and explore all different energy. Trust yourself to learn everything you need to know about life. Learning is everything. When we learn, like planting a seed, we grow.

This is story of some very fascinating characters.

Learning about how life molds you.

Teaching you to never doubt your ability to explore your learning.

VERY powerful performances and outstanding dialogue.

Theory's, thoughts and endless times throughout the film haven't left my mind since it finished.

This is a MUST SEE movie. Inspiring. Encouraging. Moving. Educational. The list is endless. CLASSIC. For sure.

7 December 2016,Be the Best You,"This is the type of film that makes you missing hanging out with your friends on a daily basis. The type of film that tells me that intelligence doesn't have to look, dress, or act a certain way to be respected. The character of Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a highly intelligent albeit troubled young man from Boston. He is staggeringly out of touch with the depths of both his potential and his problems. He is working as a janitor at MIT and solves and equation that Prof. Lambeau challenges his students to solve. In solving this equation and even more getting caught doing so, his genius is discovered. In order to foster this genius Prof. Lambeau leans on a former colleague of his, a psychologist. This psychologist is played Robin Williams and named Sean Maguire. Sean shows Will that struggle and love are a big part of life and he needs to embrace them both to move forward and upward. The theme of this movie can be summed up in human relationships. The many relationships that embellish boyishness and intellect collectively make this movie great. This reminds me of The Shawshank Redemption in the collective of human relationships both inside and out. Andy is troubled by his existence much like Will. The both culminate in a chrysalis type break through. The lighting of both movies is the same. Almost like they didn't do a day of filming without a cloudy sky. Human relationships are what make life worth living. In the end I was happy to see that Will ran toward his love, his existence.",8

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement.",8
19 July 2017,Brilliant,"Brilliant in all aspects of the film. Can not fault the portrayal of any character during the film. Each character leaves an impact with the viewer they will remember for a specific reason. The story line is complete and relatable and pertanant to the characters within the story line. I highly recommend this movie.

18 August 2017,A film that changed my life.,"I came here and saw as expected a host of reviews which praised this film to the heavens, as well as the odd few who seemed ignorant to the masterpiece they are watching. One said, ""nothing relatable at all"", and to that person and those who think this, I would advise that if one were to go through life avoiding the chance to understand things that don't apply to them, life shan't be very fulfilling at all. In a heartbroken place I have watched this movie for the first time. The gentleness and realness of the characters in this movie, the delicate yet powerful way in which those who created this masterpiece have portrayed the lives of the young and confused, the old and experienced (and yet still not done in their own confusion), is breathtaking. Many films are created for a reason, some to scare, some to inform, to be funny. This movie was written to have a personal relationship with all who watch it, to provide a strong wisdom to those who form a relationship with it. This is one of few movies that was written to change lives, and it has certainly changed my own. The use of profanity is, unlike many films, part of the realism of the movie. The lead character Will's contrasting intelligence and personality speaks to all of us and highlights the truth about the way we are when we are young, exaggerating them enough that we can see this in ourselves.

This film is beautiful, and it is simply not long enough. So many messages can be removed from every single line in this movie, and to everyone this movie will speak something unique but equally powerful if one chooses to embrace it. For a picture to speak such volumes that it can alter a persons life and perception of the life they have lived is a rare and incredible and probably unintentional feat. It is not for those who do not see deeply into the film to write negative reviews, but for those who feel the strength and love and passion of this film, who choose to feel this, to praise it, and hope that another can watch it, and feel this way too.",10
17 October 2017,Great Will Hunting,"Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

7 December 2005,Simply Genius Film,"Good Will Hunting is a beautiful and thoughtful film, which comprises the main aspects of brilliant film making. Director Gus Van Sant has taken the script and plot created by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and created a world in which the film seems real. The film is strikingly naturalistic, which blends well with the fact that Will Hunting is such a genius. The relationships that Will Hunting finds himself in throughout the film are portrayed in honest and fantastic ways, showing the diversity of the character and the way in which he interacts with the people trying to help him in his life.

His genius is undeniable, but his person is generally flawed. He is charming in the most unnaproachable way...his world is made up of loyalty to his close friends. It is a safe world that keeps his immense intelligence out of the limelight, he is just one of them.

Matt Damon is brilliant as Will Hunting, as he illustrates the emotions of the character so vividly, you feel as if you go on Will's journey with him. His ability to write co-write the script also writes volumes for his artistic intelligence. His performance is helped by the truly excellent Robin Williams, who gives a performance on a par with One Hour Photo, or Good Morning Vietnam. He is immensely believable, the park bench scene is one of the most raw and touching scenes in recent cinema, and the background of the character is identifiable and a constant source of interest.

The support of Minnie Driver is classy and fulfilling, as there blossoming relationship is so believable. And co-writer Ben Affleck is superb, in his only acting role of merit, as Will's best friend.

The Oscars were well deserved for this excellent and beautiful film, any argument that champions this as an American dream style film or a corny coming-of-age love story, has missed the point of the film. It is about potential, redemption, loyalty and love. Truly brilliant film.",10
4 February 2018,Great spin on the hidden genius premise.,"Matt Damon as Will and Ben Affleck as Chuckie fit into my visualization of the stereotypical young adult male from Boston in the 90's. The fact that the two were both raised in Massachusetts makes me smile a little when I realize they are most likely playing a version of themselves from the past but with that said I couldn't have enjoyed this movie more. I assumed far too much about this film just based on the quick synopsis I had read beforehand. Will being the problem child/genius was not quite what I was expecting. Typically these type of characters are written to be a sort of incredibly anti-social recluse, where as Will just received a really bad roll of the dice and grew up with little to no positive guidance and instead used his brilliance to skirt the law and impress his friends. The introduction of Robyn Williams' character, Sean, was the perfect addition to balance out Will's reckless nature. Sean's heartfelt approach to therapy is something that should be taken considered by real mental health professionals and Robin William's personality shines through perfectly as a foul-mouthed man that has experienced a world full of struggle and pain. A more exceptional match for a young Will has entered the building, the rest can go home. This film uses an impressive amount of close-up camera angles as a way to transition through dialogue which acts as a way to keep the viewer engaged and aware of the emotions on the characters faces. This fits perfectly with the emotional impact that Will and Sean's interactions have. What an amazing film, I will be watching this one a second time.",8
