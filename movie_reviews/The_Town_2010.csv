30 November 2013,Jeremy Renner intense,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.

21 July 2023,"Dark, Gloomy, Violent, Predictable","The Town initiates with a captivating plot, drawing viewers into yet another engaging heist genre movie. Embracing the trademark darkness of a DC film, the movie's overall tone remains consistently dark and gloomy, resonating with its violent and gritty setting.

The film manages to hold its audience's attention through strong performances. Ben Affleck delivers well as the protagonist, while Jeremy Renner shines with his exceptional portrayal, and Josh Hamm also impresses with a fine performance.

As the storyline unfolds, predictability arises, especially when a lady enters the picture, sparking conflicts and making life difficult for the protagonist and his best friend. While the film offered thrills through numerous conflicts, it mostly followed a predictable path.

There were some unmet expectations. The anticipation of heist scenes and adventurous chases went unfulfilled. I hoped to watch some good adventure, car chase and impeccable heist scenes, however, didn't get any. The focus remained fixed on the dark and gloomy town and the relationships between its characters.

In summary, The Town delivers a thrilling experience, buoyed by exceptional performances, yet leaving room for some disappointment. Although conflicts abound, they often follow predictable patterns.",6
19 September 2010,Affleck's second matches realism of the first and the fine ensemble carries the rest,"Ben Affleck's second feature film as a director -- if nothing else -- proves he's no fluke. In all the ways his sincere and revealing debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" succeeds, so does ""The Town."" Both are Boston-based crime dramas that are both touchingly dramatic at times yet gripping at others. More impressive with his work on ""The Town,"" however, is that it proves he could just as easily go on to direct an action blockbuster as he could an Oscar-winning drama.

It starts with the cast and the performances he gets from them. In 2007, he helped Amy Ryan to a supporting actress nomination, and that's ignoring the other talents in the film such as Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan and Ed Harris. In ""The Town,"" he gets Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner in his first major film since his breakout in ""The Hurt Locker"" and Jon Hamm in his first major film since TV's ""Mad Men"" took off. He also gets a pair of up-and-comers in Rebecca Hall and ""Gossip Girl"" star Blake Lively. And that's not to mention Pete Postelthwaite and Chris Cooper. Next to ""Inception,"" it's the best ensemble cast of the year.

Based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves,"" the film follows a team of bank robbers from Charlestown, an area notorious for grooming the best at intercepting armored cars and taking down banks. As with ""Gone Baby Gone,"" also based on a novel (by Dennis Lehane), the city of Boston and the people and culture are as important to Affleck as the plot. He's sure to let shots of the Charlestown bridge and Fenway Park soak in amidst the ever-building pinch the main characters are in.

Doug MacRay (Affleck) and his buddy Jim (Renner) and a couple others pull off a bank job in the opening scene, but when it doesn't go exactly as planned, they're forced to kidnap the bank manager (Hall). To make sure she didn't see anything and can hand them on a platter to the feds (led by Jon Hamm's Special Agent Frawley), Doug trails her, only to find himself falling for her.

""The Town"" is one of those crime dramas/bank-job action films that while not revelatory for the genre, executes everything well and sticks to a character-driven story in order to stay meaningful. Perhaps the reason it works so well is because it floats in between the drama, never becoming too much of a guns 'n robbers flick, but also not slipping into crime melodrama for too long. Affleck's performance as MacRay acts in accordance; it's tastefully understated and he lets go of the machismo that has marred a few of his previous roles.

The film also has an unexpected but much appreciated sense of humor. In a mile-a-minute crime drama/thriller, you don't expect to laugh the way you will in ""The Town,"" which speaks even more to the writing and Affleck's versatility. Even if there are some plot conventions and no-surprise characters (as good as Hamm is, he's playing every other quick-witted FBI guy in films), the dialogue is sharp, the story is exciting and the way we are so easily able to see things from MacRay's perspective as the bank robber who wants out makes up for any use of convention as a crutch.

There's no doubt that if ""The Town"" becomes a success that studios will seek out Affleck for some more high-profile projects and it will certainly be interesting to see how he handles material not rooted in Boston sub-culture. As long as he continues to get such memorable performances out of his actors, he'll be doing things on the other end of the camera for a long time to come.

20 January 2011,Great performances all-round and directing make this well worth watching,"Despite not having seen Gone Baby Gone, I've heard a lot of good things about Ben Affleck's switch to directing and so I decided to watch The Town, which put simply is about band robbers but to expand on that, the film is also about the leader of the group, played by Ben Affleck.

When watching the trailer it easy to draw comparisons to Heat and The Departed but this is different. Many films about crime make the audience side either the police or the criminals yet The Town allows the audience to see people from both sides of the law fairly. Jon Hamm plays an honest working FBI officer while Ben Affleck plays the criminal. The film is shot predominately from the criminals perspective, therefore the audience feel the same sense of urgency that they do but we don't want to see them gun down the FBI and police and let them get away with their crimes. It is a difficult challenge for the director to deal with but he does it well and the end result is very good.

The entire cast are all fantastic even when given smaller roles, for example Chris Cooper and the late Pete Postlethwaite steel the scenes that they are in. Jeremy Renner has earned a lot of attention from his role and he deserves it, giving an honest performance, which clearly took a lot of research to perfect. An almost unrecognisable Blake Lively and Rebecca Hall are both great. Ben Affleck and Jon Hamm as the opposing forces are also great but it is Renner's performance that stands out.

As a crime film, it is important that the action doesn't turn the whole film into an all guns blazing film. The action scenes are handed pretty well and the car chases through the minor roads of Boston are really exciting to watch.

The Town is not only only a solid action/ crime film but also marks Affleck as a great director. I strongly recommend this film if you are interested in the genre. While it is not perfect, it does so much well, that you would be missing out if you didn't see this.",8
17 September 2010,One of the finest pieces of ensemble acting in years,"To say that The Town is everything Takers tried to be and failed at would actually be an insult to Ben Affleck's latest film. Mentioning that bland rehashing in the same breath would imply they even exist on the same plane, but the honest truth is this gritty Boston crime drama is something special and the best film of the early fall season.

Affleck's first foray into directing with the Dennis Lehane adaptation Gone Baby Gone shocked viewers and the critical community in kind, showing that a fading acting career does not mean one is down-and-out in Hollywood. Affleck marries his two passions in The Town, directing, producing and writing the film as well as starring in the lead role, his first since 2003's Paycheck. He owns this comeback performance, successfully wiping any lingering distaste from duds like Daredevil or Gigli. This is by no means a one-man show, but The Town has nothing close to a weak link, in fact, this may be one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting in years.

Joining Affleck in a supporting role is Jeremy Renner, fresh off his best actor Oscar nomination for The Hurt Locker and he beyond a doubt proves he is no one-hit wonder. This is Oscar-worthy acting yet again for Renner, nailing his Boston accent along with his loose-cannon mentality. He is terrifying, but impossible to pry your eyes away from. The most shocking revelation comes from Blake Lively (TV's ""Gossip Girl"") as a doped-up mother with more than a few issues. She is not only unrecognizable, but owns her role, never calling attention to her drastic deviation from type. Substantial buzz was also placed in the way of John Hamm from the acclaimed television drama Mad Men. He is sufficiently pompous as a dedicated FBI agent also scoring a number of the films laughs.

Before I wander too much further into specifics, the characters in The Town populate a Boston suburb called Charlestown, which an introductory message informs us, is the world-center for bank robbers. Affleck's Doug MacRay heads a team of those in such a profession including Renner as James Coughlin and two others played by Slaine, and Owen Burke. During one of their routine bank heists, they are forced to take a hostage (Rebecca Hall) during their hasty escape. Afterwards, to make sure she does not know anything incriminating following her release from captivity, MacRay follows her and inadvertently falls for her in the process.

There is nothing particularly revelatory about The Town, there are few surprises or much that deviates from a standard crime drama. But Affleck directs with such skill and confidence while showcasing yet another peek into suburban Boston that it is never less than riveting. There is an overlying sense of impeding dread that perforates The Town and a handful of sensational action sequences do little to let up the firm grasp the film has on our windpipes. Propelled by faultless acting and a pitch- perfect script, this slice of the Boston criminal underworld is everything for which we could have hoped following such a bland summer. Affleck has always been a star, and if he continues to produce films of this pedigree, then there might be hope for the movies yet.",8
18 September 2010,Ben Affleck has his comeback.,"A bank robbery goes a little different than planned when one of the robbers takes a hostage. Doug (Affleck) has to duty to check up on the hostage after she is let go, to see if she knows anything about the crew. Surprise, they start dating. Can he continue his life of robbing banks and have a love life? Will his crew accept that he is with her? Will she ever find out? This is The Town.

Gone Baby Gone was his first directorial effort set in the city of Boston, The Town is his second. Ben obviously loves the city and if he keeps making films like these two, I'll be happy with some more Boston. I'm not going to preach about which film is better, their both different. Gone Baby Gone has more of an emotional punch with it's climax and tough decisions. The Town doesn't reach those heights, but it's a well made tense action thriller with a bit of a romance thrown in.

This time Affleck is in front of the camera as well. He seems to have left his pretty boy blockbuster image behind him. I'm thankful, I can only take so many Armageddons or Pearl Harbors. He's matured as an actor, this is evident by his roles as of late. State of Play and Hollywoodland are two examples. Of course he's had some fun films in between, but he's probably the best thing about those. Extract anyone?

For The Town he has assembled quite the cast. Jeremy Renner, who is hot off of The Hurt Locker plays his buddy with an attitude who won't think twice about pulling the trigger if you're in his way. Mad Men's Jon Hamm who is the FBI agent on their trail, his partner is Man in Black actor Titus Welliver, who was also in Gone Baby Gone. I wouldn't mind seeing more of him in films and if he's Affleck's good luck charm, all the better. Blake Lively has a small role and she does skanky a little too well. She has a thing for Affleck's character and she has a daughter, but he's obviously fallen for someone else. Rebecca Hall, who has the hard role of playing the woman who is dating her abductor. Things don't look too well for this relationship.

The Town shows Affleck's ability at directing action sequences. Gone Baby Gone wasn't full of gunfights and car chases, but The Town is. There are three separate heists in the film, the opening, the middle section and the climactic ending. All three are different from each other, one is in a bank, the other a truck and finally a baseball stadium. Each heist was exciting to watch and gave you those Heat moments. It's obviously the Heat was influential in the making of this film. It seems all movies that have robberies in them look to Heat.

Ben Affleck had a hand in writing the film, he of course won an Oscar with Matt Damon for writing Good Will Hunting. It appears he's found his footing once again and hopefully the allure of the blockbuster won't claim him once more. The Town is a successful film made for adults. It's slick, well acted and has enough thrilling moments to keep those who seek it entertained. The film centres mostly on Affleck and his new love and the heist bits are second fodder. Renner is the only one who gets some spotlight from the crew, the other two are simply background faces. The Town does it's job as a movie and Ben Affleck has found himself a new career.",8
14 September 2010,Take a bow Mr. Affleck....you have certainly earned it.,"My Oh My how Ben Affleck has had a up and down career. Starting out as the cheesy yet funny guy in those Kevin Smith flicks, to the academy award winning writer of ""Good Will Hunting"", all the way back down to the pathetic string of acting he produced only 10 years ago. But there is a silver lining....with his directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone"", and his much improved acting in ""Hollywoodland"". Ben Affleck is beginning to once again prove his worth in Tinsel Town. Hopefully he can continue to feverish pace.

Well i can say with complete just, that this is the best ""Heist"" movie since ""Swordfish""......Now i know most of you may not like ""Swordfish"", but what other bank robbery movie can you compare it to in the past 10 years? Maybe ""Snatch""? ""Lock Stock""?....eh, if you classify those movies as ""Heist"" pictures, than okay, it's the best heist movie since ""Snatch"" or maybe even ""Oceans 11""....either way, it's a big compliment.

Ben Affleck has certainly proved that ""Gone Baby Gone"" was not a fluke. He can actually direct a major motion picture. And not only can he do it, he does it very well. Sure the movie had some minor flaws, but nothing that takes too much away from the overall big picture. The best way i can compare it is.....it's like an east coast ""Heat"". Now, the group is not as fool proof or professional as the gang in ""Heat""......well, let's face it, you will probably never top that group in movie.....ever. But never the less, the style of film making really pulls you into each sequence, whether it be the action packed bank robbery, the emotional dialog between characters, or the intense decisions the players all must endure.

The movie doesn't try to WOW! you by offering a different style of bank robbery. Which is a good thing, because you really run the risk of tripping over your own two feet in the process. But i really think the major factor in this film, was the acting. Everyone came to play ball in this one........but i can also say this with complete confidence.......Ben Affleck was the best actor in this movie. Yes, i know it's hard to swallow for some of you, but he really showed us all, what he is truly capable of doing. So Mr. Affleck, let me tip my hat to you and say job well done sir. You took a lot of crap to the face, and you wiped it off, and came back strong.

Bottom Line......Yes, i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies of the year so far. Sure the movie gets a little sappy at the end, but it's pretty necessary. But overall, your very well entertained.

I read an article a few months ago about even after ""Gone Baby Gone"", people still wouldn't hire Affleck as a director. And he had to fight tooth and nail to land this deal. Well, hopefully now you can find more work buddy, because you have certainly earned it.",8
1 May 2012,"""Welcome to bank robbery capital of America""","The Town... The movie is good, no doubt about it. It was well-acted, well-written, and all around just a fantastic movie. Problem is, albeit the fantastic directing, it's contrived. I say that with a sense of greatness though, because although being this, is actually does it in a good way. Ben Affleck - yeah, the actor! - directs, and deserves praise. Why? Well he actually made a good movie, simple and to the point. But instead of going on and on about how good (but formulaic) the film is, I'm just going to break down the good things, and why Ben Affleck needs to direct more movies.

Story: It's just easy to follow. The story was simple and easy to follow, and Ben Affleck knows this. So he DOES this. Movies nowadays think the key to making and film (and winning over the critics) is to create all these absurd quick edits and complex back flashes to what, when, and where something happened, then quickly cut to a twist, back again. It's confusing. No one really wants that. So instead of doing this, he creates a story that's easy and simple to follow. That's exactly what I wanted.

Acting: Ben Affleck directs and stars. He did a great job on both parts, and he sets up the cast perfectly. First off, there's no cringe-worthy scenes. We are following the characters throughout, and there isn't no crazy stuff the characters do or say that we question. A lot of movies do that, The Town knows exactly what not to do. It was real too, leading me too...

Realism: Yup. The Town knows how to create this effect? How does it create this effect? Well I'll tell you! The Town knows not to put in cheesy CGI effects. Everything lots realistic and gritty. You feel like your sucked into the situation of the characters. That's what films are SUPPOSED to do, and the objection is not to make us entertained. Movies are supposed to be an experience, and The Town knew what to do.

Romance: I cannot believe I am putting this on here, but it counts. The Town isn't confused with just being a crime-thriller. It knows it's strengths and it's weaknesses. It's a genre-binder. It binds together what we want to watch, too. Action, drama, romance, and more drama. What more could you exactly want? The movie has it all.

If you can get past that the movie is a bit contrived, it knows how to push this thing out of the way. It's simplistic, gritty, and highly realistic. Yup, this is a Ben Affleck movie and I'm proud to say it. The movie was fantastic though, and if wasn't so clichéd in some parts, maybe it would become a masterpiece. But it did what it did, as pushed boundaries no movie has dared to do. So that sets it, go see it. Recommended for all. 8/10.",8
18 September 2010,I'll see you again...,"I was wrong about Ben Affleck. I never believed that Affleck was ever a star. I never saw him as a director-type. I do admit I was wrong, though. Ben Affleck was truly incredible as Doug McCray, and I've never seen him work his acting at such a high level. As far as the plot of the film goes, it's very engaging. The trailer doesn't give this film justice as it's very intense and romantic at times.

Jeremy Renner is quite intimidating and Blake Lively is sexy, Ben Affleck is gripping and the supporting cast is incredibly powerful. I think the movie was powerful and not at all predictable. I couldn't wait to see what would happen and if Doug would get away. It's such a greatly crafted movie. From writing to acting this film is wickedly astounding.

I thought that the sex scene was over too quickly, but it was made up with all the action. I thoroughly enjoyed the chase scenes. I thought the action sequences were well-drawn out. I loved the bank robbery scenes of the blue masks and the nun outfits. I especially liked Ben's scenes with the sledge hammer and the scene where he says, ""if I think anything might happen to her, I'm gonna kill both of you."" It's a clip from the trailer, but it's so much better when it happens in the film.

It's driven as an action film with drama and romance on the side. There's a few chuckles along the way, but pretty much sparse. I thought the romance was done just enough and I felt the drama was perfectly done and drastically added to the plot, as well as the tone of the film.

It's certainly the best heist movie I've ever seen. In comparison, if you called Inception a heist movie, this movie is a better heist movie. I really think this is the Heat of the decade. I truly believe that Affleck is in his peek of his career and this is his greatest performance, directing, writing and acting. I'm overjoyed and excited to see his next piece of work.",9
17 November 2011,"Smart and taut, with some fine ensemble acting","The Town was one of my most anticipated movies and while it wasn't quite as great as I thought it would be it was still very good with some outstanding areas. The sex scene I agree was over too soon and needed a more rounded finish, and the film does get sappy and draggy toward the end.

In a sense too, The Town is not much new in concept, but the way everything is written and delivered I found this easy to forget. It is a slick and stylishly made movie, complete with some smart scripting that made me chuckle at times as well as on the edge of my seat, confident direction and a taut and suspenseful story.

For me, The Town also contains some of the best ensemble acting of 2010. Ben Affleck is surprisingly subtle, and Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively manage to be cute and sexy without their performances being overly reliant on these factors. John Hamm, Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite also give fine work, but it was Jeremy Renner's brooding intensity that captivated here.

All in all, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8
29 October 2010,The Town is a generic crime-thriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",6
10 November 2015,Not as original as you'd think,"I'd heard plenty about THE TOWN, a film which lifted Ben Affleck from the doldrums and gave him a revamped career of sorts by revealing him to be an efficient director of modern-day thrillers. One reviewer on here even likens him to Scorsese. So what of this Oscar-nominated film, and will it really stand up to scrutiny? The answer is no, not really. THE TOWN turns out to be a very familiar and ordinary type of thriller that comes across as a Boston-set rip-off of Michael Mann's HEAT. Once again we follow the predictable story of a gang of bank robbers, with the running time split between their lives and loves and the actual heist scenes.

Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike this film. I particularly enjoyed Affleck's direction in the action scenes, which are vibrant, gritty, and exciting (even if the whole clichéd blue tint look of the cinematography spoils things a bit). There's a top-notch car chase and some quite wonderfully hard-hitting scenes at the (again, predictable) climax. It's the stuff in between the action where this film falls down.

To put it bluntly, THE TOWN is overlong and features characters who aren't particularly interesting. The likes of Affleck and Jeremy Renner are defined by their actions, so watching them sitting around chatting is pretty dull. The romantic scenes are even worse, even if Rebecca Hall does a good job. And the whole sub-plot with Jon Hamm's FBI guy is unnecessary, feeling tacked on and dragging the pace down still further. THE TOWN is a fun thriller, but nothing special.",6

20 March 2012,Definitely Watch the Director's Cut,"I just wanted to say that on its own, the theatrical cut is a pretty damn awesome movie. Watching the extended cut is 10X even better. Simply put you get to see even more of the fascinating characters. Jon Hamm, while definitely playing the asshole, does quite nicely Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively are pretty awesome, the two creating a nice foil. And Peter Postlethwaite, rest his soul, is awesome in it. Jeremy Renner will go down in history as one of cinema's greatest bad-asses, that's for sure. And Ben Affleck, what can be said of Affleck? He not only starred in this, but co-wrote the screenplay and directed it. An aspiring Clint Eastwood figure? While films such as this are a great start, he has a long way to go before creating such a legacy, and he I hope he continues to make more great movies.

Regardless, this crime thriller is definitely a masterpiece. Its heart-pounding action is backed up with an excellent plot and bold characters. Credit is also due to the original source material, Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"" (the author who has gone onto write the Strain trilogy with Guillermo del Toro). The score was also pretty great, by Harry Gregson-Willaims and David Buckley.

Sure to become a classic.",10
9 June 2012,Let's go downtown...,"I remember laughing out loud at the aberration of a movie that was ""Pearl Harbour"" and in particular Ben Affleck's ""Kinda, sorta, coulda..."" chat-up line and haven't even seen ""Gigli"", but it's fair to say that with this and his earlier effort ""Gone Baby Gone"" he's certainly found his métier, not only in front, but also behind the camera.

""The Town"" (a poor title for a fast-moving film like this) is a gritty, contemporary heist thriller, with believable characters in largely realistic situations and with credible motives for their actions. I say largely, because you do have to get over the improbability of Affleck's serial armed robber's affair with accidental hostage Rebecca Hall and a series of thrilling but unbelievable car-chases and shoot-outs.

That said, the latter are delivered with skill and precision, while the attempts at character development are rewarded by the depth they add to the plot line. The acting too is of a high standard, with, to be honest, most of the supporting participants outshining the headline names of Affleck, Hall and ""Mad Men's"" Jon Hamm, in particular Jeremy Renner as Affleck's trigger-happy right-hand man and the late Pete Postlethwaite as the ruthless Irish overseer of the gang's criminal operations.

I visited Boston once over 15 years ago whch included taking in a baseball match at the venerable Fenway Park venue and enjoyed seeing this and other locations again, but better yet was just to chance to watch that rarity, a gripping and involving contemporary crime thriller, which this certainly was.",8
2 January 2016,Ben Affleck's directorial efforts pay off,"Ben Affleck makes his second directorial effort after his debut in 'Gone Baby Gone' in this modern crime-drama set in the Charleston neighborhoods of Boston. Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a long-time bank robber who leads a group of criminals including his half-brother Jem Couglin (played by Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (played by Slaine), and Desmond Elden (played by Owen Burke), in a bank heist where Doug crosses paths with the bank manager Claire Keesey (played by Rebecca Hall) who witnesses the beating of her boss. Months later, their bank robbing spree comes to pause, and Doug comes face- to-face with Claire who doesn't recognize him from the robbery at a laundry shop. The two begin bonding eventually form a relationship, with Doug trying to keep his bank robbing spree a secret from Claire. The situation gets progressively dangerous when FBI agent Adam Frawley (played by Jon Hamm) and his crew set out in pursuit to take Doug and his crew down.

Ben Affleck has been one of the most talented actors of this genre, and this film shows he is only gifted in acting, but also in directing and writing. Opening with the four main characters armed, and dressed in black suits and ghoul masks busting through the bank and wielding their guns at the employees; this movie gives a fascinating and realistic depiction of the lives of bank robbing criminals, and the consequences that ensue. The story evenly balances a romantic subplot between Ben Affleck's character and Rebecca Hall's character, and the main character and his group running a life of vicious crime. The storyline is written very sharply and rarely suffers from inconsistencies. The romance between Affleck and Hall is handled very maturely by not poisoning the characters with overly sappy dialogue and instead, giving the characters a believable touch while connecting to the main story. As this is a crime-based flick, there are some scenes that get a bit violent and at times, quite brutal; though not as harsh as what you would see a Martin Scorsese film. However, they effectively show the brash nature of the characters.

Ben Affleck gives a really decent and grounded performance as the main character, though not as impressive as Jeremy Renner who delivers some outstanding acting as his half-brother. Although it wasn't quite expecting him to garner an Oscar nomination, I am being honest to say is quite impressive. Rebecca Hall also delivers a performance that deserves credibility. These actors are truly amazing and their characters feel so authentic thanks to their performance and Affleck's top notch screenplay.

The Town is not likely go down as a classic and doesn't level up to the critically acclaimed crime flicks like 'Goodfellas' or 'The Departed'. Nonetheless, it is a very entertaining and solid addition to the crime genre. Ben Affleck does a great job in terms of acting, directing, and writing.",8
23 April 2011,The Code of Silence and Friendship in Charlestown,"After the heist of the Cambridge Merchants Bank, the four thieves blindfold and kidnap the manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). They take her driver license; release her at an empty beach; and head to Charlestown, Boston. Later, the friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) find that Claire also lives in Charlestown and they decide to monitor her steps. Doug MacRay gets close to Claire to know what she might have told to the FBI and they fall in love with each other.

Meanwhile, the FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is assigned to investigate the heists to armored trucks and banks in Charlestown and he concludes that the thieves are the four friends. He joins his team and keeps Doug and his friends under surveillance. Doug decides to move to Florida with Claire and begin a new life; however, the dwellers are trapped in Charlestown and they do not have any way out but dead.

""The Town"" is an engaging and surprisingly great thriller directed by Ben Affleck. The story of dwellers that live under a code of silence and friendship in a town called Charlestown develops the lead characters very well and is a combination of thriller, crime, drama and action genres. The beauty of Rebecca Hall is very impressive and she has a great chemistry with Ben Affleck. This is the next to last film of Pete Postlethwaite, who died of cancer in the beginning of this year. My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil): ""Atração Perigosa"" (""Dangerous Attraction"")",8
16 February 2011,That Tug at Personal Morality,"I always get caught short on the idea of the glorification of someone whose life revolves around the deaths of others, whose ""occupation"" is to steal from those who have no say in anything. What I mean is, our hero is not there to dole out justice or to even a score, he's a two bit punk who happens to be smoother and more handsome than the others around him. In the process, he begins to become more human because of falling into a relationship. I know that this attitude would negate ""The Godfather"" or any of the wise-guy movies so popular over time. So I enjoy the development of the characters, even if I have not one scintilla of admiration for them. The ugliness of the Boston streets works well here as does the criminal element and the ""honor among thieves"" thing. What works well is Affleck's brush with true humanity. One last issue. I'm getting a little tired of the incredible amount of fire-power that these guys have and how little carnage there really is. Also, there seems to be a lot of carelessness in police work if we are to believe this stuff.

12 February 2011,Robbing A Shrine,"In The Town Ben Affleck got to do another big screen tribute to his home town of Boston and even better got to shoot a good deal of this film at his beloved Fenway Park. Directing, writing, and starring in The Town who could ask for more except to shoot the film in places that I'm sure meant a good deal to him personally.

But The Town isn't some hazy nostalgic type movie, not by any means. It's a hard hitting crime drama about the lives of a heist crew and what it took for the FBI to bring them down.

The Town is brutally realistic in its depiction of these robbers who grew up in the tough neighborhood of Charlestown where people enter the trade of thievery from generation to generation. Ben Affleck is such a person whose father Chris Cooper is currently doing a life sentence for a robbery that was planned by neighborhood crime boss Pete Postlethewaite from his florist shop. Pete's character must have been steeped in crime lore and took as his model that other noted florist of Irish descent who also ran a crime organization, Dion O'Bannion.

At their latest robbery where the crew is completely masked, a hostage they took and released after safely getting away was seen talking to the FBI in the person of agent Jon Hamm who has made it his life's crusade to take this bunch down. They took her driver's license and note that Rebecca Hall is from The Town. Just to make sure she isn't telling anything that could lead to their arrest, Affleck arranges an accidental meeting with Hall. Even though he's already involved with Blake Lively sister of friend Jeremy Renner and fellow crew member, Affleck and Hall start getting involved to the surprise of Affleck.

The Town as elements of classic films like White Heat and The Asphalt Jungle and what I like about it is like The Asphalt Jungle, director Affleck got some well rounded, three dimensional portraits of his characters without sacrificing either suspense or action. Jeremy Renner who is up for Best Supporting Actor is great as the best friend and fellow crew member who is determined not to go back to prison for life as he's already a two time loser. Postlethwaite is as lethal as Dion O'Bannion was and in his own scene with Affleck visiting him in prison Chris Cooper is unforgettable. Cooper is one of the best actors we have currently, I've never seen him bad in anything he does and The Town is no exception.

The climax involved the gang pulling a heist on that noted Boston shrine Fenway Park. That's almost sacrilege in Boston, but this is one nervy crew of professionals. And the FBI is not stupid either. The climax should satisfy any action fan.

I really recommend seeing The Town which is a film that succeeds on numerous levels and can be enjoyed by all kinds of film fans with all kinds of taste.",8
25 January 2011,"""The Town"" proves that Ben Affleck is not only a gifted actor, but also has a great eye for directing.","In ""The Town,"" Ben Affleck plays Doug, the brains behind an Irish mob that robs banks and plans heists all around the Boston area. After their last huge bank job, Doug learns from his colleague, James (James Coughlin), that the female bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall) from the bank lives a few blocks away from where the mob meets. This is when Doug decides to investigate Claire and see what she knows about him and the other members of his crew. Along the way, Doug falls in love with Claire as the FBI is slowly investigating him and his fellow mob members to see where they are going to strike next. It's only a matter of time before the FBI comes after Doug and it's now up to Doug to decide whether it's the mob life or love....

I have to admit when I first saw the trailers for ""The Town"" I wasn't really that impressed with it. Sure it looked like a solid action movie about bank-robbers but the trailers just seemed to give away too much. When ""The Town"" was actually released in theaters I didn't have a chance to see it because it was released during a time where for some reason, which I am not sure of, I didn't see any films. I did however, read the reviews for the film and they were nothing but extreme positives. I tried to see the film in theaters but like most things nowadays it didn't last more than a few weeks at the local theaters. I decided to buy the flick on Blu Ray and finally sat down last night to watch it...

There is so much good to say about ""The Town"" but it's hard to pick where to start. The easiest place to start is with Ben Affleck so I am going to start there. As many may know already, Affleck directed, co-wrote, and starred in this film. Unlike most people, I never really disliked Affleck even though earlier in his career, he had a few stinkers (""Gigli,"" ""Daredevil,"" and ""Jersey Girl"" all come to mind) but I figured he just hasn't found the right fit yet. In ""The Town"" Ben Affleck shows off just how solid of an actor he can be with the right material. He plays the tough Irish mob leader to perfection. I am talking everything from the accent to the mannerisms; Affleck just nails it.

Along with the acting, his eye as a director is also rather solid. This is Affleck's second directorial endeavor and its surprisingly better than his first, which is saying a lot. ""Gone Baby Gone"" was well reviewed by critics and audience members alike and many were shocked to learn that Affleck directed that flick. ""The Town"" is rated even higher by both categories of people. Affleck knows his way behind the scenes capturing raw emotion, realistic and gritty violence, and truly showing his audience he knows how to make his cast act out their roles to near perfection. Affleck's dark and corrupt vision of Boston reminded me of something Martin Scorsese would have created. If Affleck keeps this up, you never know but he might just become the next Scorsese.

Besides Affleck providing a solid performance, there are several other names that deserve some recognition here. Rebecca Hall is absolutely terrific as the bank manager and Doug's love interest. It's was interesting to see a smaller name in such a big role but it worked to the films advantage. She seemed perfect to play an out of town girl, who gets involved with someone has sleazy and shady as Doug. Jon Hamm did a perfect job as the lead FBI agent. I haven't seen him in many other projects but his mannerisms fit my ideal image of a FBI agent. Jeremy Renner, who played James was just nuts! He played this whacked out character perfectly. The guy seemed to not care about anything and anyone but did it in such a believable fashion. He truly was a demented and troubled soul in the film and really acted his heart out to show that. The one person I do have to say didn't really wow me was Blake Lively. I will admit it was nice seeing her play a really dark and gritty role, which is out of her normal character but she wasn't convincing to me. I just had a hard time believing her as a trashy person. As a whore, I can see but the white trash thing didn't work for me. I am sure many would disagree but trashy I couldn't picture.

All in all, I really don't have anything bad to say about ""The Town."" It was a solid film all around. The pacing was perfect, the acting was solid, and the direction was superb. This movie may soon be placed in the same category where such movies like ""Goodfellas,"" ""Casino,"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" now sit. It will not shock me if this film holds up over the years and becomes known as a cult classic. The film may be too violent or gritty for some but for those who like raw and gritty dramas will probably be adding ""The Town"" to their favorites list.

MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Town"" is a solid 8 out of 10. A ton of kudos points are in order for Affleck and the entire cast of this film.",8

27 March 2011,"You know people get up everyday, tell themselves something's gonna change their lives.","The Town is Charlestown, Boston, a place where crime is a way of life. Following a bank robbery, professional thief Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) has to keep a watch on bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) because after using her as hostage leverage during escape from the heist, she is the only witness who could possibly identify his gang. But once the two meet they start to fall for each other, forcing MacRay to re-evaluate his life in Charlestown. It's a re-evaluation that will upset a lot of people close to him and the gangster boss who hires him, and all this at a time when FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is closing in on the gang.

One of the most startling things about Ben Affleck's second film as director is that even with the conventional plot, and the formulaic characters, it's still an exhilarating and fresh picture. With Affleck comfortable in his Boston surroundings, it's evident that he and the team went for authenticity, something which in the main they achieve. Sure there's the odd implausible moments, they are - like it or not - cops and robbers staples, but ""The Town"" is not your standard run of the mill actioner. It is, for want of pigeon holing, a modern day noir, resplendent with bleak mood and well oiled characters. Based on Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"", pic follows the formula of a rotten town with rotten people doing their best or worst to live and get by. Into the pot comes the bad guy who meets a good woman who wants to leave his crappy life and crappy home behind. So far so well trodden path, then, but this is not a giant gangland operation, like, say, ""The Departed"" or ""The Godfather"" et al, this is a small neighbourhood setting, with a small group of everyday dressed young men. It's one of the reasons why Affleck's film feels so very authentic.

Helping to exude the naturalistic and human feel of the drama is that Affleck doesn't overdo his action sections, yet they are terrific sections for sure. This is not Tony Scott/Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer action for popcorn excess. From the electric kick-start of the first heist, to the mid-section car chase - and to the knock out coup de grâce set in motion at Red Sox Stadium - Affleck shows great skill as a crafter of action - aided superbly by Dylan Tichenor's energised editing. Other violence is swift and to the point, the director knowing not to dwell too long on vicious passages in the narrative, thus keeping his characters free of caricatures. Mind, he is thankful to the great cast assembled for his picture, for this is very much an actors piece. Well written without flabby periods of talk for talk sake, The Town provides proper drama for proper actors - and that includes the director himself.

Jeremy Renner is quickly turning into the go to guy for edginess, here as MacRay's best pal, Jem, he deals out a frightening loose cannon turn. Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite have small roles, but both impact hard on proceedings, both memorable and both adding a touch of classy know how. Hamm arguably has the hardest role, for as FBI Agent Frawley he has to carry on his own the other plot thread that is the investigation. Not just that, but the film lends itself to one which dares you to root for the bad guys, it's a tough ask of the ""Mad Men"" actor but he nails it, with one two-fold scene in a bar, as he grills MacRay's ex, Krista (Blake Lively heartfelt and believable), particularly offering a glimpse of what a good actor he can be. Ultimately the main load has to be carried by Affleck and Hall as the central doomed lovers. There is death and misery every where in Charlestown - and for the protagonists of the story, including Doug & Claire. Their relationship offers hope, a beacon of hope in a murky world, but it's a relationship founded on black secrets and built around falsehoods. That Affleck & Hall draw us in with charm and acting gravitas further serves notice as to why The Town is top draw stuff.

Hardships, hard decisions and hard characters come alive in The Town, a great modern day drama that's showing ""Gone Baby Gone"" was no fluke, this lad Affleck really is some director. 9/10",9
3 March 2011,Scandalous that this wasn't nominated for Best Film,"Sometime you have to wonder what the Academy are thinking when they announce the nominations for the Oscars. It's annoying when extremely average films like The Social Network and Winters Bone get nominated for best film yet the likes of The Town gets ignored. Ben Affleck has flattered to deceive in recent years with his directing and acting but i believe in future years , this film , will be seen as one of his greatest achievements. The Town is a good old fashioned Heist/Bank Robbery movie that is multi layered to the extent that you cant tank your eyes off the action. It takes me back to films like "" The French Connection"" , High adrenaline action films that rely on absolutely no CGI but great action and top notch acting. Having said that wasn't convinced by the performance of Jon Hamm who seemed to be clean shaven one minute yet growing a beard in the next. I watched the two and a half hour extended version and it still didn't drag. The Town is the the film that the 2010 Oscars forgot.

A pretty good, unique and interesting concept, but unfortunately manuscript and acting is pretty bad.

Extremely mediocre and cliche.

I think it is a pretty clever story that unfortunately fails to keep the viewer's attention's. A pretty boring films at some points. It has its thrilling moments though as the story develops and gets better and better.

Filming is also a bit bad.

Rather a exaggerated thriller and its a bit too long aswell.

19 September 2010,Monster of Green,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ben Affleck proved himself to be a talented director with ""Gone Baby Gone"". Here, he once again shows he is best suited behind the camera. He has a real feel for setting, scenery, actors and camera angles. Unfortunately, this story based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves"" is just a bit too formulaic to stand out from the crowd.

We are told upfront that the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown has more bank robbers than any other ... in fact, in some families it is a proud tradition, passed on to the next generation. Ben Affleck got the guide book from his dad - an incarcerated Chris Cooper who has only one scene, though it's very dramatic. Affleck's lifelong pal and crime partner is played by Jeremy Renner. Renner's character, Jem, is downright psychotic to Affleck's Mr. Sensitive. If after ""Hurt Locker"" you have a difficult time imagining Renner as a bad guy, you should check out ""North Country"". That's a very bad man.

As seen in the preview, Affleck's merry band of bank robbers take a hostage played by Rebecca Hall (""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""). Affleck, in the course of duty, falls for Hall. She is the light that shows him the way to a better life. Unfortunately, that story line leads us right back to more crime ... with FBI mad man Jon Hamm hot on the heals of the local bad boys.

The neighborhood crime lord, played superbly by Pete Postlethwaite, controls the every move of the gang and takes his ""fair"" share while leading through intimidation - all while trimming roses! Renner's sister and Affleck's previous squeeze is played alarmingly (and surprisingly) well by Blake Lively. She appears to have a nice little career ahead of her.

The frustrating thing with this film is that we have seen it all before, just without the heavy bean-town accents. Tons of automatic weaponry lead to very few actual injuries or deaths - always the sign of a cheesy shootout. The finale for Renner, Hall and Affleck are all advertised well in advance of the actual occurrence, which pretty much ends the suspense. On the bright side, the film is well made and entertaining enough. For a much better film on the culture of local/family crime check out ""Animal Kingdom"".",6
16 November 2017,Good balance of storytelling and action,"For a film with such a dull and uninspiring title, 'The Town' is surprisingly bold and original. It effectively balances an interesting and engaging storyline with some great action sequences. Heist movies are always at risk of being generic and repetitive but this one ensures that never happens with an original, convincing plot and an interesting bunch of characters.

The crime genre has become increasingly stale and action-obsessed in recent years, so 'The Town' deserves credit for focussing on story and character development as much as action and violence. Great action films with credible plots are hard to come by these days, but 'The Town' is one of them.

8 February 2011,"Powerful and Outstanding Performances, Reasonable Thriller. Affleck succeeds it again in the direction.","Ben Affleck is a great surprise behind cameras since his directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone"", and here with the thrilling ""The Town"" he takes some of the same characteristics that made of his first film a good film about crime events in a city where the connections between ordinary people and criminals are very close. The film is very good but for some reason I thought that more could be added to make it a great film, more thrills, more violence and an excitement in a few moments but at least the dramatical parts are among the best in a film of this genre.

""The Town"" of the title is Charleston and the crime flies high there from the first scene presented in the film in a tense and well executed bank robbing made by Doug (Affleck), James (Jeremy Renner) and a few other partners. During the heist they decide to take a hostage with them, a female manager (Rebecca Hall), fearing that the cops would appear. After her release, Doug gets involved in a relationship with her, trying to see if she can give informations to the FBI (his inside level), and starts a romance with her (on the outside level he revels to be a very nice guy), hiding the fact that he kidnapped her, at last he starts to reevaluate his life as a robber and thinking of a new future in another town along with this great woman. Doug's problems while trying to reach this illusion are: 1) his dangerous friend James who doesn't like this relationship fearing that she might tell something to the police; 2) his boss (Pete Postlethwaite) who keeps sending more and more ""jobs"" for him to execute; 3) a young woman (Blake Lively) interested on him that only knows how to provoke this guy 4) and, of course, a headstrong FBI Agent (Jon Hamm) who is getting closer to the group of thieves.

There's nothing new in the plot of ""The Town"" except for the important fact the drama takes a new and interesting level that was more captivating than the suspense built through the whole story (based on the book by Chuck Hogan ""Prince of Thieves""). Among the great dramatical moments are all the scenes between Affleck and Hall, where his character shares with this frightened woman many things of his past without giving away about his life of crimes, and a surprising sincerity in his talks that makes her unarmed against this guy, who simply appeared in her life in her worst life moment and he created that terrible moment. This contrast was excellent! And a scene where he visits his father (the excellent Chris Cooper) in jail, another great moment. The heist scenes, the car chase and the conclusion are among the nice action sequences, but I was expecting more energy coming out of it, to make me glued in the seat wanting more. It delivers something good, it is well made but it had potential to be more.

""The Town"" performed well at the box office, and that's why everybody heard things about the film and the awards nomination (including Oscar) to the great Jeremy Renner. While I do think there's things to be praised about him and his acting here (the accent and a different tone of voice, his mannerisms and a dangerous look), I still think that there wasn't so much for all this awards buzz. Why's that? I expected him to be a more menacing character with violent and shocking moments, and someone with more important lines, more than just mumbling words. He should be the character of who we can't take our eyes off, with a powerful screen presence where we would have the chance to be surprised with his next moves because he's a very unpredictable guy and we haven't seen much of that (except in his scene with Hall and when he and his friend beat up a guy in the apartment). Jon Hamm was much more effective and interesting as the FBI agent and he should be the one nominated for the awards (even though my preference between the ignored names would be Andrew Garfield for ""The Social Network""). But, again, Renner's is quite good here but not enough for this Oscar, SAG and Golden Globe talks. Affleck is amazing in the main role in a very mature character, he's the element of surprise here; Rebecca Hall also amazing because she has the ability in playing such a high range of different roles that you forget about the actress and think more of her performance, her character, she totally disappears behind them and that is a great work. The late Pete Postlethwaite delivers an outstanding performance here, sad that his screen time is so short but he stole the show for himself and gladly Bafta was gentle enough to remember of his performance here, and instead of Renner they nominated him, a name that didn't make it in these awards lists.

It is a good film, with powerful moments. More could have been made to be a more appealing film to me. 9/10",9

21 September 2010,Believable and gritty as well as thrilling and fast paced!,"'THE TOWN': Five Stars (Out of Five)

Ben Affleck, like many 'A' list celebrities, has had a career of pretty big ups and pretty low downs. He broke on to the scene as a regular in Kevin Smith movies, first as a supporting antagonist in 'MALLRATS' and then as the romantic lead in the critically acclaimed 'CHASING AMY'. He followed that up by winning an Oscar for co-writing 'GOOD WILL HUNTING', with buddy Matt Damon, and was poised for super stardom as well as critical darling fame but instead he went for almost solely the paycheck and did one big, mostly critically panned, blockbuster after another. Then he made four critical and financial duds in a row in 2003 and 2004 ('GIGLI', 'PAYCHECK', 'JERSEY GIRL' and 'SURVIVING Christmas') and smartly laid low and disappeared for a couple years after that. He took some time to 'reinvent himself' and broke back on to the scene in 2006 with a Golden Globe nominated performance in 'HOLLYWOODLAND' (as well as a small impressive ensemble turn in 'SMOKIN' ACES') and then surprised almost everyone with his critically showered directorial debut in 'GONE BABY GONE' (which he also co-wrote the screenplay). He stayed behind the camera and let brother Casey star in what became one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2007. Now he's back co-writing and directing again to even more impressive results (as well as starring this time around) with 'THE TOWN' which is easily one of the best films of the year.

In the film Affleck plays anti hero Doug MacRay the leader of a team of bank robbers living in Charlestown, a neighborhood in Boston that (as the movie informs us very early on) is the world's capitol for bank robberies (as well as other crimes). Apparently crooks are bread there and the business is passed down from father to son. While pulling a heist, at the opening of the movie, Doug and his crew take a bank manager (played by Rebecca Hall) hostage. They let her go only to discover she lives just a few blocks away from them. Doug takes it upon himself to find out how much information she knows and might be giving to the authorities and ends up falling for her. This causes drama with his best friend James (played by Jeremy Renner, last year's Oscar nominee for 'THE HURT LOCKER') who also is upset with Doug's plans of skipping town (after of course 'one more big job'). There's additional conflict brought on by two FBI agents (played by 'MAD MEN's Jon Hamm and 'LOST's Titus Welliver, the 'Man in Black') whom are trying to find enough evidence to put the boys away for good. Blake Lively co-stars as Jame's single mother sister and Doug's ex girlfriend who's had her problems with drugs.

The film is rich in character drama and intriguing dialog which makes the action that much more compelling and the action is breathtaking; it's believable and gritty as well as thrilling and fast paced. It kind of puts the viewer in an odd place seeing as your kind of influenced into rooting for the 'bad guys', which seems more and more common in film lately. That's the power of film though; a movie like this can present these guys to you, who do horrible things, and you still end up feeling sorry for them and relating to them on some level. A great deal of that is thanks to the writing and Affleck's amazing directing. He has such a key eye for interesting visuals that it's kind of remarkable to think he starred in so many cheesy half ass-ed movies. The acting is all outstanding as well especially Affleck and Renner (who makes a great 'wild card'). The film is based on the award winning novel 'Prince Of Thieves' by Chuck Hogan which won the Hammett Prize in 2005 for 'excellence in crime writing'. The film already has a ton of Oscar buzz around it and I predict it will at least get a best picture nod and hopefully directing for Affleck as well. Some say it might be a little too violent for the Academy's taste but if you think about it three out of the last four movies to win best picture were all violent action films ('THE HURT LOCKER', 'THE DEPARTED' and 'NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN'). This film is in the same league as those, in my personal opinion better, I believe it will be long remembered as a classic crime drama. Yet another masterpiece from Ben Affleck!

17 September 2010,Well done!!,"I had a trip to 'the town' last night and well, it is surprisingly entertaining. I still can't believe Ben Affleck can pull off everything (story, screenplay, direction, starring in a lead role) with such an ease. Three years after his debut directional venture 'Gone Baby Gone', Ben comes up with an ever better one this time.

A perfect combo of sold story, captivating screenplay, amazing writing, brilliant character development, good emotional content and brilliant cinematography (watch out for the shaky camera, this is the best camera work I've seen after 'Bourne' series) all together delivers an entertaining action thriller...worth a watch.

19 September 2010,Affleck Helms A Tour-de-Torce Bank robbery Thriller,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston.

26 September 2010,A very good crime thriller,"When Ben Affleck was a rising star back in the late nineties he had earned respected for staring in films like Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare in Love and Dogma, and big bucks from blockbusters such as Armageddon. But his career went downhill when he starred in critical flops like Pearl Harbor, Daredevil and worst of all Gigli, with his then fiancé Jennifer Lopez. But he has had a hell of a comeback, directing the crime thriller Gone Baby Gone and having a supporting role in State of Play. His comeback is now complete with The Town and shows that Affleck is an excellent director in the making.

Set in Boston, the area of Charlestown is an area famous for being the bank robbery capital of the world and producing more bank robberies then anyways. Doug MacRay (Affleck) runs a gang of bank robbers, including his hot headed friend James 'Jem' Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), getaway driver Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (Slaine) and youngster Desmond 'Dez' Elden (Owen Burke). After robbing a bank in Cambridge the gang kidnap bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) as a hostage. With the FBI involved Doug sets out to silence the woman and ends falling for the woman. FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is on the hunt, the gang continue with their operations, being lead by Irish crime lord the Floirist (Pete Postlehewaite).

With a great cast Affleck directs an effective film. The Town is best film I have seen Affleck perform and he is convicting in his role as a gangster with at least some morals. Hall was excellent as a woman overcoming post-traumatic stress disorder and falls for Doug as rebound reaction. Renner continues to raise with another fine performance as a man with anger issues and a near sociopath and Hamm's role was very similar Al Pacino's in Heat. Postlehewaite also gave a very good Irish accent and a sinister performance. Hopefully there are some award nods for Hall and some of the supporting actors.

The script written by Affleck, Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard was a well crafted, plotted affair with well rounded characters all round. Affleck's direction was well paced and allowing for well crafted action and crime scenes and a moments of character development and emotional depth. There is a gritty style but does not linger on violence or being stereotypical. Affleck does seem to be influenced by Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, Michael Mann and similar directors: he is serious for the most part and does not sugarcoat things. With excellent cinematography and editing Affleck directs some excellent action sequences in a realistic manner and shows that action does not need a $100 Million budget. There are no elements that drag the film out and the crime scenes were done with effect and pace. They were believable and well thought-out. There is a excellent opening bank robbery sequence with the team in Halloween masks, which was clearly influenced by The Dark Knight. Affleck also has a dark sense of humour to help little the film occasionally. But Affleck does seem to like his helicopter and skyline a bit to much: yet as a criticism it is a minor one.

This is a film with a heart and a brain.

Affleck seems to be on the road to being the next Clint Eastwood.",8

19 September 2010,"/taut, well acted and edited -- see it!","The Ben Affleck saga is well chronicled in these reviews. Pretty boy hunk, to blockbuster star, to paparazzi darling, to yearly ""razzie"" nominee. I'm not sure the ""razzies"" were warranted, by his movie choices got decidedly weaker as his star was falling. Eventually he took some strong supporting roles to get back on track and now has grabbed the director reins with both hands.

""The Town"" is placed in and about my loved Boston. ""Ahh, ahh, Boston you're my home"". By choosing Charlestown (now a yuppier ""Chuckville"") as its base, the North End for a car chase and the bowels of old (1912) Fenway for the climactic ""last job"", he is at home in his surrounding. Anyone who has walked thru the North End, stopped for a ""slice"" and checked out the streets knows that's the last place you'd ever expect a high speed car chase. Ben's camera work and editing makes it a thrilling, crash filled event. Pity the poor stunt drivers who has to careen around those corners!

So, lots of reviews tell the plot points. I'm just writing to voice my opinion on the entertainment value and that is very high. Though its over two hours, it never drags. Ben gives each of his excellent cast a very strong scene or two. Chris Cooper gets 5 minutes of screen time and is excellent. Rebecca Hall, the prettiest average looking person you'll see, is terrific. Jeremy Renner is calm and explosive, at the same time. Jon Hamm gets to look cool, be cool and stay cool. He is a different FBI than we are used to. Smart, but with a meaner edge. And, for me, last but not least, Blake Lively. I hear she's a glamor girl on TV and red carpets, but here she absorbs the role of broken, damaged and desperate, with a glob of mascara in each eye. One review I read said ""she's no Amy Ryan"" (see:""Gone Baby Gone""). Maybe not, but that's pretty unfair and she is well up to the task here.

So, action, anti-heroes to ""root"" for and Fenway Park (a diamond on the outside, pretty scruffy underneath)!! What's not to like? But I've got to nit-pick one thing. Does everyone in the world have a 3 day beard??? FBI guys go to the office unshaven for days? Ben even has some uneven moments where he goes from 2 to 1 to 3 day beards in the same caper! Hey, what can you do, its not one big long shoot, but it was a lot of stubble!",8

19 January 2011,Nice Crime Picture,"Town, The (2010)

*** (out of 4)

Affleck's second stint as director is a well-made but somewhat flawed crime picture set in Charlestown, MA, which we're told has the highest amount of robberies. Affleck plays Doug MacRay, the leader of a group of thieves who must follow the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) who they just previously robbed. MacRay must find out how she's handling the robbery in the aftermath and soon the two begin to fall in love, although she doesn't know who he is. This here sets forward a wide range of events, which aren't going to sit well with MacRay's crew, the FBI agent (Jon Hamm) following them or the crime boss (Pete Postlethwaite) who oversees everything. THE TOWN isn't nearly as effective as Affleck's previous film GONE BABY GONE and perhaps that's because this was released by a major studio as a blockbuster film. Whenever you release something with a higher budget then you must try and give a large group of people what they wanted. I won't spoil anything in GONE BABY GONE but thing would never have played out like they did had the budget been double and the studio was trying to push a blockbuster. THE TOWN is a very effective movie and it appears Affleck and crew want to really dig deep into families that continue in crime but in the end it starts to pull some punches and we're left with a good looking but entertaining crime picture. The ending has thousands of rounds of ammunition fired, several people killed and of course a lot of other action. I just couldn't help but feel that this was against everything that had led up to this point because there are several characters and subplots that briefly get mentioned and then are forgotten about. This includes a scene where Affleck goes to see his father (Christ Cooper) in prison. There's stuff with Affleck and his best friend and partner in crime (Jeremy Renner), which seems to have a lot of stuff that goes unexplored. Perhaps the longer Director's Cut will contain some more of this stuff. With that said, this picture looks extremely good as the action is held together very well by Affleck and he turns in a strong performance as well. Hall and Hamm are also very impressive in their roles and it's always great seeing Cooper and Postlethwaite even when they don't appear for very long. Renner easily steals the film as the rather cracked out and overly violent partner. Anyone familiar with crime pictures are going to find a lot of the material here familiar. I think what makes the film stand apart are the brief examples of it trying to connect the violence being passed down from father to son. Again, hopefully more of this is explored in the longer cut of the film but this theatrical cut is still worthy of being watched even if it doesn't reach perfection.",
4 August 2022,Old School Crime & Drama,"Affleck directs and stars in the crime drama about a smart thief trying to make his exist, when a teller of a bank becomes an unplanned hostage - and then an unplanned love interest. Hamm is heading up the FBI team tracking down Affleck's mob..and its a gritty fest right up to the ending.

27 September 2010,Solid film,"Ben Affleck's sophomore directorial effort is a solid one. He makes good use of his name in showbiz to put together a great cast and weave an entertaining story with no shortage of the elements of what a good heist film should be. The Town centers around a group of friends who rob banks and cause mayhem in the town of Charlestown. When the gang's leader, Doug MacCray (Affleck), gets too involved with a witness to one of their robberies (Hall) things get heated within the group as well as outside it, as the FBI begins to crack down on these robberies. The Town, while never skimping on the high quality, fast paced, action, ends up being a strongly character driven story, making it a good heist film to watch, while also delivering a substantial amount of intelligence that many films of this genre lack.

I think it's safe to say that Affleck has proved himself much more worthy of the director chair rather than an acting role. Obviously Affleck stars in this film and is as mediocre as you'd expect (no offense to the guy, I respect his other talents) but he by no means drags the film down. Plus the rest of the cast makes up for anything his acting can't bring to the table. Jeremy Renner, in particular, plays his role as Affleck's short tempered best friend incredibly well. The relationship between these two is the focus of the film, and what they do branches out to the other characters, most of which play an important role. The handsomely brilliant Jon Hamm plays the hard boiled FBI agent in charge of bringing down these criminals by whatever means necessary. He fits the key role of the morally skewed cop that serves to elevate the popularity of our anti-hero protagonists. Rebecca Hall plays the bank clerk who is taken hostage by Affleck and his crew at the beginning of the film, not knowing that she'd fall for the leader of this crew later. The relationship between Affleck and Hall was the only thing I didn't completely buy as far as character development goes, but this storyline served it's purpose, and played an important role in the cathartic ending of the film.

There is honestly nothing I can really criticize The Town for. Affleck's directing is effective, the dialouge is viscerally excellent, the film stands out in its effluent character development, and the acting is superb. The Town possesses all the elements of a good film that is well worth the watch. It's an effective blend of story and action, just what is needed in a good heist film. The Town is in no way groundbreaking and it doesn't revolutionize the genre, but it holds its own against the greats of the genre and fits right in with the criteria for a good story about cops and robbers. In this regard I can most highly commend this film for not trying to be more than it was. This movie never forgets what kind of movie it is, and it doesn't try to soar to new heights. It serves to exemplify what this genre is all about, and is an all around solid film.",7
19 December 2010,An awfully long commercial,"Bad guys rob banks and armored cars. That's new and exciting. Cops are onto them but lack evidence. That's new and exciting. Bad guys drink Budweiser exclusively and blatantly. That's not quite so new if not exciting. If I didn't know better I'd think I was just watching a two hour Bud commercial while I wait for the movie to resume. How come they can't show beer commercials on TV, but the movies? Hey, the more the better. We already pay plenty to watch endless commercials on TV and now Hollywood expects us to fork over big bucks to watch an endless array of commercials at the movies. Bud isn't alone. But this Bud wasn't for me.

16 September 2010,One of the best movies of the year,"Last night I saw the sneak peek of the Town. Driving for 30 minutes and waiting in the huge line to get into the theatre I thought to myself, this film better be worth it. I can tell you now, I was not disappointed. This film delivered in so many ways. Ben Affleck surprised me again with his screenplay, directing and acting, showing me that he is a force in this world. The rest of the casting was brilliant as well. Jeremy Renner was breathtaking as Gem, playing the troubled and hardened career criminal. Blake Lively stunned me as Krista. I did not think she had the skill to pull off such a character and she delivered in all of her scenes. Pete Postlewaite has some amazing dialogue and is frighteningly amazing in his role. Overall this movie absolutely delivers because of the emotional content that allows the audience to become attached to the characters, and the amazing action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. All in all, I must say that this is one of the best films of the year.

27 September 2010,Best heist film since Heat,"There seems to be two camps when it comes to Ben Affleck, those that adore him and those that abhor him. No matter which camp you belong to it is hard to deny that his directorial debut Gone Baby Gone was anything less than terrific. So now comes the moment of truth, is he going to succumb to the sophomore slump or will he cement his status as a talented director? With The Town, Affleck takes on triple duty, as writer, director and lead actor and manages to deliver on every front.

Within the blue-collar town of Charlestown, Massachusetts lays a legend of bank robbery. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) leads a team of friends and professional bank robbers. During the robbery of a Cambridge bank, the team takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. Following the release of Claire the team discovers that she lives nearby. Hothead Jem Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) offers to confront Claire in order to figure out what she knows. Fearing Jem's penchant for trouble, Doug insists that he approach Claire. After revealing her hostage experience to Doug, the two develop an intimate relationship. Having tired of his life of crime, Doug decides that he wants a change. Unfortunately, getting out won't be easy, he must first face the investigations of FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and the demands of boss Fergie Colm (Peter Postlethwaite).

There wasn't a bit about this film that I didn't like. The cast is magnificent. With any film set in the Boston area you run the risk of the actor resting too hard on what he thinks is a Boston accent rather than an accurate one. Having been a Boston resident for five years, I believe that I can spot this difference. I can say with all honesty and without reservations that this film nails that accent. Even Blake Lively, easily the weakest link, seems genuine. Obviously, the performance of the actors isn't entirely based on the Boston accent, but I would be remiss if I didn't comment on it.

As for the actual acting, it is damn good. This may be Affleck's most complex and best performance of his career. He is controlled and precise in his actions. In every way, Affleck completely becomes MacRay, and that is saying something. I think it speaks to the quality of the actors when you root for a criminal and against an FBI agent. I have seen some reviewers bashing Blake Lively's performance but I'm going to cry foul. She is easily the weakest actor of the big names involved, but let's look at who she's swimming with, Rebecca Hall, Affleck, Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner, all working at the top of their game. Lively is completely convincing, in fact I know that I've seen girls just like her character in the sketchier areas of Boston, with the obvious addendum that they aren't nearly as attractive. This film could have easily remained a simple heist film, but the actors involved elevate it to something darker and with many more layers.

The action is fantastic. Every heist is orchestrated beautifully. The audience is brought to the edge of its seat and it is often difficult to figure out just who you are rooting for. Some recent action films, especially following The Bourne Supremacy, have relied on the use of ""shaky"" hand-held cameras that when used inappropriately make the action difficult to follow. Affleck not only puts away the shaky camera but also shows that a nice steady shot can work even better. The action is always coherent and riveting. It was also nice to see a Boston film that was most definitely shot in Boston. A robbery that takes place in the North End, an area littered with narrow streets, benefits from this attention to detail and loyalty to the area. Affleck doesn't seem content in allowing his film to fade away in the pantheon of heist films; rather he crafts a film that will be remembered as one of the best.

Ben Affleck is one talented guy. Proving that Gone Baby Gone wasn't just a fluke, he returns to the director's chair to produce a film that is one of the year's best. Every part of the film is fantastic. Every member of the cast, yes even Blake Lively, gives everything they have giving performances that are genuine and not bogged down by inauthentic Boston accents. The action is nearly musical in its execution. Each action set piece is gripping and does not let down your expectations. The Town is a well-crafted and complex character study that also happens to be the best heist film since Heat.

Grade: A",10
14 June 2023,With friends like these....,"It seems to be the going thing these days to make movies 2+ hours long for reasons I will never understand as it usually does nothing except annoy viewers. The Town is another example of this.

Major movie companies have more than enough money to employ people who are able to fit a story inside 100 minutes. As I say, there is no profitable reason for not doing so, but alas once again we have our mental stamina put to the test with this movie.

I'm a fan of Ben Affleck's movies. He has a presence and talent that is rare and unmistakable. Here he's a ruthless bank robber, who with his gang of uncompromising members, reaks havoc and spreads terror as they go about their business. Not exactly a 'feel good' movie but Affleck's portrayal of Doug is mostly reachable and his girlfriend Claire, played by Rebecca Hall, is a likeable character who reflects a common need among young people living alone to seek company and relationships. The main storyline here seems to be concerned with hers and his obvious difference in lifestyles and the naivety of Claire to not want to see past his charm and personality. This works well as they both give credible performances and it also provides a soft touch to an otherwise violent film. However it drags on for too long and by the end of the movie I was relieved it was over. Which I'm sure isn't what the makers would want for viewers, but I won't be alone in feeling that way.

Action sequences are another plus in this, with exciting camera views and slickness of movements. 6 out of 10 from me, for a show that has its good points but a bit too monotonous.",6
11 February 2011,classy crime thriller,"Following Gone. Baby Gone, the re-invention of Ben Affleck continues apace with this highly satisfying crime thriller set in and encapsulating the Boston neighbourhood of Charlestown. Affleck is Doug, the hood with a heart of gold, the brains of a crew that includes loose canon James. When he falls for a bank clerk from one of his raids, and then inserts himself in her day-to-day life, the consequences prove lethal.

The plot complicates and unravels deliciously, but it is the characters and their intertwining neuroses that keep your attention here. Doug is cut from the same cloth as De Niro's character in Heat, a man whose moral compass is askew with regard to social mores, but rigid within the terms of his own world. James, on the other hand, is Begbie from Trainspotting, or Edward Norton in Rounders, a walking liability whose moral code, if he has one, is known only to himself. The Town may lack originality, but it pays off in spades in terms of genre expectation. Doug's motivations are tied up with not wanting to be his Dad (the ever-competent Chris Cooper), fretting about abandonment by Mum at the age of six, and carrying the regret of failing to be a contender when pro ice hockey gave him a shot.

Love interest Clare (Rebecca Hall) has family ghosts of hero own to deal with. Doug and Clare meet across the soiled socks in the laundromat, a low-key affecting scene that Affleck controls with aplomb. The critics who in recent years called him washed up as an actor must be hiding behind the couch.

The only wobble is Pete Postlehwaite as the local crime kingpin, in his ultimate role, oozing his usual visual charisma but making an unfortunate accent choice. The mother storyline, also, resolves in a manner you will see coming from miles away.

The Boston locality is utilized evocatively, and the whole thing moves along with pace and verve. Affleck has proved himself an astute filmmaker in recent years. Good to have him back.",8

So the FBI knows all the time who the bank robbers are but for some reason they are allowed to keep going. The main witness from the first robbery falls in love with a mysterious Ben Affleck, 4 days after the robbery and despite her claim that she remembers all their voices. And of course the flower shop would have been raided years ago. This script is a joke. Three stars for the excellent camera work and for the fact that finally an Affleck movie in which he is not crying. That aside... not much of anything.

27 May 2023,Spendid and nail-biting thriller with a competent cast including top-notch actors,"Violent and gloomy action film about impressive robberies with all-star-cast giving terrific acting . In The Town , a crew of tough thieves from execute virtually impossible heists. The tough crew of violent robbers and career criminals consisting of a motley team who leave their Charlestown (Boston) life on their own volition, the neighborhood where there is an unwritten code to protect that lifestyle. Such robbers include Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) , leader of the ecclectic gang , comprised of his best friends James ""Jem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert ""Gloamy"" Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond ""Dez"" Elden (Owen Burke). Doug MacRay, was an ex-champion of Ice Hockey who left his team in lousy circumstances . Meantime, FBI Detectives (Jon Hamm , Titus Welliger) are working to foil the criminals. A last heist that goes wrong , triggering a series of fateful happenings when then rob a bank and hold Claire (Rebecca Hall) , the assistant manager, hostage . Things begin to get complicated when one of the crew members falls in love with Claire. Welcome to the bank robbery capital of America !.

This is a breathtaking thriller with shootouts, strong violence , twists , turns , breakneck, action-packed finale filled with double-crosses, greed and revenge. The plot is plain and simple , the typical heist carried out by a motley group , but it goes awry , an ordinary theme we have already seen in other films , here with the novelty that the peculiar gang of criminals are laced by family ties and blackmailed by a ruthless villain -brief but terrific acting by Pete Postlethwaite- in order to pull off their biggest heist yet across town. It results to be a bitter meditation on deceiving , defeat , vengeance , treason , disenchantment and redemption.

19 September 2010,"Nothing special, but not terrible","I thought this movie was an acceptable way to pass some time, but overall was nothing terribly special. The few action scenes were pretty interesting and creative though--it was the parts in between that I didn't really enjoy much. If the entire movie was as good as the action sequences, it definitely would've received a 6 or 7 from me.

I don't think Ben Affleck is an especially good actor, and I thought he wasn't especially good in this. I didn't believe in his character much-- he didn't really seem like a bad guy to me. I didn't think there was much chemistry between him and his character's love interest. I didn't think Jon Hamm was all that good either--he didn't really seem like an FBI guy to me. I thought Jeremy Renner stole the show. Chris Cooper was excellent, as usual, but had only a small role. I thought Rebecca Hall was pretty good.

Certain portions of the plot were a little silly, but I don't want to spoil anything. Overall, I guess if you're really big on crime movies, you should probably see this just for the crime parts, because they are pretty cool. As a whole, however, this isn't particularly good or particularly bad.",5
12 February 2011,Decent film,"4 armed robbers from the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston push their limits and actually rob a bank in stead of going for the money delivery guys. After the heist is successfully accomplished, the young attractive bank manager (Rebecca Hall) they just robbed, turns out to live just a block away from the house our 4 friends live in. One of the robbers (Affleck) decides to approach her to find out if she has anything on them. In stead of keeping things professional, he manages to fall in love with her and starts to pursue a relationship.

'The Town' is Ben Affleck's second feature production as a director and did right by not including his brother Casey this time around. The film is pacey, reasonably well acted, maintains tension throughout and produces some very good action scenes. The only major downfall is the somewhat unbelievable love interest that develops between Affleck and Hall. Pete Postlethwaite makes a short but memorable appearance in what turned out to be his last but one performance in a major production before his demise in January 2011.

1 April 2018,The Town turns up the 'Heat' to deliver a tantalising thriller.,"Affleck gets slack off screen, and yes occasionally some of his performances are lacklustre. But when he is in full control of his own film, he becomes this formidable swirling vortex that chews up every scene. The Town is a great example of just that. A band of Charlestown residents perform bank robberies where during one of them they take a woman hostage. The ring leader of this group of misfits rapidly falls in love with her and attempts to protect her and his delinquent brother simultaneously. It's not the most original thriller ever, in fact it follows a narrative flow similarly to the likes of 'Heat' and 'Point Break'. However what differentiates this from them is the equal dosage of characterisation and adrenaline. The brotherly love between the two lead characters is conveyed to be a complex conflict for authoritative power within their unit. Each decision made by one is being questioned by the other. It's a ferocious relationship but one that is fuelled by love and respect, two traditions valued heavily within Boston raised families. Then to embed the intricate blossoming romance with the hostage that inevitably crumbles into desolation is just genius storytelling. Allowing us to become invested in these characters who do anything to survive the harsh environment of Charlestown. Affleck manages to use Boston as an incarnation to represent his own character. Rough around the edges with a warm bustling centre. His directing style is taut, tense and thrilling and certainly cements him as a talent behind the camera. His performance onscreen is then unequivocally matched by everyone. Hall, Hamm, Cooper and especially Renner all deliver exceptionally gritty portrayals as they bring life to these damaged individuals. The robberies and chase sequences were electric with frenetic editing to keep the action thrilling. There are certain sub-plots that are underdeveloped such as Lively's character, trying to pack too much into a two hour runtime. However, this heist thriller remains one of the best.",8
19 May 2012,"Thin, Weak, and Unsuccessful","Very Thin Urban Crime Thriller that is Weak, because it simply attempts to be more than it is. Even the overall Template of the ""Town"" given much Script Time falls Short of Endearing its Charm and it all seems to have a Patina of Plastic Overlay.

The Buddy bits are Not Convincing or realized and the coupling of the Criminal and the Victim as Lovers seems Forced, Facile, and Artificial.

It is a Movie that draws attention to what it is not rather than what it is. An Unsuccessful effort at a Multi-Layered, Sentimental yet Hard Boiled Gangster Tale of Family, Friends, and the Futility of an Environmental Entrapment.

Some Stylish and Exciting Action Sequences Saves the Film from Wispy Indifference.

5 February 2011,A Decent Gangster Movie,"There's a lot to like about this movie. Not the least of which is simply the knowledge gained that Charlestown, Massachussetts - a suburb of Boston - is apparently a breeding round for bank robbers. That may not be a great selling point for Charlestown, Massachussetts - and it may not be an issue that's really addressed or explained in any way in this movie - but it's still an interesting piece of knowledge. One also has to appreciate the performances in this. Ben Affleck was very good as Doug MacRay - a local bank robber who's involved in a heist in which a young woman (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage, and who then falls for her and begins to develop a relationship with her (she not knowing who she is.) It's an interesting premise and - while the relationship does develop - this never falls into the trap of being a formulaic romance. The story really is about MacRay, whose growing relationship with Claire makes him want to leave the life, much to the chagrin of many of his partners in crime. That was an interesting story, made even more interesting by the fact that Claire discovers from the FBI who MacRay is and then obviously has a choice to make. The choice itself was the proper one, and the movie I thought ended on the proper note as a result.

What I didn't like was the depiction of the last job the gang did. It went on far too long and became (I thought at least) unnecessarily violent; little more than a shootout eventually that went on far too long and detracted from some of the very real human interest that was involved in MacRay's personal story. Yes, it provided an opportunity for a truly hair-raising car chase, but I still thought it was overdone and a bit inconsistent with the rest of the story, which was quite good.",7
5 July 2011,"Solid, compelling thriller that further solidifies Affleck as a director to be reckoned with","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

Doug Macray (Ben Affleck) is one of a group of career criminals who plan and carry out bank robberies in the Charlestown area of Boston. On the latest heist, bank worker Claire (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage and released under no uncertain terms that her life will be over if she talks to the cops. But with FBI Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) on their trail, Doug finds himself, as the most level headed and compassionate of the group, forced to work his way into Claire's life to keep tabs on her, especially when it emerges she identified a tattoo on the back of the neck of James (Jeremy Renner), a more aggressive and ruthless member of the group. As Frawley intensifies his chase, and the truth looks set to come out, Doug must work to stop everything exploding into hell around him.

Action is a genre that's started to feel especially generic and interchangeable in recent years, bereft of a lot of the inspiration and colour it enjoyed in it's halycon days of the 70s and, certainly, the 80s. It's high time something came by that resembled the days when it truly felt like an event, like something really thorough and satisfying. And even better that the emphasis isn't all on the big explosions and shoot outs, but with more than a dash of human dynamics thrown in, which gives the story that bit more edge and verve and makes you care about it and the characters that bit more. Ben Affleck's second directorial effort after the amazing Gone Baby Gone manages this, as well as further cementing him as a new directing talent to be reckoned with, competent and compelling, able to tell a brilliant story and charge it with enough emotion to make you stick with it to the end. It could certainly be argued he is a much better director than he is an actor.

Affleck, Hall, Renner and Hamm are the main players of the story, and it certainly helps that they are all on electrifying form, but even better that they have such a strong supporting cast in the shape of Balke Lively, Chris Cooper and, in what may have been his last role, the late Pete Postlethwaite, fierce and powerful as ever, but admittently looking rather pale and gaunt, on account of his deteriorating condition. Still, if it was the case, this is certainly a fitting swansong to head out on, one cog in part of a very well built machine. ****",9

3 October 2010,I'd disagree with most people about this being a 'Heist' movie,"Its a nice drama thriller - sure..but lets not get carried away and compare it to the Italian Job or Snatch or Ocean's 11 .. Its a well done drama thriller that I'd recommend but the way its being marketed as a Heist film left me feeling a little lukewarm after I left the theatre. There is none of that tension or excitement one gets when you are watching a carefully planned, brilliantly thought Heist ... or the suspense, drama and intrigue behind a Heist being executed ...infact that is not the focus of the movie at all. This is more about Ben Afleck and his mates and the obvious love story angle.

Enough said .... go and watch it ... if you liked Gone Baby Gone , you will like this one too ... but please - let us not compare this to the great Heist films !

28 November 2011,a potent mixture of crime procedural and human drama,"Based on the novel by Chuck Hogan, ""The Town"" is a superb drama set in Charlestown, Massachusetts, a neighborhood in Boston that has the dubious distinction of being the bank and armored-car robbery capital of the world. Writer/director Ben Affleck plays Doug MacCray, the leader of a sometimes unruly Irish gang that routinely engages in both those activities (the other members of the team include Jeremy Renner, Slaine, and Owen Burke). On one of their robberies, one of the members goes rogue by kidnapping an attractive bank manager and taking her along with them as a hostage. Although she is blindfolded the entire time and is eventually set free, several of the robbers fear she may still someday be able to testify against them were they ever to come to trial. To protect her against the more dangerous members of the group, Doug insinuates himself into her life and quickly finds himself developing a serious attraction to her.

""The Town"" works beautifully on so many different levels at once: as a thrilling crime-and-detection tale, a complex human drama, and a richly textured account of life in an individual neighborhood. Doug may be torn between his criminal background and the love of a good woman who offers him a chance at a better life - but that doesn't stop him from still partaking in many of the foul deeds that have come to define his life over the years. If anything, ""The Town"" shows just how deeply planted are the roots that bind us to the soil (i.e., neighborhood) of our past - and how hard it is to rip ourselves free from them and still continue to flourish. In other words, it may be possible for a man to redeem himself in the eyes of God and his fellow citizens, but it may be a long and faltering journey on the way to that outcome.

As a character, Claire (Rebecca Hall) is equally three-dimensional and complex. She's a decent, hardworking young woman who tends her own garden in the city and volunteers her time in helping the youth in her community. When she meets Doug, she is still traumatized by the events that have happened to her and is initially unaware that Doug had any part in them, believing him to be just an easygoing, compassionate man with whom she's falling in love. How she'll react when she finds out the truth about Doug and how that revelation will affect their burgeoning relationship provides the key emotional focal point of the drama.

Running contrapuntally to the romance is the attempt on the part of the FBI, led by John Hamm (minus his Don Draper Brylcreemed hair), and the Boston Police Department to capture the band of thieves. There are moments of breath-bating suspense as the law inexorably closes in on its target, and Affleck proves once again that that much abused standby known as the ""car chase"" can still be a potent storytelling device when we actually care about what happens to the characters – even those it is not always all that easy to like.",8

27 August 2022,"Affleck does an excellent job, where Jeremy Renner particularly stands out.","I really enjoyed this film, where action, drama and romance are mixed in a well-balanced and intelligent way. The script is set in Boston, and takes us to meet a group of professional bank robbers, some of them with criminality in their blood and with incarcerated parents. The group makes an ostentatious robbery in which they force the manager to open the safe, and to go with them in the escape, as a human shield. Later, fearing that she might recognize them, one of the robbers decides to keep an eye on her, but ends up approaching her and starting a more personal relationship, which could threaten the group's illegal activities.

The screenplay is very well written and is intelligent in the way it presents itself and develops. It is not an original film, it brings elements and themes that have been repeated in cinema several times, and in much better films. Other than that, the film isn't particularly memorable or very impressive. Therefore, we cannot expect a brilliant work, but a good piece of cinema, which entertains us satisfactorily while it lasts.

Ben Affleck takes on the direction as well as the lead role, and he proved to be very confident and capable in both tasks. A recognized actor, he shines in the role of the heartthrob, and makes good use of his personal charisma. Jeremy Renner, however, shines in a very special way, managing to leave us here one of the most complete and powerful works of his career as an actor (not as impressive as ""Hurt Locker"", but truly impressive). Rebecca Hall does an equally positive job, she is very beautiful and attractive, but she gives us a character full of content, personality and charisma. John Hamm, Chris Cooper and Blake Lively also don't let themselves be left behind and punctuate their work with high quality notes.

Technically, the film deserves a positive mention for the quality of the visual, special and sound effects, especially with regard to the action scenes. The film has plenty of action for moviegoers, though it's not gory, and the chases and robberies are truly lavish and Hollywood-worthy. The film makes good use of filming locations and sets, and the cinematography is elegant, well-executed, and enhanced by a good job of editing. Unfortunately, everything else, including the soundtrack, is relatively average.",6

24 January 2011,Town of Thieves,"After seeing a series of bad Hollywood movies released in 2010 (with one exception called 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'), finally I find something worthy. Ben Affleck's 'The Town' is gripping, gritty, suspenseful but above all, human. While the film is very much plot driven as it revolves around a series of bank robberies, it is the excellently carved characters that stay with the viewers.

While I do see some resemblance to Michael Mann's 'Heat' especially how the romantic angle juxtaposes with the heist angle and the sequences leading to the conclusion, 'The Town' still remains its own film especially regarding how it's been written (storytelling and characters). Moreover, in addition to being a suspense thriller and a human drama, 'The Town' has plenty of dark humour.

While the story and characters are properly developed, 'The Town' is a well-made film with excellent editing, lighting, cinematography and score. The heist sequences are executed brilliantly. However, the sex scenes appear a little rushed.

Ben Affleck springs a surprise, both as actor and director. Even though he has delivered a few impressive performances (such as in 'Changing Lanes', 'Extract', 'State of Play' and 'Hollywoodland'), I never expected him to pull off someone as complex as Doug MacRay, but he does it effortlessly. It's good to see him develop into a fine actor. Likewise, I wasn't sure whether he, as director, would be able to pull off such a big movie with a complicated story, but he's done it.

The rest of the cast, that includes Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall, Chris Cooper, Pete Postlethwaite, Jon Hamm and Blake Lively are first rate. I never thought of Lively much as an actress but here she is brilliant as is Rebecca Hall, the traumatized bank manager who falls in love with one of her 'attackers'. Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner are terrific as the no-nonsense copper and ruthless psychopath, respectively. Postlethwaite and Cooper are scene stealers with their couple of scenes.

'The Town' is among the best heist movies of recent time. I would be looking forward to Affleck's future directorial ventures.",
21 March 2013,"Another Great Directing Effort from Ben Affleck,","The Town is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.This is another great directing job from Ben Affleck,who proves once again without any doubt that he can direct movies,this is his second project after Gone Baby Gone and,besides being crime movies,they are quite different,this movie is much more adventurous and thrilling,the conflict between the characters and the situation they are in will certainly keep audiences at the edge of their seats.The case all deliver great performances,particularly Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall,who had great chemistry,as well as Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm,who I found to be the two most interesting characters,Renner was unpredictable,while Hamm was willing to do anything in order to catch these criminals.It can be a bit slow at times,but the Town is still mostly intense and dramatic from start to finish,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime film or thriller.

While planning a complicated heist,a career criminal develops feelings for the victim of his latest robbery.

9 November 2011,Clichéd tale that brims with heart and authenticity,"Charlestown, Boston - a gang of bank robbers are preparing a heist. They break into the bank, rough up some of the employees, and gain access to the main vault. They escape, taking bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) with them. They eventually release her, telling her to walk until she feels the sea at her feet. It seems they have gotten away with it, but gang member Jem (Jeremy Renner) is restless and wants her taken care of after discovering she is from the same neighbourhood and may be able to identify one of them. Doug (Ben Affleck) takes responsibility, and he starts following Claire. They eventually start talking, and Doug finds himself falling for her. With FBI agent Frawley (John Hamm) closing in on the gang, Doug becomes disenchanted with the life of crime and longs to give it up, but will Jem, and more dangerously, will notorious big boss Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite), let him?

There's been a lot of interest in Boston of late. Most have focused on the element of crime and the way it seemingly flourishes there. The most popular are Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006) and Ben Affleck's debut film as director, Gone Baby Gone (2007). Affleck originated from Boston himself, and although he depicts it as a dangerous place to live and a place that bleeds criminals, he clearly has a love for the place. The Town benefits from this fact, as although its storyline is seeped in cliché, the film has a genuine authenticity to it that gives the film heart, and a real feeling of place.

Michael Mann's Heat (1995) is the main source where The Town takes its influence from. Without capturing the same neon beauty of Mann's crime masterpiece, The Town films its bank robbery set pieces with the same attention to detail, and exciting, breathless shoot-outs. It also has it's fair share of impressive performances - Renner, as the films token loose-canon, brims with subtle menace and eagerness to harm. He is very good, and fully deserves the attention he got from The Hurt Locker (2008), and the two Academy Award nominations that came from that and this. Jon Hamm looks like the film star he could become once he's done with Mad Men with a performance of fierce determination and arrogance, as his FBI man looks to catch these career criminals before they rob any more banks.

But with the good, comes the cliché. The central romance between Affleck and Hall is believable - they're two lost souls looking for someone to help them escape the existence that they currently hate - but you can't help thinking how gullible Hall is and how stupid Affleck is for getting involved with someone who could put him in jail for many years. Yet while the movie is ultimately formulaic, and contains character archetypes seen many times before, it remains frequently riveting. Complete with mumbling, Boston-accented dialogue, and real locations, the film's authenticity lifts the film out of the good and into the very good. Affleck may be a better director than actor, but he gives a strong performance here. If he does ever decide to go back into acting full time, let's hope he doesn't forget about directing, and hopefully he's sacked the agent that brought him the likes of Pearl Harbor (2001), Bounce (2000) and, of course, Gigli (2003).

19 September 2010,Worth investing a little time,"This movie is worth taking the time to go see. As a former cop and detective the way the FBI works on the suspects is very convincing. The fact that the crew was able to continue working with the cops knowing so much tended to keep this a solid escapism film.

The plot and sub plot worked well and reminded me of a nice pulp fiction story. I don't want to spoil any of the film so suffice it to say that it is worth going to see.

Jeremy Renner from the Hurt Locker was stellar, Jon Hamm pulled it off I never thought he was Don Draper, Rebeca Hall, and Ben Affleck were also good. The supporting cast did not disappoint either.

The cast made this movie work. I can honestly say I liked all the characters. Blake Lively acted just like her character would have in real life. She is the true victim of her environment and there was no redemption for her.",9
4 June 2023,Ineffective and Inefficient,"*Saw the Extended Cut*

Being a heist/crime thriller, there is no significant difference between this film and others with similar traits, except for the incorporation of a romantic involvement, which, in my opinion, was largely insignificant as it was utilized more as an expository instrument to relay information than something that was extremely crucial to the script's advancement. There are well-choreographed action and chase sequences, so I suppose die-hard action enthusiasts will find something to appreciate.

P. S. I wish Jeremy Renner had more screen time; he did a great job as James Coughlin, and I wanted to see more of him.

13 March 2022,Yawn! Am I the only one who found this boring?,"My review for 'The Town' could be summarized in a single word: YAWN.

The film is a about bank robbers, and the town in question is Charlestown, where bank robbery is a trade. Ben Affleck stars as bank robber, Doug MacRay, a member of a gang of four who regularly robs banks. I'm not going to bore you with the details (hell, I'm bored enough with this movie!!), so here goes.

'The Town' has a good opening sequence, but then moves incredibly slow from there for the sake of the romance interest. I actually got so bored waiting for something to happen that I found myself fondling with the forward button on the remote. I only became interested again about an hour into the movie when the next robbery took place, but in a whiff the action was all over.

There are two or three good action sequences, but keeping in mind this is a 2 ½ hour movie, that's not saying much. There's a heck of a lot of talking, talking, talking in between. And quite frankly, it wasn't interesting since most of it was about this stupid unconvincing 'love story'.

Doug comes across as sincere and is made out to be the film's hero, but when he gets boxed in, he goes trigger happy firing blindly (with a machine gun) at policemen (the good guys, let me remind you!), with no consideration whatsoever for human life. Doug's close friend, James (Jeremy Renner) is pure evil and deserved his fate.

If this wasn't based on fact, I would have hated the film's ending. But, having researched the actual events, the film is true to these events. It still makes for a boring movie with a dissatisfying ending.",3
5 January 2023,A bit average,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",5
26 September 2010,Very very good but not great,"This takes place in Charlestown--a small city in Boston. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is the leader of a gang of bank robbers. It was a tradition passed down to him by his father (Chris Cooper). At one robbery he falls in love with the manager of the bank named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). He starts to romance her NOT letting on he's a robber. His trigger happy gang member friend James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) is not happy. Meanwhile FBI Special Aggent Adam Frawley (Joe Hamm) is on hot on his trail.

Ben Affleck (who co-wrote, stars in and directs) was born and raised in Cambridge--a suburb of Boston. He knows the city and towns inside out and puts his knowledge to good use. I was born and raised near Boston too and it was fun to see it on the big screen. He correctly uses locations unlike other movies (1994's ""Blown Away"" had Boston City Hall used as the police department which caused a LOT of laughter when I saw it). He KNOWS how to direct--he uses slow-motion, different pitches of sound and never slows down. There are three exciting fast car chases in the movie which are incredible to watch. The one through the tiny streets of the North End must have been a nightmare to block and clear. There are also tons of shootouts but they (thankfully) aren't that bloody and there's a big explosive ending at Fenway Park. So why is this very very good but not great? The plot. It's been done millions of times before. There are no surprises here and it turns into more of a character study than an action movie. But it's well-acted and extremely well-directed so you're never really bored (even though it does have its slow spots).

Affleck easily gives his best performance EVER here. He flawlessly captures the Charlestown accent and his character is multi-layered and sympathetic. Hall doesn't have too much to work with but she's very good and beautiful. Hamm (who can be good) is just so-so in his role. He looks terrible and sometimes just seems to be going by the numbers in terms of acting. The biggest surprise is Renner. He has the meatiest role (the psycho gang member) and he UNDER plays it...and not very well. He seems muted and is always pulling back. Maybe he was directed that way but it doesn't work. There also Blake Lively as his sister. Her accent is a BIT too strong at times but she's very good.

A very very good movie. Just not for kids. There's tons of swearing and has strong violence. I give it an 8.",8
29 March 2021,Tries To Channel Heat,"The first thing that comes to mind when I think of this film or what I think of when watching this film is Heat. The Town keeps a safe distance from the 1995 neo-classic to avoid being considered a ripoff, but the similarities are still there. Of course, the basic premise and subject matter are alike but the similarities continue into the underlying themes and subplots. Now, despite drawing these comparisons The Town is still it's own film. And perhaps not a very good one.

The more dramatic moments in the film seem to drag the plot down rather than enrich it and the action isn't very intense.

Overall The Town is well paced and fairly intriguing and while no aspect is strikingly bad, neither does it distinguish itself in anyway.

22 September 2010,Ben Afflecks brilliant directing,"His performance in this was alright, but nothing Oscar worthy. But his directing was astonishing, he is like the next Clint Eastwood in directing. I never thought a crime drama and a love story can be well mixed together, and performances don't disappoint, from Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm, Chris Cooper, Blake Lively and Rebecca Hall.

In Charlestown, a gang of thieves led by MacRay(Ben Affleck) who prepare for a bank heist, they rob the bank wearing Halloween like masks, but take a bank teller(Rebecca Hall) hostage, in hopes to ward off the cops, they let her go. And she can't identify any of them. But MacRay is concerned about her, and he pursues her, and they quickly develop a realiontship. But will this complicate his next heist, and with his gang. And an FBI agent(Jon Hamm) who is slowly closing in on them.

A well made crime drama/love story, it is quite a tension grabber. You really get in to the characters. If loved Heat(1995), and The Departed(2006) then you'll love The Town.",9

15 April 2016,Great movie,"Great movie, despite starring, and being directed by, Ben Affleck. Decent plot, gritty, character-based but with plenty of action. Gritty, though maybe a touch unoriginal and too trite, especially with regard to the romantic angle.

Excellent direction (that's the biggest surprise) - the car chases are gripping but not overdone, the action is frenetic but not gratuitous, characters have time to be sketched, and some of the scenes could be straight out of the Tarantino playbook.

Excellent performances, all round. Ben Affleck is solid in the lead role - and it takes a lot for me to say that. I am generally not a fan of his work. Rebecca Hall is also very good as the romantic interest.

Performance of the movie must go to Jon Hamm though, as the clever, tough, no-nonsense FBI agent. Shows that he is not just a TV actor.

After been deservedly nominated for a Best Actor Oscar in The Hurt Locker, Jeremy Renner puts in another good performance in a tough- to-the-point-of being-psychotic role.

Watch this movie.",9
22 September 2010,"I was shocked, it was great!","I don't hate Ben Affleck. Many of the other contributers on this website might, but I never have. I wouldn't go so far as to call myself a ""fan"", but I wouldn't avoid a movie because he was in it. I will and have avoided Ben Affleck movies not because of the person, but because his filter (i.e. terrible movies) is apparently set at zero. He probably should have fired his agent somewhere around 2003-04. I mean, just IMDb his stream of hits between 2001 and 2004. Some of these movies were money makers, well, at least Pearl Harbor, but most were flops on a scale that would have derailed Tom Hank's career. Affleck has proved resilient through this, and believe it or not, people still give him money in the film making business. Matter of fact they give him creative control over his movies now.

That's right folks Ben Affleck is now not just an actor, but a writer/ director, and he's pretty good at it. The Town impressed me much more than I thought it would. The story is pretty generic: Guy robs bank, takes hostage, falls in love with said hostage, stalks her, protects her from accomplices, protects her from policeall of this handled in a way that doesn't seem pointless. The story actually works pretty well, and the sheer audacity of robbing Fenway Park is admittedly pretty cool. Yet, the main shortcoming of the movie, what keeps it from being an A is the story itself.

I can't help but wonder if the reason the movie succeeds rests more upon the acting of Ben Affleck, or his direction, than on the original story on which it was based, a book by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote Boston movies Mystic River, Shutter Island, and Affleck's first directing effort, Gone Baby Gone. No joke, Affleck knocks it out of the park playing gangster with a heart of gold (who never killed anybody) Doug MacRay. I bought the character from the beginning. He plays a very methodical bank robber, who keeps his cool no matter the situation. Jeremy Renner plays Doug's partner and best friend Jem, the id of the duo. Jem is played with almost unrestrained intensity, yet never in a cartoon way. He represents everything ""the town"", Charlestown, Ma, stands for, at least in Affleck's portrayal of the Boston suburb. He is fiercely loyal and ready to settle any situation with violence. This group dynamic and the action alone, make the movie worth seeing.

The romance part of the story, while not seeming tacked on, does feel unessential. It is used to tie a couple of things together, but everything we learn about the gang through this relationship could have been learned elsewhere. The more interesting, yet underdeveloped, relationship is between Doug and Jem's cracked out sister, Krista, played with disgusting authenticity by Blake Lively. Her story plays much more realistic and is more integral to the plot, although the climax of her story seems kinda out of nowhere. Once again I do not blame this on Afflecks direction, but on the source story itself. My initial rating of the movie after walking out of the theater was a B-; I just wasn't feeling something about it. I think it had to do with the unimportance of the love story. Upon reflection, I'll raise the grade to a solid B. Not a must see, but if it's on Netflix, check it out. The most important thing I got out of this movie was that Ben Affleck is an up and coming director, one who I will follow. I can definitely say that I want to see his next directed effort after seeing this film.

Rating = B",10

26 September 2010,The Town Proves Affleck is a Force to be Reckoned With,"The crime drama The Town is directed by Ben Affleck and stars Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, and Jeremy Renner. The film takes place in modern day Charlestown, Massachusetts.

The film starts off with four men preparing to rob a bank and they are lead by Doug MacRay (Affleck). They quickly take all the money and leave all the tracers behind and do a nice and easy job. Then the group takes the bank manager, Claire Keesey (Hall), hostage and bring her into their van. Then they drop her off at a beach and drive away. Afterwards the group discovers that the FBI is searching for them and have contacted Claire. So Doug follows Claire and then eventually talks to her at a Laundromat. They soon develop a romantic relationship. The rest of the film follows how the group does more bank robberies, while the FBI is trying to catch them and Doug and Claire's relationship gets more complex.

The screenplay for this film was very good. It was constantly entertaining and was extremely realistic. There was not one point in this film where I said ooh that would never happen, they just did it to build up the drama. All the characters had quite a bit of depth to them and were all pretty relatable. One could say that Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm's characters were stock characters but then again there are plenty of people like them. I was not a giant fan of the ending but I was satisfied with it. Also I enjoyed how there were so many bits of comic relief in here that just made it seem even more realistic.

Ben Affleck has been called the new Clint Eastwood, and to tell you the truth I think he might just be. Obviously it is not yet proved since he has only directed two films, but both of them are superb. Affleck got many memorable performances from his cast, even though he was busy being a member of the cast as well. Also Affleck had many complex shots that built up the tension. One of my favorite sequences in the film is with the group of robbers in the nun outfit and the police officer who sees them. I won't give away what happens but it was filmed brilliantly.

The acting in this film was great by almost everyone in the whole cast. Ben Affleck delivered his best performance yet in my opinion as the troubled bank robber who wants to end his ways and live a simple, happy life. The reason he probably gave such a brilliant performance was because he directed and co wrote the film so he knew exactly what he wanted. Rebecca Hall was also great as the bank manager who has a relationship with Doug. She was just a normal girl but was just so likable because of her innocence, I may say this is my favorite role of hers as well even though I haven't seen much of her work. Jeremy Renner gives another great performance as the on edge bank robber. Even though his character is a stock character in a way he just played the part perfectly. I can't say the same for Jon Hamm though because I think he just played the role as lead detective like any actor would. He did not add a sense of realism to his role. Blake Lively had a small part of the drug addicted sister of Jeremy Renner's character and gave a solid performance as well proving that she can be a serious actress. Chris Cooper is always great even though he was only in the film for one scene being Doug's father.

Overall I give this film a strong 8/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a smart crime drama. I am also proud to say that this is my favorite film of the year so far. I know what many of you are saying when you read this, what about Inception and Toy Story 3? Well to that I say neither of those films seems as real and full of emotion as this one. Yes, they are both fine films but this one is just more to my liking. I understand why the rest of you would like the other two better but the more I think about those two the more I dislike them even though I still do like them. Watch this film, it is the best bank robbery film in years.",8

19 September 2010,The Town is the Bomb!,"In the opening moments of the film, it is established that Charlestown, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston) is the bank robbery capital of the world. It is, according to the information offered the audience, a way of life there. In some cases, it spans generations. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is a man who lives up—or down—to the town's reputation.

Doug and his best friend, James ""Jem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) head up a small gang of very professional bank robbers. Their usual thorough planning and professional execution gets them in, out, and away from their target in short order. But a series of small hitches combined with Jem's short temper changes everything when he decides to take Bank Manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. Although Claire is released unharmed, Jem obsesses about what she may have seen or what she might know. To satisfy both Jem and his own doubts, Doug decides he'll find out.

Meanwhile, the FBI is obviously interested in a bank robbery, but the hostage gives Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) what he hopes will be enough information to catch the gang. With a number of agents and resources at his disposal, he begins his investigation by questioning Claire and then starts collecting information to help him identify and catch the robbers.

The secrets held close by the people of Charlestown, though, won't be given up easily and perhaps not without violence. Not to the FBI for sure, and perhaps not even to one of Charlestown's own as Doug soon begins to find out as he asks some questions of his own.

The Town is based on a 2005 book entitled ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan. The book was brilliantly adapted by Peter Craig, Ben Affleck, and Aaron Stockard. Affleck also directed The Town. In some cases, actors who try to do too much do a disservice to each of their jobs. In this case, though, Affleck proved his Oscar® for co-writing Good Will Hunting was no fluke, nor was his acclaimed directorial debut for Gone Baby Gone any accident. He writes and directs The Town with unbelievable skill, and then to top it off, his acting is just terrific.

Jeremy Renner doesn't play the most sympathetic of characters, but he makes Jem so real that it's difficult to judge him for his many flaws. Jon Hamm is entirely believable as a frustrated FBI agent, and Rebecca Hall meshes well with Affleck in their scenes together. The standout here (aside from Affleck, of course) is the surprising Blake Lively. In a role as Jem's troubled sister, she's nothing short of amazing. After the casting directors see her here, you can bet we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the future.

BOTTOM LINE: Even before its release, The Town was generating some very exciting buzz about Ben Affleck. Although the rest of the cast is superb and the story itself is a gripping one, Affleck is clearly coming into his own as a multi-talented movie maker. As far as I'm concerned, The Town is must see viewing.

POLITICAL NOTES: Surprisingly (especially given the FBI's extensive involvement in the storyline) none.

FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Town is rated R for ""strong violence, pervasive language, some sexuality and drug use,"" and it should be. It is in no way suitable for children or younger teens (who probably won't like it anyway). But for mature teens and adults, The Town offers a rare movie-going experience: An extraordinarily well made and intelligent film that also offers an exciting two hours in the theatre.",9
19 February 2022,Good Thriller With An Excellent Sense Of Community And Place,"Like another Ben Affleck directed thriller, Gone Baby Gone, this really nicely evokes the sense of place and community around the Boston area. This is no convenient backdrop - it's tangible and integral to the story. It doesn't quite have the other film's weight, but it certainly moves as much as it grips.

13 September 2010,Ben Affleck CAN direct,"Ben Affleck has proved he is good at directing movies. That's not to say this was a mindblowing movie, it was a very competent, well acted, well directed movie with some humor at moments and some intense action sequences.

The movie follows Doug MacRay, a bank robber who pursues a woman he and his crew had just abducted to try and befriend her. Relationships get complicated and the usual drama follows. Ben Affleck can be surprisingly affecting in his roles - he is a rather likable character despite being a crook. His other crew are not so memorable - Jeremy Renner is an interesting portrait, but not something we have not seen before. He is the typical bad ass who eventually steps beyond his bounds. Honestly, I don't even remember or care about the other two guys.

The woman, played by Rebecca Hall, does a solid job as Claire Keesey. We see her hardships, her torment and anguish (albeit a bit too much). The chemistry between her and Affleck is not really there, but hey, it's basically an action movie. Blake Lively seems out of place as MacRay's former lover. Jon Hamm plays a standard role as the hard driving cop who will stop at nothing. And Affleck's bosses are funny but not really memorable.

Affleck also directed The Town, and he seem to has a thing for the action camera. Most action sequences are fast paced and suspenseful (though EVERY bank heist reminds me of The Dark Knight, but that's just my geeky self). A problem I had with the heists was similar to what a friend pointed out: the robbers prepared hardcore for each heist, with huge guns and armor. My question is: why? Heists are supposed to be quiet, usually, and guns are used for crowd control and backup. EVERY heist in this movie went a little bit wrong. These crooks are either real amateurs or they suck at their jobs.

The plot was stretched a bit thin, and some of the motivations of the characters baffled me a bit. Some things were just unclear with the characters, and a lot of loose ends were not tied up. However, it's not really a big deal to me, as I enjoyed watching it and I took it for what it was: an action film with a little heart.

I saw this at a free screening: I'm not sure if I'd pay to see it. It's pretty standard fare; however, it's rather well-directed standard fare, if that makes any sense.

13 August 2012,Pure Cinematic Gold.,"THE TOWN is a great heist film by Ben Affleck. Affleck starts out by laying out some basic facts here which sets up the movie nicely. It States that Charlestown has created more bank robbers and armed robbers then anywhere else.

The beginning starts off with Doug McRay going over the plans to rob a bank. When they break into the bank as soon as it opens Doug and his partners force the bank manager a lovely young lady named Claire to open the safe. Claire does so and as they leave someone trips the silent alarm earning a Teller a horrible beating which Claire witnesses. She Sees a tattoo on the back of the man's neck and keeps it to herself. The Gang take her hostage. To guarantee their safety. They blindfold her and take her driver's licence. They inform her that someone will hold onto it and will watch her in case she tries to talk to the F.B.I or the Cops.

Doug doesn't like how the gang treated her and takes the licence. What begins as a simple job of watching her becomes complex when Doug falls in love with her. Claire falls in love with him and Doug gets pulled into another Job. Against his will and better judgement. Doug takes the Job. Warning them that if anything goes wrong he warned them. The Job goes badly and they almost get caught. By now the F.B.i have a interest in Doug and his partners. Doug alarmed by how close they came to getting caught Swears this was his last job. Until the neighbourhood Mob Boss Fergie the Florist gets them a job that'll put them into the big time. Doug wants out but Fergie has other plans and Doug knows he's backed into a corner. Fergie threatens Claire and to keep her safe Doug takes the job. Meanwhile the F.B.I inform Claire that Doug was one of the robbers and suddenly the world changes for both of them. The Last job goes wrong and Doug is now on the run trying to get to Claire.

The Town has it's flaws. But it flows smoothly enough. The Acting is very good and draws you in. The Story could be considered Clichéd. But Affleck puts enough fresh touches to it to make it feel new. The film succeeds in what it sets out to do. Entertain you. Ben Affleck shows off the talent he showed back in Good Will Hunting. He can write. We knew that. Now we find out he can direct. And THE TOWN. is proof of that.",10
29 March 2014,"Ben Affleck's ""The Town""-so bad that it's good:","""The Town"" is an overrated, hyped-up, cheesy piece of junk, imo. It's more like a feature- length, made-for-TV soap opera than a regular movie, and is very cartoonlike with a poor to mediocre cast. None of the characters are believable except for Jeremy Renner's role as the crazy ""Jem"" Coughlin, and Jon Hamm as Adam Frawley, the FBI Agt. who's been assigned to bring Doug MacRay and his men to their knees and to prison, once and for all.

The beginning of ""The Town"", with the opening bank heist and the aerial/on the ground shots of Charlestown and Boston, generally, was interesting, but it went from being okay to being just plain awful in a matter of minutes.

The Town conveys the message to me, personally, that people don't have to be held accountable for what they do, and, as long as they get what they want, anything goes. A strong message that predatory behavior such as stalking a person, and associating with a person who shoots, kills and beats people within inches of their life is okay is also evident in The Town.

So is the message that a woman who's very princess-like, demure and ""normal"" and steals the heart of the de-facto leader of a local gang of thieving thugs can be petted and praised as a good lass, regardless of what she does, and that being an accessory to someone's criminal activity and making dupes out of law enforcement people who are trying to do their assigned jobs of bringing criminals to justice is okay.

The Town also indicates the continued ""dumbing down"" of America and the world; the fact that such a film not only can be mad, but to have such glowing reviews from most people is a strong reflection of that.",1
5 December 2010,"The Town is a great, edge of the seat thrilling, emotional and memorable ride.","THE TWON – CATCH IT ( A ) Wow Ben Affleck directed another exceptional good movie after ""Gone Baby Gone"". From the first scene till the end, The Town keeps you on the edge of your seat. The thrill, excitement, fear, aggression and emotions are well presented in the movie. Boston car chase scene and the ending was captivating, I was literally holding my breath the whole time. Ben Affleck, after a really long time shine on the screen not only as director but as an actor too. Jeremy Runner gave a brave performance after ""The Hurt Locker"", he truly kept me captivated and though he is playing a Bad Guy, you still feel bad in the End for him! Rebecca Hall was the emotion and love in the movie, I think standing up next to Jeremy Renner & Ben Affleck is in itself an achievement. Blake Lively, I'm a huge Gossip Girl fan and initially its hard for me to take her out from her Glam Doll Serena Van Der Woodson Avatar but soon she just rip off that image with her Southern Boston Dirty body language. Though, she didn't have much scope in the movie but still she gave power house performance in her role. Jon Hamm did a good job along side Owen Burke, Slaine and Chris Cooper. Overall The Town is a great, edge of the seat thrilling, emotional and memorable ride. One of the best movie about Bank Robbers. Must Watch it!",9

In terms of the plot, there was a lot more action involved than I thought and I really enjoyed the inter twining of the relationship and his crimes. It's just a really good story that puts the audience through the paces and it had me on the edge of my seat.

Only negative really is that I thought it didn't need to be as long as it was. But it took nothing away from the film itself. Great watch and really took me by surprise. 8/10.

24 October 2010,A Nutshell Review: The Town,"The question on everyone's mind is whether Ben Affleck makes a better actor or a director? The Town is his second directorial effort after his excellent Gone Baby Gone, and in this one he also puts himself in front of the camera leading an ensemble cast which includes the likes of Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner, Blake Lively, Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite. Quite the power-packed cast in a riveting drama about a gang of robbers with three superbly shot action sequences that are as violent as they are vividly real.

I'm tied with this one, because Ben Affleck shows he's just as good as he is behind the camera as he is in front, delivery what I felt was one of his best performances undoubtedly lifted by playing off the wealth of talent at his disposal, that he had to up his game, and came through rather successfully. There's only a handful of contemporary films about bank robbers that stick and become memorable, in my books being Katherine Bigelow's Point Break and Michael Mann's Heat, and joining that small list will be The Town, with its high drama and high octane action sequences, both aspects not overshadowing each other, but complementing the entire narrative experience.

The titular town referred to is Charlestown, Boston, reputed to be armed robbery capital of the world, where this tale zooms in on the quartet of robbers James Coughlin (Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke), led by de-facto general Doug MacRay (Affleck) who take their orders, direction and opportunities from another local gangster Fergus Colm (Postlethwaite) who fronts his shady background with a legitimate florist business. The film opens with a daring bank robbery where the team take Claire (Hall) the assistant manager hostage, only for Doug to unexpectedly fall in love with her and vice versa in time to come with what would be a twisted variation of the Stockholm Syndrome.

Based upon the book Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan, The Town has plenty of rich subplots such as the unquestionable yet unspoken love between the MacRay father (Chris Cooper) and son and the mystery behind the disappearance of their wife/mother, the camaraderie, brotherhood and loyalty issues between the robbers especially that between James and Doug since the latter has relations with the former's sister (Blake Lively) who demonstrates the extent of a woman scorned, and the biggest story here will be the love story between Doug and Claire, which propels much of the narrative since it plants a thought with Doug to deem it time to quit a life of crime.

I suppose a budding love life that potentially promises a lot more hope than one Doug is currently in, will make him think twice if it's time to go back on the path of righteousness. But like all gangsters, going down that right path always prove to be difficult, as the beneficiaries of his and his gang's exploits will want anything but their cash cow to stop producing milk. Threats get set up and we're left riveted in witnessing just how the largest scale heist the team had ever executed get underway. It's one thing wanting out, but another in being sucked right back in because of circumstances.

While I couldn't care too much about the romance between Doug and Claire which is hinged on dishonesty and secrets, it is the action sequences that made this film stand out. Unlike Takers which had over the top action and an infighting central to its theme, The Town boasts more violently realistic battle sequences between cops and robbers, and although only a handful of them, each are just as memorable and builds up in tension and adrenaline from the last, each with a little bit of throwback to Heat because of its gunfights down busy streets where countless of rounds from automatic weapons get randomly sprayed around, with really ugly outcomes. It doesn't glamourize violence, but shows it as is.

And Jeremy Renner once again stands out in the film as the highly volatile gangster who dishes out punishment without remorse, and his performance here is excellent par none. Besides Affleck's competent direction in pulling this film off, Renner is the live wire here that sets the film ticking, and I will for one be keen to follow what he does as a follow up to this, as with what Ben Affleck will be directing next. One of the best crime thrillers seen this year, so do yourself a favour not to miss this in cinemas right now.",8
21 November 2021,A Crime Story With An Excellent Cast,"An interesting crime story with an excellent cast.

In the film, we follow a group of robbers of different characters with a complicated past. When they are forced to take over and carry out a risky robbery things go wrong. On their trail is an FBI agent played by Jon Hamm.

Ben Affleck has proven to be a good director who knows how to tell a story when he has a good screenplay. The cast portrayed the characters excellently, Jeremy Renner being particularly interesting in the role of James Coughlin.

The film is well directed, with interesting and tense action scenes.

The story itself is interesting, and Ben Affleck superbly conveyed the script to the big screen. After seeing all three versions of the film, I liked the extended cut the most. But no version of the film is bad, each has its value.

The characters are interesting, the direction and cinematography are good, and the cast is excellent. The environment in which the story takes place is interesting, and the characters are well developed.

The characters are definitely the greatest strength of the film, and the excellent casting only enhanced the impression of the whole film. It reminded me of old-fashioned crime stories, with interesting and complicated characters, with sometimes tragic fates.

An interesting and entertaining crime story worth watching.",8
27 September 2010,not a fan boys and girls,"its not that good, really is it? the storyline was weak and almost nonsensical, given the amount of robberies they do during the film and the amount they have done in their whole lives. the acting was not that great apart from the hard ex-con who is Aflecks best mate (the guy from hurt locker). the romance element didn't work because Afleck and his chick didn't have ANY chemistry.

The action sequences were the biggest talking point but having recently watched inception they were no big deal. also i don't want to ruin it but that was one hell of a cliché, annoying ending if you ask me. Afleck directs this distinctly average film, and something tells me the action sequences were done by somebody else.

A generous four out of ten. can anybody explain why this gets such good reviews and has 8.3 out of ten?? you lot been smoking some righteous weed

24 September 2010,The Restoration of Ben Affleck.,"More often than not, an actor in Hollywood will experience severe disability in terms of being able to choose scripts and quality movies. Ben Affleck has suffered from such a problem, taking the easy road during the middle period of his career in such clunkers as Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and Gigli. Yet, he has begun a turnaround with a solid role in Hollywoodland and his directing debut in the vastly underrated Gone Baby Gone. Now he's at it again, taking the same type of material he used in that 2007 film and focusing on the nature of bank robberies in a small suburb of Boston.

In stretching his limits and going beyond his previous work, Affleck takes on the role of director, co-writer and lead actor here and does great work in all three. His acting has been criticized in the past for his lack of toughness and seemingly automatic ability to cry. Yet, here, he holds back much of the melodramatic emotion and lets his expressive face do more of the acting. For that reason alone, he gives perhaps his best performance. It also helps that he's working with great actors here; Jeremy Renner gives another memorable performance as a trigger-happy childhood friend of Affleck's willing to go to any length in a robbery to provide for his family. Jon Hamm is solid as the FBI agent right on the robbers' trail and Rebecca Hall deserves more buzz than she will get for this role as Claire, a bank manager taken hostage by Affleck's crew only to start a relationship with him.

My main problem with this film was the casting of Blake Lively as Renner's younger sister, Krista, a single mother drug dealer and former lover of Affleck's. Lively, as beautiful as she is, gives a very melodramatic and seemingly amateurish performance; at times she is barely discernible. In truth, she is out of depth with nearly all these actors and comparing her to Hall just blows her out of the water. Still, the great Chris Cooper comes to save the day in just one powerful scene as Affleck's father. Perhaps the key scene, it explores family memories, regret and motivation all at the same time. It is scenes like this that prove Affleck's growing ability as a director.

As for the film overall, it's very good but not great. I would hesitate to call it one of the best of 2010 only because we've seen this story before in better films like The Departed. Still, the quiet scenes are moving and poignant, the action sequences are startlingly violent and gripping and the final scene is one of great nostalgia and emotional depth. The most gratifying thing to come out of The Town is the fact that Ben Affleck is back in a big way. This film and Gone Baby Gone prove he's no longer that arrogant punk in Gigli or Pearl Harbor. Here, he's a man proved, tough and worthy. I certainly look forward to his next work as a director; his future is bright in all aspects.",8
14 April 2017,One of Ben Affleck's best movies,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",9
9 February 2021,I Don't Understand The Great Reviews,"The premise is good but the execution is not. The production is top class but the script has holes and putting Ben Affleck in a hoody doesn't make him 'street' by any stretch of the imagination.

I didn't feel anything for any of the characters and that is a must if it is meant to be 'bad guy wants to be good'. Some sympathy, some empathy, some emotional engagement - nothing.

Affleck might look good but he can't act and that wasn't helped by a script that didn't give him an opportunity to show any emotions. That might have been a point of the film - guy brought up in rough neighbourhood doesn't show emotions - but that wasn't portrayed to let us feel his emotional detachment.

As for the cops and the police procedural element of the movie, a teenager could have written a better story and more believable characters.

This got made because the producers thought Affleck was/is bankable, but the fact I have never heard of this movie 11 years after it was made (I watch a lot of films and read reviews) tells me I should have left it alone.",4

14 September 2010,Ben Affleck -- Great job all around!,"Went to a sneak preview of this movie last night. And I came out of the theater exhausted from the tension of caring about the people in this movie. Ben Affleck was one of the screenwriters, the director and the star and he did a great job in all three jobs. Jeremy Renner was so enthralling to watch -- he was a tightly wound fist of energy, frustration, anger and violence. Jon Hamm was the FBI good guy and did as good a job as any. Blake Lively surprised me with what I never would have guessed was true acting chops. And Ben deserves every accolade. This is not a movie for people who cringe at the F-bomb, or violence, or two really hot sex scenes. Definitely not for young people. But a thrill ride that will wear you out! Go see it!

21 August 2012,East Coast Bank Robbery at its finest,"A movie featuring Ben Affleck without his real life bromance partner Matt Damon in the mix is usually an easy way to sink a film. This time it is anything but a disappointment. True, The romance side of the story is interesting but really could have been cut out all together. ""The Town,"" is a movie that Ben Affleck can be proud of, and is a good direction for his fizzling acting career. Also showing great performances are Jeremy Renner, and Blake Lively. Anyone who likes movies about bank heists, crime drama, and mob connection movies will delight in this movie that successfully incorporates moments of an action thriller and intelligent drama.

As I said before, the romance portion of the movie is the only real downside and the movie could have stood alone without it, but it doesn't destroy this movie either. Jeremy Renner probably outshines Affleck, but he does bring out a better performance in Affleck, who let's face it, is just a little eye candy to bring women into a guy's movie.

""The Town,"" delivers as a crime drama with plenty of action even if you are biased against pretty boy Ben Affleck and is a do not miss if you want to watch a smart, well executed heist movie.",9

31 October 2010,Sunny days in Boston,"Charlestown is the bank robbery capitol of America. The trade is passed down from father to son. Doug wants out. He's good at it, but he wants a chance at a proper life. That is no easy task; there are people who don't want him to quit, including childhood friend Jem(a volatile man, played to perfection by Jeremy Renner) who does jobs with him, and the crime lord The Florist(Pete Postlethwaite who is never seen without flowers near him, and yet he truly inspires dread... that takes serious stones). Things are complicated when he falls for the hostage(that white chick from Vicky Christina Barcelona who wasn't Scarlett Johansson) they took on the most recent heist, and the FBI begin to track them down. Right from the get-go, this grips you. The story moves along at a very good pace, giving you room to breathe after a scene of tension(frankly, it gets so thick, you'll be walking out of the theater with a friggin' ulcer), the character development has you caring whenever something big happens, and the acting(Cooper makes an impact with a tiny amount of screen-time) is great for all concerned(best ensemble cast I've seen in the last few years). Yes, Affleck himself does well(and is charming), as he can when he is at his best in that field... and his direction is something you should *not* miss(and hey, maybe he'll eventually branch out to dealing with plots that don't have any kidnappings in them... just kidding). He handles all the elements beautifully. The twists hit you like blows to the gut. This is filmed and edited incredibly well. The brutal violence(of which there is a ton) is all in close-up and often with hand-held cameras, and this makes it immensely effective. And the way this uses cuts to silence or to seemingly uneventful images in the sequence is evidence of considerable skill. It hits the balance impossibly well, and we truly get a compelling experience at the theater, where the emotion feels genuine and it really stays with you after you leave. The bits where we see the gang engage in their craft are intense and swift, with many of tiny details that really hammer home how professional these people are. It makes the inevitable confrontation between them and the police all the more grand. The shootouts have a Michael Mann quality to them. Authenticity, realism and a real sense that any of the bullets could prove fatal. The dialog is clever and well-delivered, and though it comes close to being ""overwritten"" at times, it always works... oh, and brush up on slang or bring a dictionary or something... I'm grateful there were subtitles. Oh, and I'm not qualified to judge the accents... I can say that several people go for it. This has an appropriate amount of humor in this, and without anything losing its seriousness. There is a lot of strong language, a little sexuality and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it. 8/10",8
30 December 2010,Crime in the City,"The story as it is, did not offer me anything new. Nor was there any very clever writing, that I could spot. But it's still more than a decent effort by the makers. They chose the actors carefully and the location even more so. Sometimes the location can become a character itself and that is the case here. Even while I haven't been there myself, I can feel the weight of the town.

Predictable it may be, not really having a big story or anything quite great to say either, this thriller will entertain you. If you let it that is. The flaws are there and very apparent. But I didn't feel that they were as big, as to actually driving the entertainment value of the movie down. You might feel differently of course, but try to enjoy it if you can.

1 November 2010,"The Town is a mature and intelligent thriller, layered with subtext relating to crime cultures developed and extended through family ties","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston.

It is a bit like ""Heats"" (a similar and much better movie made in 1995 starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino) little brother. The pace---the guns the taking down of scores. Affleck should look for a tale which is totally different...this type of movie has been done (better) many times before. What about a remake of the Wizard of Oz ??. Or Tarzan and the Chocolate Factory ??.

5 October 2010,Actors and film could use a shave in this cops and robbers fairy tale.,"Director Ben Affleck displays a much better grasp of storytelling and film grammar in his second time (the belabored Gone Baby Gone) out as director but his overbearing le petit Marlon Brando lead eats up too much celluloid and The Town loses its grip not far from the finish line before convulsing in mawkish sentimentality as it takes incredulity and perverse optimism into another stratosphere.

Doug MacRae and his gang are an efficient quartet of armored car and bank robbers operating out of Charlestown MA. He foolishly becomes involved with a bank employee in one of his robberies and this sets off all sorts of alarms for the gang and the FBI. Mercifully in between we are treated to some hair raising chases and shootouts climaxing at Fenway Park.

Afflecks cloying Doug is all moody torpor and the sadness of his childhood and newly uncovered information about it are met with dumbfounded and inexpressive stares. It's embarrassing Brando in need of a shave. Also in need of some facial landscaping is FBI pursuer Adam Frawley played by Jon Hamm with a refreshing touch of sadism. As Mac Crae's trigger happy sidekick Coughlin, Jeremy Renner is Cagney 2000 and the worse for it. Peter Postlewaite as a Whitey Bulger like florist walks away with acting honors. Better to watch two hours of an ugly grand actor emote than the flat handsomely chiseled features of the melancholy Townie Affleck who has as much range as Ahab at short.

Director Affleck does have a good eye for capturing the congested New England Town of Charlestown as well as Boston and his chase scenes really screech with suspense but the weight he accords the unreality of the films romantic aspects puts the breaks on The Town allowing it to advance no further as this self indulgent noir has a head on collision with a fairy tale ending that fades to a folk song over credits.

This is the second example of more is worse in The Friends of Eddie Coyle wanna be stakes. First there was the bloated The Departed with a roster of Easter hams and regurgitations of Scorcese violence and now this slick looking slam bang / implausible romancer.

The minor masterpiece Coyle choked with realism and an unromantic mood of taedium vitae that today's cool and Affleck's incurable romanticism just won't allow. It may look and taste good but that's because its filled with sugar.",5
29 December 2010,Are movie standards this low nowadays?,"Bad directing, bad acting, full of holes and stolen from other movies.

I really thought the movie would be fun to watch, i like a good action/thriller movie. A friend and i watched the movie and wanted to stop watching for a couple of times. The dialogues were so easy to follow that sometimes we both said what the actor should say in response and he did ! The movies jumps from here to there without preparing the viewer. It was like a timed action movie, action for 5 minutes then some character scenes and just as you start to fall asleep some action and that just keeps going on through the whole movie, boring . .

Oh my god, Ben, what is wrong with your accent? I guess people from Boston talk with an accent, there is nothing wrong with that but it seems that where all the other actors just try to concentrate on acting with Renner doing a superb job Ben tries to show how good his accent is and fails miserably because of him trying to much, that's his problem in this movie, he tries so hard to be not only a good actor but also a good director that he fails in doing both.

All in all i would say it's a waste of time, watch the ones he stole the ideas from instead. Point Break, Heat.

I give it three stars for some of the action bits, some, and Renner.",3

28 October 2010,"Affleck's return to home ground is a character-driven heist thriller that brims with excellent performances, gripping drama and intense action","Ben Affleck returns to his native Boston for his sophomore directorial effort, ""The Town"", a tense and thrilling heist movie that, as many reviewers have already pointed out, establishes Affleck as a director to be reckoned with. Whereas his previous ""Gone Baby Gone"" was a character drama smaller in scope and dramatic intensity, Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"" on which this movie is based offers potential for both intense action and gripping drama- and Affleck delivers on both counts.

The film's opening title card informs of the location of the story- Charlestown- that is very much a character in the movie in its own right. Here we are told, is a neighbourhood that has produced more bank robbers than any other, a bank robbery capitol of the United States, and a place where criminal livelihoods are handed down from father to son. Such is the case of Doug MacRay (Affleck), the smart leader of a gang of vicious and notoriously successful robbers, whose father (Chris Cooper in a brief but terrific cameo) is behind bars.

Doug and his buddies- most notably his hot-headed trigger-happy childhood friend Jim (Jeremy Renner)- are through and through products of their environment and they know no livelihood outside their lives of crime. One particular job (the film's brutally efficient opening sequence) leaves Doug questioning if he's ready to call it quits and start anew. Unlike Jim, there is genuine humanity in Doug, and it is this humanity that causes him to reach out and take bank manager Claire's hand (Rebecca Hall) to calm her down when she is too terrified to open the vault, to intervene later when Jim threatens to kill Claire and to finally establish a personal heartfelt connection with her.

The subsequent relationship between Doug and Claire is the heart of this morality tale and kudos to Affleck for handling it with much finesse. Indeed, it is to Affleck's credit as a director that their budding romance develops convincingly without any over-sentimentalising. It is also to Affleck's credit as an actor that he is able to keenly illuminate through this unlikely relationship the inner struggles his character Doug is going through. Affleck too shares a lovely chemistry with Hall, his brooding intensity complementing Hall's refreshing simplicity.

Almost two-thirds of the movie is spent carefully delineating Doug's attempt at a redemptive change in his life and the effect of the various characters in his life. With Claire represents the only upshot at this change, Doug has to contend with the borderline psychotic Jim, the local crime kingpin Fergie Colm (Pete Postlethwaite) and a zealous FBI agent (Mad Men's Jon Hamm) fast on his tail. Affleck does a fair job balancing these disparate plot threads, though, compared to the book, parts like Doug's poisonous past with Jim's sister and single mom Krista (Blake Lively) as well as Doug's other partners in crime are given particularly short shrift.

Still, Affleck has done marvellously at translating the atmosphere of the book to the big screen. That shouldn't come as a surprise to those who have seen his earlier ""Gone Baby Gone"", but interviews have revealed his depth of research into the blue-collar criminal subculture of Charlestown and it shows in the movie's distinct sense of authenticity. He has also coaxed wonderfully authentic performances out of his ensemble cast- in particular Jeremy Renner's dangerously menacing portrait of Jim- and the strong acting here from each and every one of his actors effectively keeps you engrossed throughout.

Affleck reserves most of the action for the last third of the movie, which crackles along at a sizzling pace. An exciting car chase sequence aside, the highlight of the high-octane action is most certainly the climactic shootout at Fenway Park, one of Boston's iconic landmarks. Affleck doesn't rush the action, building it slowly but surely, letting the intensity grow, and finally lets it out in a thrilling showdown between the Feds and Doug and his crew. By then, the investment Affleck has made in developing his characters pays off nicely, as you'll find that the movie's finish turns out unexpectedly poignant.

Of course, Affleck's gift as a director in crafting complex character dramas was already apparent in ""Gone Baby Gone"" but his accomplishment here further reinforces his abilities in this regard. It also reveals a fresh side in Affleck's directorial skill as an orchestrator of gripping action sequences attested by the brilliantly executed heists and car chases. Though it isn't as accomplished as Michael Mann's ""Heat"" or Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed"", Ben Affleck's ""The Town"" is a perfectly entertaining heist drama in its own right and is most definitely a glowing addition to his fortunes as a director.",8
20 January 2011,"Accomplished, But Also Slow and Talky","""The Town"" showcases Ben Affleck's potential as a director, but it also highlights the qualities about his style that have so far prevented that potential from fully blossoming.

Set in the dreariest, gloomiest parts of Boston, much like his directorial debut ""Gone, Baby Gone,"" ""The Town"" is a moody character study disguised as a heist film. The authentic feel and raw edges Affleck brings to his story go a long way toward masking the fact that it's full of pure movie cliché. A sensitive criminal (played by Affleck himself) becomes conflicted and dreams of starting a new life once he begins to receive the love of a good woman (Rebecca Hall, lovely as always but stuck with a somewhat thankless role). Affleck seems to have gone to the Clint Eastwood school of filmmaking, where everything -- both in the actual physical production and its tone -- must be gray and drab and ponderously ""important."" It's a slow and talky movie, and I found myself wishing Affleck would just get on with things already. I didn't dislike it, but I did find that my opinion of it began to gradually sink after I'd let the memory of it settle in my mind for a few days after watching it.

Affleck clearly wants to be taken seriously as a Filmmaker with a capital ""F,"" but he needs to remember that the best filmmakers manage to make movies that are both important and entertaining.

Grade: B",7
24 September 2010,Best movie of the year so far for me,"Ben Affleck has hit full stride with this taut, scary crime thriller. All aspects ring so true, from the superb caper planning and preparation to the actual caper timing and interactions with victims to after the caper is done and the money is in hand and causing all kinds of divisive thoughts and actions. The ensemble acting was uniquely superb overall, and that shows so true that Ben conveyed exactly what he wanted from the cast, the surest sign of a great director, and a resulting great film.

The best lesson to be learned from this terrific film, if one is learned, is that abjectly insular upbringings such as those shown in the Irish Charlestown section of Boston, are almost totally determining of most people's eventual fate if a fierce and unshakable attitude is not taken to get out and thus eliminate those strait-jacket forces holding one back from liberating self-improvement. That it is exactly the same in Harlem, East L.A, or Bensonhurst is proof positive of its eventual destructive nature. The same can be said of a religious or drunken or drugged or parentally self-absorbed household/community or any other form of severely constricting environment. One must get out forever to fully realize one's true self and destiny.

This film was much more to me than a crime caper. It was a crucial human lesson in how to correct an unfortunate circumstance of birth, that of being forced into a restrictive corner in life due to being born in a certain place. When that happens, everyone must do as Ben did in this story..........work your a$$ off to get out no matter what it costs temporarily. It will pay off in the end much more than any caper ever could, and that is what I thought was the most important message in this terrific film.",9
30 September 2011,Mind blowing movie,"I really had high expectations for this movie. I never would have even seen it if I hadn't already seen Gone Baby Gone (which Affleck also directed) and it was a great film. But he did even better than I had hoped for. Not only was the action intense, but the story was great. I'm not crazy about Ben Affleck as an actor, but the man can direct. And he did a decent job of acting in this movie. But the real surprise was Jeremy Renner. I'm glad he is getting some good jobs. The Hurt Locker was great and wouldn't have been the same without him. I really was impressed with this movie. By far the best bank heist movie I've ever seen. I mean the heist at the beginning of The Dark Knight was awesome, and I love Dog Day Afternoon. But this managed to keep your attention from the start and didn't let up for over two hours. Very few films of any kind can do that. Bravo to Ben Affleck and everyone involved with this movie. Should have been nominated for several Academy Awards. If you haven't seen it, go watch it now. Heck, buy it, you won't be disappointed.

18 January 2019,"A ""Heat"" -like Crime Thriller","26 September 2010. With strong parallels to HEAT (1995), THE TOWN however focuses more on the singular perspective of the criminals and an extended focus on the relational significance of the movie. THE TOWN also has scenes suggestive from Matt Damon's BOURNE IDENTITY series and has some suggestive associations with Affleck's and Damon's GOOD WILL HUNTING, with Affleck getting his turn to shine in more ways the one by the end. What makes this movie seem to work is both its weakness and strength having to sensationalize and dramatize what is unlikely to be real police shootouts or bank robberies, yet the detailed stylish manner in which this movie is shot, particularly the action scenes are powerful and resonate with more authenticity because of the apparent and well done quick edits. The chases scenes while avoiding the typical cheap choreographed traffic set up, also is both better in terms of the in your face experience, yet also lazy in terms of the lack of continuity (much like how Olympic down hill or slalom television coverage is obtained with periodic cut away shots with some of the continuous experience cut out. One irritating weak point is the unclear specifics in how (not by who) the FBI is apprised of one of the specific crimes is going down. The emotional connections between crime partners, the risky over the top use of a hardened criminal with a murder mentality is also too much while the delicate balance of Ben Affleck's character is both good and bad, especially in how he ends up dealing with ""women."" Are there really good and bad criminals in this movie or more a shade of gray here? In one pretty impressive climax sequences, the ending series of scenes almost turns into a BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, nevertheless, the movie is able to pull of one better. This movie understands how to push the audience buttons, making members feel involved in being upset, anxious, fearful, and anticipatory for the outcome. Overall, a superior, decent crime thriller that ranks along side HEAT.",8
4 January 2013,Really Great and Complex,"The Town refers to Charlestown, Massachusetts; a poor Irish neighborhood on the outskirts of Boston - its claim to fame, spawning more bank robbers than any place else in America. Doug MacRay (Affleck) and Jem (Jeremy Renner) are the new robbery kings in Boston; childhood friends who grew up in criminal families, they run an elite heist crew for the local crime boss and florist, Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite). Their string of flawless robberies runs into a hitch when Jem kidnaps a beautiful bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall). They release her. But soon come to realize she lives four blocks away from them and is talking to the FBI (John Hamm). Doug's decision to check her out leads to a foolish and dangerous romance. She awakens in him the desire for a life without crime and violence, but Doug's world is not one you can simply walk away from.

What makes The Town so interesting is the authenticity of the characters. Affleck has stuck to what he knows in his previous films and takes that to a pinnacle here. The neighborhood, its people, they are so genuine. I didn't recognize Blake Lively as Jem's drug-addicted, single mother sister. The accents, the dialogue, swagger, it's as real as it gets. So when the character conflicts begin to emerge, the doomsday events that unfold have weight to the audience. This is a fine ensemble cast, but the specificity of the performances seems like marionette strings being pulled by Affleck. As the lead actor and director, you can see him shaping these performances into precise delivery on screen.

The action scenes are slick and well paced, but not set up to add a bang to the script every ten pages. These are criminal acts for money, dangerous activities driven by a ruthless man. You'd have to be crazy to attempt any of this stuff. This point is hammered in. Doug has lived on the edge of the knife for so long, resigned himself to the fate of a criminal, that when Claire opens up the possibility for a different life; it is truly an epiphany. It's easy to have a death wish when there's nothing to live for.",9
18 December 2012,Ben Affleck's directorial win,"The Town is a deliberately old-fashioned, pulpy crime drama that serves its purpose as a romantic heist picture, where character-driven narrative intertwines with many action-packed sequences of utmost suspense. With this film Ben Affleck surely hit a second spectacular home run (right after Gone Baby Gone), assuring that his directorial career will be more rewarding than his acting one.

What's surprising is that the story depicted in The Town comes as a rather familiar and simple one, but the way it's presented and acted promises many splendidly entertaining and downright thrilling moments. Right within the first few minutes of the picture the tension mounts to unbearable levels, as a group of masked criminals robs a bank and takes one of the female workers as a hostage. The woman, Claire (Rebecca Hall), quickly becomes the object of interest of the mastermind behind the heist, Doug (Ben Affleck in his most promising role to date). Yet still unknown to her is the fact that Doug was actually the one, who commanded the operation and caused the whole mess. As the two begin their burning love affair, Doug - along with his three partners in crime - plan another dangerous robberies. His sudden affection towards the girl and gradual loss of readiness to go into action makes his partner anxious and relevantly angry. Jem (Jeremy Renner; the guy really had a good few years), his longtime friend and former jailbird is trying to convince him that money is worth more than a girl. Apart from the personal conflicts, Doug is followed closely by a FBI operative Frawley (Jon Hamm), who is eager to put the guys behind bars and stop the Charlestown criminal ring once and for all. Because, after all, it's a business of relationships, and what happens in the family stays in the family. Doug walks a thin line between freedom and imprisonment, and this one final action might be all that he needs to finally take the matters of his life into his own hands.

Being a smartly written and captivatingly shot (many great aerial shots of Boston) thriller, The Town brings about all that's best about the genre, without referring to any clichés per se. Through combining its modern, violent crime nature with an appealing 30's vibe, The Town advises the audiences to look closely into the substance of the film and react to a many of the intense and gritty sensations that cleverly fill the core of the film. Every actor has a room to maneuver, and - decidedly so - each and every one of them finds a way to be a considerable part of the whole picture.",8
21 October 2010,A superbly made drama.,"With sophomore effort The Town, Ben Affleck has well and truly confirmed that he's a directorial force to be reckoned with and that his astounding Gone Baby Gone was no fluke. He handles the story, location and characters – all of which are unglamorous – with a deep affection and sincerity. These issues, places and people clearly mean something to him and consequently, through his earnestness in portraying them stripped of any falsities, they mean something to us. We shouldn't care about these bottom-feeding members of a criminally abundant community but Affleck – who also wrote the screenplay – sees to it that we look past face value, at least for a little while, to ascertain whether our initial judgments were in fact correct.

With the help of DP Robert Elswit – who gives the streets of Boston a dim, shadowy look – Affleck generates an ideal atmosphere for his characters to inhabit. His shots allow as much of the city in the frame as possible to emphasise the world, that is rife with potential, passing these people by. Contrastingly the action scenes are filmed with an immediate and claustrophobic feel primarily from the robbers' point-of-view, underlining the urgency of the situation they find themselves in and the lack of options they have once the first bullet is fired. With three heart pounding, brilliantly staged set-pieces – two that bookend the film and one at the halfway point – Affleck leaves no doubt that he can do tense action when required.

To round out his involvement, Affleck also takes on the lead role of Doug MacRay, a man who desperately wants to ameliorate his life but isn't sure how to go about it. He turns in a career-best performance that, along with his impressive work in last year's State of Play, may just be the birth of a comeback he's long needed. Elsewhere, a myriad of on-the-cusp-of-A-list-stardom actors put the icing on the cake. Academy award nominee Renner (The Hurt Locker) is both scary and sad as the quietly explosive Jem, British actress Hall (The Prestige) invests her distressed bank manager with a touching vulnerability, Gossip Girl Lively excels in her first serious acting gig as Doug's drug-addicted former flame and Mad Men's Hamm announces his arrival to the big screen with an impactful turn as the uncompromising G-man.

A superbly made, gritty drama that stamps Affleck as a director to watch in the future.

4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",9
18 December 2010,"A Fine, Smart, Well Made Drama","THE TOWN, the title refers to Charlestown, a section of Boston infamous for the crime and criminals who hail from that area, and Director, Actor, and Co-Writer (with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) Ben Affleck knows this area well as is evident in not only the accents of all of his characters but also in the choices of locations for this fast moving bank heist drama. Affleck knows how to bring out the best in his cast of superb actors - never forgetting that despite the crusty surfaces of his people their lies beneath a bruised psyche.

Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) leads a gang of bank robbers - James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Gloansy Magloan (Slaine), Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) - carrying off a series of successful heists dressed in costumes to conceal their identity, laundering their stolen money at the guidance of florist Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) in a manner that eludes the police. During one of their heists they take a hostage, the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) whom they release after the heist. Knowing that she may inform the FBI Doug decides to makes friends with her but instead of assuring his fellow gang that she will not be a problem Doug instead falls for her. The FBI - Frawley (Jon Hamm) and Dino (Titus Welliver) - remain hot on the gang's trail, attempting to get information from Doug's old girlfriend Krista (Blake Lively, in a breakout performance!). Doug is conflicted and thinks of leaving the gang so that he won't end up like his father (Chris Cooper) who is in jail, but James is the baddie here and demands the gang stay together for at least one last major heist. A schism arises between Doug and Claire and uncovers a deep scar from Doug's past. From that point on through the end of the film the story is filled with conflicts, chases, the gang's outwitting the FBI and Boston police, all with the gang's penchant for changing disguises frequently. The ending is full of surprises.

Though not a great movie, THE TOWN is far better a film than many that are gaining award nominations. One of the reasons is the tight ensemble work by this surprisingly fine cast who together give us a slice of Boston we'll not forget. Well worth watching.

And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",4
18 May 2018,"Its action set-pieces are high-notes, but the overall effect is a weak and fairly forgettable one.","'The Town (2010)' is a thriller centred around a gang of bank robbers residing in the supposed 'breeding ground for armed robbers', Charlestown in Boston, Massachusetts. As is usual for most of Affleck's fare, and for most of the features set in that particular city, there is a distinct air of 'localism', highlighting a close-knit community with almost patriotic levels of commitment to one another. This sense of pride for a place is pushed hard, with the ground-level - and usually criminal - elements elevated to a pedestal even above the country - and, certainly, law of the land - in which they reside, almost like those jingoistic military flicks if they were to replace their flag with a back-yard barbecue. It is a strange choice, to put so much emphasis on the setting of the piece when it isn't even all that relevant to the story. Stranger still, is to feature TV-style sweeping shots of the skyline. Still, the handling of the environment is practically a trope for features set in the director's home-town at this point, so it's understandable why the choice was made. Demonising, or pseudo doing such, the FBI does feel like a missed opportunity, though. It feels generic at this point to make the 'good guys' bad by having them be general jerks, if they can't be outright corrupt (though it starts heading that way at one point), and makes for a less interesting feature. If the FBI guys were more nuanced, the flick could've played as a nice two-hander, a cat-and-mouse with conflicting sympathies on the part of the audience. As is, the audience is only meant to root for Affleck and company, whom are all 'bad guys' and don't do much to change our perception from that. Personally, I did empathise with the protagonist, but the other members of the crew aren't fleshed out enough to care for and some of their actions aren't ones you'd want to see go unpunished. In this way, we don't always root for our 'heroes' to get away with it, which means that the switching of the 'good and bad' has kind of failed. Arguably, this would make a more nuanced piece but nuance isn't being aimed for in this aspect. The feature is fairly slow, too. Its central romance feels doomed to fail, fleshed out only so that it can fall apart, and isn't gripping enough to be a main focus. It also isn't given all that much attention despite its time on-screen. The handling of character development is nice in some select scenes, but much of the 'masculinity gone awry' has been done better before. The action set-pieces are all fantastic, though. The finale, especially, is a taut and tense affair with frenetic violence escalating from some fairly suspenseful moments. It leaves you on a relatively high-note, despite a slow and stop-start ending - that's also very clichéd, and does make up for some of the less interesting segments. Still, the lasting impact of the piece is a quite weak and forgettable one. 6/10",6
6 December 2010,"A tense, and gripping crime thriller from start to finish. Ben Affleck is no one hit wonder.","Recently I got a chance to see Ben Affleck's latest crime drama, The Town, based on the book ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan.

In the film, Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a man in league with a band of bank robbers recruited by a threatening flower shop owner, and crime boss. After a recent heist involving taking a bank manager (Played by Rebbecca Hall) hostage, and later releasing her, Doug begins to charm her, and the two seem to hit it off well. However, complications arise from not only Doug's closest friend, Jem (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner), but he's also ceaselessly pursued by FBI agent Adam Frawley (Played by Jon Hamm), who will do any and all things possible to bring Doug to justice.

The movie is essentially two things: A) Proof that Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone was far from a fluke, and B) In my opinion, a better movie than Gone Baby Gone. His film is expertly structured, and set up, thanks to the efforts of he, and his co-writers Peter Craig, and Aaron Stockard. It can be a risky move to write, direct, and star in your own movie, but Affleck handles them all with adequate balance, and the result is a film that suffers from very few faults, most of which aren't even worth noting.

He really is making a comeback into the acting world, taking on a role perfect for him, and always taking it just as serious as is necessary, and shares great chemistry with Rebbecca Hall, who is also a great fit for her role. One of the more interesting mentions is Jeremy Renner, who leaves a lasting impression with his chilling, but quietly careful performance, and also worth mentioning is Jon Hamm, whose character is not quite afraid to embrace a subtle dark side of himself while trying to capture these criminals. Other fine examples of casting include small, but vital supporting roles by Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper.

It's expertly cast, and scripted, as well as handsomely crafted. The action scenes of the film are pretty nail-biting, fast paced, and well staged, specifically a very tense car chase through the narrow streets of Charlestown, complimented brilliantly by Robert Elswit's energetic cinematography, the highly involving sound mix by Gregg Landaker, Steve Maslow, and David J. Schwartz, as well as the brooding underscore by Harry Gregson-Williams and David Buckley.

It's a great film that's not only an engaging crime drama, but also a gripping action thriller.

And for that, The Town earns ***1/2 out of ****",9
10 January 2011,"Good flick, but kind of dated","This is one of those movies which were all the rave in the 70's, with idolized bank robbers that lived fast and hard. However, in 2010 it feels dated. They have cell phones and flat computer screens, but not much else. The skillset used on both sides of the conflict is the same as in an old movie.

The film stars Ben Affleck who is also the director and part writer and a bunch of other people, Pete Postlethwaite being the only notable, but with a real small part. Everybody does their parts, the movie is well acted, well directed and the feel of things just right; however, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed by the setting. Maybe things are just like this in Charlestown now and maybe the fibbies are just as dumb in real life, but I kind of doubt it.

Conclusion: good enough film for its category, but not exactly my piece of cake. Now alien bank robbers... that would be cool!",8

19 October 2012,Do the people cause the town pressure or does the town cause the people the pressure?,"It's an understatement to say that Ben Affleck's first directorial effort, Gone Baby Gone, took audiences by surprise. Here was the man who, just a few years back, was Matt Murdoch in a rather hokey adaptation of Daredevil, was plastered on the cover of tabloids with Jennifer Lopez in his arms, which brewed untold ridicule, and was caught up in a whirlwind of uncertainty as an actor. I hate to continue to ride on Affleck's past, but after seeing Gone Baby Gone and The Town, two films promoting the fact that the man is serious about coming back to the industry with a serious, no-nonsense persona, I'd love for him to be the poster-child of actors turned directors that can show others change in the industry can come whenever and, if you're serious, you can be accepted and praised highly.

For the most part, The Town works on both the levels it wants to, which are as efficient action entertainment and commentary on the world of robbery and the culture of criminality. We are introduced to Charlestown, Massachusetts, a gray, gloomy city built on crime and robberies. The town is known for its explicit burglaries conducted by four men, unidentified by police. To us, they are Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James ""Jem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert ""Gloansy"" Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond ""Dez"" Elden (Owen Burke).

The film opens with the men, strapped with masks and automatic weapons, conducting a robbery on a bank and finishing the job by taking the manager, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), hostage, only to release her shortly after. Not long after the robbery, Doug becomes romantically involved with Claire, keeping his relationship a secret from the mob and the mob a secret from his relationship. In the meantime, Doug consistently contemplates leaving the mob life in Charlestown behind to favor smaller, less stressful life in the suburbs. If only he wasn't burdened and constantly threatened by the unpredictable Jem, who goes from calm to belligerent in an instant. Jem is played wonderfully by Renner, in a performance light years away from his character in The Hurt Locker. Doug's pressure also continues to skyrocket when he learns that FBI Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is explicitly tracking his mob crew and is slowly closing in on them.

Affleck takes on triple duty in the film, playing the lead role, director, and co-writer for this large project. His directing talents are employed greatly during the chase sequences in the film, which are photographed with piercing kinetic fun and stunning visual clarity. Affleck forgoes quick-cuts and a shaky camera, and instead, uses the tactics of two to three second cuts and realism in the chase scenes in order to elevate the picture's use of them. And what I mean by realism is, when a police car turns a tight corner in a compressed alley-way, he doesn't slickly turn but almost completely spins out. In a time where chase scenes look too clean and special effects the prime tool to construct an action movie, it's strikes me as refreshing to see one rely on wit and realistic movement.

The film's first act is equipped with a fine eye for detail, specifically in the shootout sequences and the robberies, and includes seriously compelling character development on McCray. The second and third act continue to focus more on the character aspect, which at times, unfortunately, feels a little weighted, but those scenes can not bog down what is clearly a fun, incredibly entertaining action film, with depth and style at its core. Again, much like in his debut, Affleck feels comfortable directing a picture of this caliber, and he feels confident assuming the lead role and penning the script as well. The way he makes Boston's murky grayness into its own breathing character is something along the lines of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts, which is a remarkable and admirably talented feat. As long as he isn't distracted by dead-end projects, it would appear that the man has a long, eventful career ahead of him in his later life.

Starring: Ben Affleck, Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively, Jeremy Renner, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper. Directed by: Ben Affleck.",8

4 February 2011,Ghost Town - missing solid central character,"Although tensely made and full of explodey goodness, Ben Affleck's The Town suffers from a knack of reaching into the cliché sack a few too many times. It also suffers from being directed by Ben Affleck, who surrounds himself here with people who can act circles around him, making him – as the central character – look really one dimensional. It's as if Carrot Top made a movie with Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Ralphe Fiennes, and Greta Garbo.

Affleck plays a bank robber named Doug (ha! a thug named Doug!). A rather successful bank robber, at that. (It's noted before the titles that that the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown is notorious for turning out scads of bank robbers.) During a holdup, Affleck's masked gang temporarily takes bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage; believing her to be a loose end who might be able to identify them, Doug trails Claire and meets cute with her, hiding his secret. Concurrently, an intrepid FBI agent – no other kind in moviedom – played by Jon Hamm is closing in.

Among Doug's gang is Jem (Jeremy Renner), a loose cannon who enjoys the thrill and violent nature of their escapades and who spent a nine-year hitch in prison, so you know he's tough as can be. While Doug is portrayed as thoughtful, careful, and caring, Jem is the foul-mouthed jerk who supposedly shorter on brains than Doug. Jem immediately questions the wisdom of dating their former hostage; if he had his druthers, he'd just kill Claire and be done with it. But that would go against the gang's mantra of not killing people, so Doug gets to keep seeing Claire. You know, to find out what she knows. Or if she's talked to the feds.

The movie asks us to believe two conflicting things about Doug: that he's amoral (he is a bank robber, after all) and yet moral (i.e., cares for Claire, cares for his buddy Jem, cares for Jem's sister Krista, cares for almost everyone. He's sort of a sensitive Clyde Barrow. Affleck's not a terrible actor, but it's tough to really buy into him in this role. He has the accent down (big surprise there), but he seems to equate speaking softly and looking pensive with a multilayered performance.

Another problem is Claire herself. Seems like a nice person, although she falls for Doug pretty quickly (they meet in a laundromat shortly after the robbery). And although she's pretty upset when she eventually learns the truth about Doug, she still gives him a chance. Why she would do this is anyone's guess. If they'd been together years, it still wouldn't make much sense. He's a bank robber, not Robin Hood. He's not a good guy.

The movie is fast paced, so these plot problems aren't really that big of a deal. By the way, while Dougie is trying to get in good with little miss Claire, he's still robbing banks, so of course you can see the standard ""this is my last job"" deal coming from a mile away. Doug's group gets its jobs from The Florist, played by Pete Postlethwait in his final role; he gives them all the intel they need, and they pull off the job. It's a working system, so why break it? I just think we'd have a little more sympathy for Doug if, say, he had to rob banks in order to pay the mortgage in a terrible economy, or he had a wife and two kids with a third on the way and his wife was dying of some lung disease, like in Brooklyn's Finest. You know, a fairly good guy forced to do bad because of circumstances. But that is not the case here. There's no reason for us to like Doug, and so he's a pretty unlikeable person. Sure, he treats Claire well. Except when he lies to her. Best line: ""I'll never lie to you again!"" That's right, trust the nice bank robber. Renner (nominated for an Oscar), Postlethwait, Hall, and even young, lovely Blake Lively (as Krista) completely outshine Affleck, making him look befuddled most of the time, as if he can just about put things together but can't quite get there.

And final odd question: are there no razors in Charlestown? Everyone has three-day old growth. It doesn't make them look tough. It doesn't make them look like they've been pulling all nighters to get the job done. It just makes them look like hobos.",5
15 April 2020,7/10,"I ended up watching the movie for some reason, and it's over. Even though the film does not contain intense action and robberies, the film progresses at a very exciting and good dose with three basic robberies. I do not fit the emotionality of such films very much, which has been kept in the foreground in this film, but it is gathering itself towards the end.

24 October 2010,Affleck's movie directing growth,"Ben Affleck's second film is one of the best movies of the year. I'll try to tell you why. First off, it's better than its predecessor ""Gone Baby Gone"". I find impressive that Affleck decided step it up in almost every aspect: ""The Town"" runs longer, cuts deeper, increases in action scenes and in character development. We remember more characters and the romantic relationship at the center of the film is given more time and because the script is morally consistent, ""The Town"" is one of the few crime movies in which we care more about the criminal's life than the success of the robbery of a bank or a truck. Dramatically, it's irresistible.

Talking about increasing risks. After years of trying to build a better reputation as an actor by participating in films that wouldn't stain his image, and after directing a film that gained him respect even when his acting skills weren't as recognized still, Ben Affleck decides to be himself the star of the show. He plays Doug MacRay, an expert robber that works with a very skilled gang in Charlestown: instructed by The Florist (Pete Postlethwaite), they tackle the best jobs in town and, because something always goes wrong, in the middle of a bank robbery, they take the manager, Claire, (Rebecca Hall) as a hostage. They drop her in some beach and start watching her to make sure she doesn't say anything to the police. Because she knows, we know. Doug starts seeing her and later on Claire recalls the robbers told her to walk until she felt the water: ""It was the longest walk of my life; I thought I'd fall from a cliff"".

Doug starts dating Claire because his impulses tell him so. He can't fight it. Women in both of Affleck's films tend to present this quality that goes beyond beauty: either they are independent and kind, women you want to fly to heaven with; or self-destructive and troubling, women you inevitably want to save. The common factor is that they are both very vulnerable. Both women co-exist in Doug's life, and we can see that he's trapped; he wants to do something. But at the same time, ""The Town"" is about the things we can't help. I mean, of course, the things we shouldn't really do when we think about them.

Name a character and I'll point out a weakness. The script of the fillm, based again on a novel and written by Affleck and Aaron Stockard alongside Peter Craig, provides characters with huge moral dilemmas. In ""Gone Baby Gone"", this aspect made its crowning way towards a climatic ending, and it worked. Here it's all over the place, because every decision is apparently life-changing, because every conversation holds a secret. Because the past, never absolutely revealed yet always present, is devastating.

Writing always from the heart but this time without the intention of generating impact, Affleck might have achieved his best screenplay. The genre conventions we find in the story are the ones that make the movie 'activate' (to just say something), but a whole different thing makes the movie breathe. The way Affleck has of capturing, again, a specific place and making it his own. He masters a special mood (thank you for that score again Harry Gregson- Williams), he dominates the codes, he drives the streets and he walks the roofs in order to leave no doubt that he knows, again, what he's talking about.

The characters, and their involvement in a story that we need to see told show the growth and the natural flowing of a director who's as generous as every great actor/writer/director that, from time to time, decides to be the hero. That generosity is expressed in a way that we can realize he's the main star but everyone who stands by him is perfectly chosen to shine and still not surpass him. That's why Jeremy Renner turns in a stupendous performance as Doug's best friend, a fine step to follow his Oscar nomination; that's why Affleck gives Blake Lively of ""Gossip Girl"" the –up to now- part of her life; that's why John Hamm feels at times underused and a bit caricaturized as a federal agent; and that's also why major names like Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper have only a couple of scenes.

I believe these are the right calls, by a director so confident that in the end truly becomes the brightest (in intelligence and in light) star. I honestly think Affleck's performance is the winning one: I believe in everything Doug says and does and I root for him all the way. I found myself touched by ""The Town"", a film not intentionally made for that effect, but with all the elements in place to end up causing it. If you don't agree with all this none sense, it's only fair to say the film is a part action, part crime, romantic and dramatic feature with family/friendship subplotsStraightly told, visually appealing, Hollywood-ish if you prefer. That should also be enough if you want to make one of the year's best films.",9
23 June 2017,"Another Strong Vehicle For Ben Affleck To Showcase His Filmmaking Aptitude. Tense, Exciting & Thrilling.","Riding on the momentum provided by its consistent dose of intensely gripping action, The Town is a tense, thrilling & entertaining crime thriller that, despite leaving none of the genre clichés on the sidelines, succeeds in keeping a firm grip on the viewers' attention and is more engaging than one expects.

Set in Charlestown, a breeding ground for armed robbers, the story of The Town follows a gang of four lifelong friends who, after a series of successful bank robberies and close encounters with the police, set out to finish one final heist. But monitoring them closely is an FBI agent who's all set to bring them down.

Co-written, directed by & starring Ben Affleck, The Town serves as another vehicle for the actor to showcase his filmmaking talents and there's plenty in the picture that attest to his eye for creating kinetically charged sequences that brim with excitement & tension. Affleck's direction is quite lean during moments of action but not so in the dramatic portions.

While Michael Mann's Heat is an obvious inspiration, the overcast ambiance & setting is lifted from other notable crime thrillers. The story is riveting when it's dealing with the group's interactions or next assignments but loses interest whenever it attempts to focus on their separate lives. There's a lot that it could've done without, for those scenes only end up hampering its overall effectiveness.

Coming to the performances, The Town packs a talented ensemble in Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall, John Hamm, Blake Lively & Pete Postlethwaite, with Renner leaving the most lasting impression of them all with a strong, stellar input. Affleck plays his part responsibly, Hall does well with what she's given, Hamm is just as good while Postlethwaite greatly impresses in his brief part.

On an overall scale, The Town is thoroughly captivating, is expertly directed & benefits a lot from Jeremy Renner's show-stealing performance but it could've been much more if its drama was half as compelling as its masterly choreographed action segments. Nevertheless, Affleck's sophomore directorial effort further sharpens his filmmaking skills, has got more positives than negatives, and is going to satisfy most viewers, if not all. Definitely worth a watch.",
27 September 2010,A Town? Perhaps. A Yawn? Definitely,"A bloke in a bank-heist gang falls for the bird him and his mates kidnap for a little bit then release during their last job. Er, what else happens? Oh yeah, they put rubber masks on so they look like old nuns and do another (but that's in the trailer) and then do another but without the same success as the previous two. The End.

Unoriginal, unsurprising, unexceptional, uninteresting and at times Ben Aflick's attempts at Brando-esquire mumbles are unintelligible.

This film certainly wasn't unpredictable, unexpected, unusual or unique. Don't bother seeing it or renting it, just wait for it to be aired on either Sky3 or ITV4.

13 July 2012,The Town - 4.5 Stars,"A single square mile in Boston called Charlestown contains more bank robbers than any other municipality in America. And it is here where the setting of one of the best films of 2010 takes place. ""The Town"" is a powerful force that explores thoughts deeper than that of most films about organized thieves.

We are introduced to four criminals who are about to empty out an innocent bank. Two of them, Doug and James, are given much attention throughout the movie. The other two are, uh, well I believe there hasn't been a successful heist before in movie history that featured less than four guys. So there you go.

Because this is just the opening scene, the cops arrive right after the crooks get away, and in movie rules, they're just in time. But the movie is not about the cops, but the criminals. And the characters of Doug and James, superbly acted by Ben Afleck and Jeremy Renner, provide us with great material to study.

He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better.

21 September 2012,Fantastic!!!,"Ben Affleck's film ""The Town"" is great. The direction is excellent. All of the performances are fantastic. The story is original and feels very personal. Charlestown is the perfect setting for the film. The characters are compelling and fully fleshed out. Ben Affleck proves all of his critics wrong with a riveting performance. Jeremy Renner delivers an excellent performance. Jon Hamm and Chris Cooper turn small roles into performances that are quite memorable. Rebecca Hall's performance is wonderful and emotionally engaging. However, my favorite performance of the film was delivered by Blake Lively. She is unbelievably beautiful, as well as a stellar actress. The screenplay is intelligent, riveting and quite original. I can't believe it wasn't nominated for Best Picture. I absolutely loved the film. ""The Town"" is one of the best films of 2010.

27 August 2019,Offers so much,"Heists, chases, shootouts, brotherhood, romance, broken families, revenge, dark humor. It's all crammed in there, and somehow it works! Affleck is a pretty damn good actor, but an even better director, and whoever did the casting also hit it out of the (Fenway) park. Hamm, Renner, Hall are all fantastic, and I was particularly impressed by Blake Lively. We even get nice cameos from Chris Cooper and Pete Postlewaite. The action is very well paced and never feels unrealistic or forced. No lazy writing here, just great drama, action, and even a (sort of) happy ending.

20 September 2010,Okay,"The Town is an okay movie, not great and not bad. I give it an average rating of 5 points out of 10 on the I.M.D.B. system of weights and balances, ha ha.

Director Ben Affleck does a decent job with the material. The story is very gritty for him but it is also kind of predictable and trying to follow the footsteps of movies such as The Departed. The acting is fairly ho-hum in quality and as I said it is a predictable story, it is gritty and supposedly ""real"" to some but I never really was convinced I was watching anything but a Hollywood movie. It never really drew me in to the story.

I'd say it's worth seeing but save your 10 quid and catch it on D.V.D. I saw it with friends and we had an O.K. time.... as I said it is O.K.

8 January 2011,A Well Polished Turd,"Many people seem to love Ben Affleck's The Town. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised by that. I mean we do live in a society in which almost all our popular culture is fake. Fake ""reality"" shows flood our current television channels, the music business is full of fake posturing and overly manufactured acts, and Hollywood keeps filming the same old stories with bad writing, big star names, and lots of glitzy glamour. All flash and very little substance seems to be the trend of the day, or should I say decade? Well The Town is not much different, it too is a well polished turd. A turd that lacks pretty much any originality at all. The dialogue and overall quality of writing in this film should easily be surpassed by the average tenth grade student if challenged. Seriously, is there a single stretch of 10 minutes in this film that actually seemed like it could, or might be able to happen in reality? I've been around. From the big house to the white picket fence to the bad side of town and I'm telling you that no, there is nothing real. Nor is there anything meaningful here. This basically seemed like a badly written cartoon made into an even worse film. None of the characters who are given time to develop are anything more than cartoon like. Has the majority of people these days lost all perspective on what is realistic, and what is a total sham? It certainly seems so.",4

16 October 2012,A great crime thriller,"Ben Affleck is probably most remembered for things like Daredevil (bad) or Gigli (atrocious), so you'll probably be forgiven if you didn't really want to go and see this movie. You'd be forgiven, but you would be asked to reconsider. Because 'The Town' is one of the best crime thrillers to come around in a helluva long time.

Affleck writes, directs and stars in this story about Doug, a bank robber struggling between the demons of his criminal past, and a hopeful new life in the form of love - and former heist victim - Claire (Rebecca Hall).

There are lots of action sequences in this movie. You've got the bank robberies and the car chases and the gunfights. All the good stuff you'd expect from a crime drama. But 'The Town' is so much more than that. It is a study of the hopeless, pigeon-holed lives of working class criminals, having nowhere else to go and nothing else to do, and what happens to these people when the chance for redemption rears its head. And at the heart of it all is a spectacular performance from Ben Affleck himself.

It's funny, because the last great Affleck performance I remember is 'Good Will Hunting'; and, lo and behold, he wrote that too. Affleck is seemingly at his best when he is control, and he calls all the shots here. The result is fantastic. He's helped, too, by some equally fantastic performances from Rebecca Hall and Jeremy Renner, and what could be a career-defining role for Blake Lively.

What probably lets the film down is its length. At two-and-a-half hours, it requires a lot of patience and attention, but it's worth it in the end. Maybe there could have been half an hour shaved off, but I then also can't recall any sequences that felt dispensable. Everything was there for a reason, meticulously written and wonderfully shot.

I remember reading somewhere that Ben Affleck was starting to become the Clint Eastwood of this generation. I scoffed at it. But watching this movie, and knowing what Affleck had done with 'Good Will Hunting', my opinion has begun to change. If writing and directing will make Affleck churn out films like 'The Town', then let the man write and direct at his leisure. A must-watch.",8
23 September 2010,"A smartly-written, fascinating character study (and good movie) with a few easily-forgiven flaws","A great many people now seem to have forgiven Ben Affleck for not-so-satisfying works from him the past, now that his new film ""The Town"" (a fascinating, tautly-written character study disguised as a bank heist nail-biter) is out. I am not incredibly familiar with Mr. Affleck's work, but this very enjoyable movie has a parallel for me. Most of it is so good that I can easily forgive the fundamental flaws that it does have.

Ben Affleck is not only the director, but the star of ""The Town"" in which he plays an experienced, methodical, charismatic (and concerned) bank robber in Charlestown. During one of his heists, things go awry and Affleck and his men must take the bank manager hostage. They escape and release her and later on, concerned that she might have learned something that could sell them to the FBI, Affleck tracks the manage (Rebecca Hall) down and eventually meets her. In the process of deciphering information from her, he also forms a slow but inevitable romantic relationship with his onetime hostage and things take a turn for the worst when the FBI gets involved.

Mr. Affleck is a highly talented filmmaker as well as an actor. Actually, if you were to ask me to list his pros and cons, I'd say he's an even greater director because there is not one single poorly-done moment in ""The Town."" There are some flaws with the screenplay and some character-to-character relationships, but he is able to command his cameras, cast, and crew with kinetic proficiency while giving a more than commendable performance all at the same time. Mr. Affleck is not yet the masters such as Clint Eastwood, who do the same time, but he is quickly rising to that status.

However, I think some people will be misled by the advertising. This is not really a nail-biter like ""The Bourne Identity."" It's more of a straightforward, focused character study on our central character. There are obligatory scenes of action, including a very exciting climax at the finale, but it's the human relationships that are the core of the picture. Mr. Affleck is almost always on camera and it is his relationship to the character played by the gorgeous and talented English actress Rebecca Hall that is the most fascinating and compelling element of the entire picture. The scenes between them have so much power, so much fresh dialogue, and so much romantic persuasiveness that it makes up for the lack of real development say between Affleck and his childhood pal played by Jeremy Renner or his boss, played by Pete Postlethwaite. Mr. Affleck and Ms Hall are so perfectly cast for their roles and they do a wonderful job at developing this at-first kinetic and then complicated love affair. I loved and cherished every single minute where these two were on-screen and frankly, I wish there had been more of them because it's between these two characters that we have a solid connection. With the others, it's kind of dicey.

It is because this movie is a character study and that some of the connections between characters is underwritten that I cannot give ""The Town"" a higher rating and why I think it doesn't realize it's full potential. The friendship between Affleck and Renner shows promise and has originality in its moments, but there are not enough scenes of them together and not enough is learned about Mr. Renner's character to really care what becomes of their friendship. And although Pete Poslethwaite is one of the best actors of modern times, he doesn't have much more to do here than he did in the remake of ""Clash of the Titans."" I'm sorry to say that he was a rather boring villain, as was the FBI agent played by John Hamm. In addition, I felt Affleck's relationship to a one-time flame played by Blake Lively was fascinating, but underdeveloped and that the sex scene between the two of them, like many, was a complete throw-away.

""The Town"" is a very enjoyable movie and I do owe it a lot of gratitude. Because before I saw this picture, I had seen three absolutely detestable movies right in a row, one of which was making me feel abandoned by the cinema and wanting to resort to staying home and watching my old favorites. Thankfully, Mr. Affleck delivered a very well-directed film with mostly hits (and a few misses) in his story and my love for the movies has been restored. The film does have its flaws, but they are easily forgiven and the second hour of the picture strikes with so much kinetic energy and (more importantly) emotion that I instantly and gladly recommend ""The Town.""",7
11 December 2010,I am undecided on this thriller,"This film is about the life a big time thief after robbing a bank. He dates one of the victims in the robbery, while the FBI is on the hunt for him.

""The Town"" is not a conventional action thriller, as it has an actual plot. So many action thriller nowadays involve mindless violence and senseless explosions, but ""The Town"" has none of these problems. It has well developed emotional elements in the background of action. The relationship between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall is well portrayed and developed. It is interesting to see how their relationship is tested when the truth comes out, and it is satisfying to see how their relationship end up to be in the end.

I find the middle parts of the film a little slow, but the ending parts make up for it. ""The Town"" is a reasonably entertaining movie, but I feel a little undecided on whether I liked it.

3 February 2015,my favorite heist film :-),"a long time pro thief tries to get out of the criminal business after one of his earlier heists goes wrong. I had saw a commercial of this movie in high school but I never watched it until 2013 on demand for free, and I'm sure glad I did :-), the town is an awesome heist film with nonstop action and suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat, along with a great performance from Jeremy Renner, don't get me wrong, everyone else's performances were great too but jeremy renner's was the best, jimmy coughlin was very reminiscent of tommy devito from goodfellas, a fast pace, really spot on Boston accents, and a sense of excitement, and even a bit of dry humor too. all in all, I highly recommend the town to anyone who loves heist/action films, they won't be disappointed :-).

P.S. the last 11 and a half minutes are AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!

27 October 2012,hats off to Ben Affleck,"I've watched this movie a year ago.. and watched it today with my brother.. he loved it too.. then i had a thought of rating this movie. Ben Aflleck's stunning direction and hardcore performances make this a great crime-drama flick. the action and chase sequences ,firing bullets,cat and mouse game,a lot of swearing and graphical way of depicting robbers lives really works for me.

Ben affleck hit the bull's eye with the idea of showing the same thing in a different way. he has certainly earned it. Jeremy Renner is just perfect in the movie. Jon Hamm looks dashing and strong in supporting role. Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively did very good jobs. The Boston accent looks so damn real on all the actors they just nailed it

In the end,not the perfect but a very good crime movie.

13 January 2011,The bottom of the pile,"The people rating this movie well must not watch many movies. There has been some really great heist / bank robbery movies over the years, and this is not one of them. The scenes come at you in a boring and predictable fashion. One cliché after another. I wanted to like the film. I was expecting something with sizzling action and unexpected plot twists, but it just wasn't there. Very little character development left me not caring at all about some of the leads. This is all too common in many movies today. The directors are so intent on getting to the ""fun stuff"" that the groundwork isn't covered. Anyway, I'm not going to waste any more time reviewing a movie that wasted my time.

10 April 2021,"The Town is a crime thriller that should be on your radar, a well written and realistic heist film","Ben Affleck directed, co-wrote and starred in this crime thriller that follows a group of Boston bank robbers and their life after a bank job whilst the FBI agents is played brilliantly by Jon Hamm and Titus Welliver. Whilst Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner plays two of the bank robbers.

The Town is a must watch for fans of heist films or simply of cinema. It was a hit at the box office and the film was met with critical acclaim. Jeremy Renner was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and Pete Postlethwaite was posthumously nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor. It deserves all its acclaim and praise, because of how well made and well acted it is. Ben Affleck is a great director and he keeps showing his skill in both acting and directing. The cinematography is also something worth bringing up, Robert Elswit did a magnificent job. There's some brilliant imagery and scenery, you see the love of Boston the creators showed through the film.

The ensemble cast is filled with well known actors and people that I really like. Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Blake Lively, Titus Welliver, George Carroll, Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper. Everyone brings their A game, through phenomenal performances like nailing the accent.

I watched the extended cut of the movie and my review was based on that version, I'm fairly sure I have seen the theatrical cut before but the extended cut was superb. Seriously worth the money and my time, it's an incredible film.",10
13 September 2010,Definitely take a trip to The Town,"The Town takes us back to the lower class Irish Boston area backdrop from the Departed and puts it in a heist movie somewhat reminiscent of Point Break. The end result is a captivating and engrossing thriller that owes mostly to the interesting characters, action sequences and presentation than to the done to death heist movie Swiss cheese plot. We are asked again to sympathize with a bank robber Doug who's a heart of gold kind of guy that carries his automatic rifles to rob banks and to shoot at engine blocks of cop's cars. It's his last job before he puts the town in the rearview mirror with the girl he's fallen in love with.

This is an excellent movie and I recommend to everyone to go see it.

10 May 2023,"What is Tempo Error? Summary of the Movie ""The Town""","I just finished watching ""The Town"" and I felt it was quite simple, to be honest. Maybe it's because I've been watching emotionally charged films lately, but the emotional side of the movie didn't really come through for me.

First of all, I have to say that the acting was quite good and normal, so I don't have any problems with that. Also, the robbery and conflict scenes were extremely well-crafted and shot, and I think the movie owes its 7.5 rating to this, because the shaky camera and the transitions during the action scenes were very good.

Now, I come to what I think is the biggest problem with the movie and the reason why I found it emotionally inadequate: tempo problem... Starting from an extremely high tone is a great idea, but it's risky. I don't think the movie can compensate for this risk in the middle part, because you have to pass smoothly and subtly from a sudden calm tone. This is where the movie loses points for me because the tempo fluctuations are too sudden, and the details get lost in between. This also reflects on the ending, which could have been very emotional, but it didn't make me feel that way and that's why it only got 6 points from me.

In terms of technical aspects, I think Ben Affleck did a pretty good job, but I can't say the same for the screenplay and tempo. I wish it could have been a stronger, less clichéd heist movie.",6
30 September 2010,Ben Affleck's The Town was a very compelling action drama,"Well, this is the first time I've seen a movie directed by Ben Affleck, as opposed to both starring and co-writing as well, and I must say that I was very impressed with what I saw! He plays the lead character, a heist thief from the Charlestown suburb of Boston, with compelling empathy that one hopes he doesn't step too much over the line when he does the things he does here. I mean, yes, he steals and shoots and doesn't always make the right decisions but he also has a reasonable background that explains his plight. And he's picked the right cast in people like Rebacca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, Blake Lively, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper among others in bringing this action drama to the screen. I don't think I've seen any flaws, story-wise, while watching but maybe that's because I was just very absorbed on just how things seemed really connected that the whole thing just took me away. So on that note, The Town comes highly recommended.

29 September 2010,Ben Affleck triumphs in his second directing debut. A terrific heist movie mostly all round,"Ben Affleck made his first directing debut with Gone Baby Gone in 2007, which is rumoured to be fantastic as I haven't seen it. If that is the case and after watching The Town. It looks more like the case. Ben Affleck has always been a pretty solid actor but never one to get my guns blazing in my book, which just goes to show his real talent lies in directing.

The Town is set in Charlestown, USA where a group of men led by Douglas MacRay (Ben Affleck) including his best friend James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner from The Hurt Locker) for a living, storm armoured cars and rob banks for money. One bank they rob, they end up taking a hostage of pretty bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). Meanwhile the FBI including the head of the investigation Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) has been after Doug and his men for years and is determined to bring them down. Things become complicated for Doug when he falls for Claire and they embark on a romance. Will she find out the truth? As he also has to deal with his boss Fergus, a drug lord who poses as a florist (Pete Postelthwaite).

Iniatally some of the weaknesses of this movie that stopped me giving this higher than an 8 is the formulaic script that needed a lot more work and the over familiar story. But the action heist sequences are top notch and manage to create suspense and tension and are exciting to watch due to some terrific stunt driving and being exquisitely shot and edited to perfection by Affleck. He has a keen eye when it comes to these scenes, but he also manages to pull out excellent performances from his cast all round, which refreshes the over-familiar plot. Affleck himself gives a reasonable performance of a man torn between his life, friend and the woman he cares about. Jeremy Renner gives a solid supporting performance, whilst Postelthwaite is memorably creepy as Fergus and Blake Lively as tarty mum Krista who has the hots for Doug perfectly portrays a woman constantly high on drugs but feels trapped by the life she leads and wants to escape but can't or won't. The two strongest performances though come from Jon Hamm as FBI Crawley, who gets some terrific one liners, but is determined to catch Doug and Rebbeca Hall as Claire who is warm and intelligent and makes you feel for her predicament.

What is surprisingly elitist about the film is from a basic script the actors manage to turn the dialogue into something more meaningful and heartfelt, which is a incredible accomplishment. The cinematography is brilliant of the town being hard, gritty and realistic and the violence itself is handled maturely, where it is never glamorised but shown in all it's brutality. The music is superb and there are some clever disguises when they pull off the bank heists and a few moments of laughter particularly when Doug and the others have the masks of nuns and after pulling off an armoured heist, they get out of the car with the money and automatic weapons and a cop sitting in a car in the next lane sees them. They stare at each other and then he looks away was funny. The romance between Doug and Claire, though I never believed they were in love and there isn't as much romantic chemistry between them. They care about each other and the two actors are comfortable enough on screen to make us think that. But also it's more of a romance of need almost, where Claire is fractured emotionally after her hostage experience and Doug who wants to get out of the life he leads. They are like two lost souls, parts missing from each other and when they meet they are whole.

One other surprising aspect, which makes this film refreshing is the ending, which keeps you guessing. Will Doug gets away from the police with Claire at his side? Well watch The Town and find out for yourself. This is a great movie all round and is better than average thanks to superb directing, acting and suspenseful bank heists. Thanks to Affleck (and lets hope he directs more films and that they are just as good). This town is well worth visiting and a film that is worth your own time to see.",8
18 September 2010,"Great movie, Ben Affleck gains respect in a big way!","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",8
4 March 2022,Wow,"I'm late to the party on this one, but it was worth the wait. Huge fan of Jeremy Renner, and as always, HE DELIVERS! Ben Affleck and Jeremy make an amazing duo in this movie. Totally action packed and has you all over the place. The storyline never wanes or leaves you with any boring interludes waiting for something to happen. No fillers, which to me is HUGE. I love how the story came together, I loved the character development without all the added fluff. It was raw, and intense and exactly what I was hoping for. Seriously, if you're on the fence at all about watching this, TAKE THE PLUNGE! You won't regret it. I just wish I had watched it sooner!

21 December 2019,I just couldn't connect with this.,"I wanted to like it. I went in already a fan of a couple of the actors. So if anything I was inclined to like it even if it wasn't that good. However I didn't like it. One thing I didn't like was how the cops were treated like disposable bad guys who were all corrupt and deserved to die. How am I supposed to root for the good guys when the good guys aren't good at all? When they murder innocent person after person? It has been a while since I saw it so unfortunately I don't remember what else I had thought of it. However that one negative having weighed down the movie for me is something I do remember.

19 December 2010,"Thoughtful, character-driven crime drama thriller","Take a crime-ridden community with gritty streets but with young men trying to get to a better life and the hopefulness of a possible romance, and you get ""The Town"", a thoughtful and discerning dramatic thriller.

Going beyond ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2008), Ben Affleck has created an extremely well done film. Yes, it's a crime thriller, but better than that, it has real characters who each have their own motives. Most of the advancements in the plot are done rather subtly, and they are also mostly character-driven. And that's the sign of a great crime thriller.

""The Town"" should be in the running for all the major awards of the season. Affleck, Rebecca Hall, and Jeremy Renner all portrayed interesting characters that had their own reasons for getting into and out of the town full of crime. ""The Town"" is one of the best crime dramas made, especially for those wanting to see more acumen, consideration and distinction in the genre.",9
6 February 2013,The Town (2010),"I must admit that I hate Ben Affleck and don't watch his movies usually because I personally think he is not a good actor, but I watched this movie just because of his good show as a debutant director in Gone Baby Gone. And I must say he did a wonderful job here continuing from where he left in 2007 and if you ask me he could possibly be the next Clint Eastwood in the making if he keeps growing from here in the field of Direction. Adding to that, I think his effort out here will definitely earn him the Oscar nomination this year. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) was born and raised in Charlestown, a blue-collar neighborhood in Boston, where crime is a part of life. Charlestown is the world's capital for carjacking, kidnappings, and armed robberies. The tricks of the criminal trade are passed down from father to son. Doug is the brains and ruthless leader of a gang of bank robbers who have been able to get out clean after each bank robbery. But Doug knows that his luck will not last forever, and he is looking for one last big heist that will give him the chance to leave the town in his rear-view mirror. But no one will let him, especially, his right-hand man Jeremy (James Coughlin); because he believes that it would be a personal betrayal to him, and he is not going to allow that. In a recent bank job, Doug forced the bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) to open the safe, and then took her hostage as leverage for the getaway, eventually setting her free unharmed. Doug knows that he should leave Claire alone, but she only lives four blocks from him, and he can handle it, but he begins to fall for her. Their romantic involvement is about to take them down a perilous path. The film also has a terrific pace to it. It does have very little action scenes in it and they are not really needed to make this film more exciting. I say this because the lives of these characters become so involving to us that we really want to see what happens between them and what decisions they make and we do get in a sense to even care for them. It is so involving and fascinating that the over two hour running time is rarely felt because everything is so captivating. I would not single out a single performance as being the best because I think the whole cast does good work here. The direction is tight and focused and really brings the film together and makes for a really entertaining and thrilling watch. I personally liked The Town better because I really felt we got to know these characters better and the on screen chemistry was great. This film also successfully blends different genres including drama, action and even romance and all were pulled off terrifically and it felt more human to me. The Town is one of the best films of 2010 and I am glad it is doing so well with audiences and at the box office.

My Rating- 8/10",8
24 November 2010,"Tough, Realistic, Well-Acted","I very much enjoyed Ben Affleck's previous directorial effort ""Gone Baby Gone"", set in what seems to be crime filmmaker's paradise anymore, Massachusetts (Charlestown to be exact). This one seemed to be in the same vein and I liked the cast so I gave it a go.

Affleck runs a bank-robbery crew that includes Jeremy Renner, Slaine, and Desmond Elden. They've had a successful run so far, but things change when Affleck falls for a beautiful woman (Rebecca Hall) that the crew takes hostage (but releases). Meanwhile, an unrelenting FBI agent (Jon Hamm) is focused on bringing Affleck's crew down, using whatever means necessary. The group decides to agree on a hit by a gangster named the Florist (Pete Postelthwaite), and plan on it being their last.

This was a very enjoyable movie as well. I liked the absence of the political message and the move for more the ""Heat""-esque action film. Affleck's style is gritty and tough, and he does a great job with his source material. I've often said he's one of the most underrated people in Hollywood, and ""The Town"" reaffirms that belief.

While Ben Affleck is tried and true both in front and behind the camera, the rest of the cast is relatively unknown. Jeremy Renner, the up and coming actor who surprised us all in ""The Hurt Locker"", does a fantastic job as Affleck's second in command. Jon Hamm is much the same way, he's great on Madmen and he's right at home in the movie biz. Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively are beautiful ladies and wonderful actresses as well. Desmond Elden and Titus Welliver return from GBG as well, playing different characters. Finally Chris Cooper and Pete Postelthwaite only have a handful of scenes (Cooper has one) but they show why they're some of the best there are.

""The Town"" made a fine one-time viewing but probably won't stick with me as long as I had hoped. It's got great characters, chemistry, and action. Definitely recommended.",8
19 July 2012,A great spotlight for Affleck's talents,"Let's admit to a solemn truth here: heist flicks are as formulaic as any other genre film. One grand heist leads to another, more often than not there is at least one car chase, the alpha male falls for a woman, said male decides to leave his life of crime, which leads to his final escape, be that successful or not.

Let's now subscribe to another truth, this one more recent: Ben Affleck has matured well beyond his Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR foibles both in front of and, perhaps even more importantly, behind the camera. THE TOWN, then, is beautiful example of the craft of the heist formula executed perfectly and proves that Affleck, his second outing as a director, is one helluva storyteller.

Based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince Of Thieves"", THE TOWN follows a bank robbing troupe led by Affleck with Academy Award nominee Jeremy Renner along for the ride and overseen by the late, great Pete Postlethwaite all while being pursued by Jon Hamm's G-Man. Aside from the life-as-a-criminal angle, significant insight is given to Affleck and Renner's relationship, complete with daddy-issues – performed in a killer scene by Chris Cooper – and the budding romance with Rebecca Hall. The drama in these characters' lives proves to be just as strong and important as that of the robberies themselves.

And that grand heist? None other than the theft of ticket sales from Fenway Stadium and Affleck even films inside the holy internal works of the Green Monster. Affleck's direction throughout the film is meticulous and tight showing the audience his exact view on the story itself.

THE TOWN is an entertaining, well-executed movie and a great vehicle for spotlighting Affleck's talents. Also, it should be noted, this is the film that got Renner his recent super-hero and spy gigs and, more importantly, should have brought him an Oscar as well, the absence of which is the true crime here.",10
6 January 2011,Entertaining Heist Film,"""The Town"" is an excellent film that does have its flaws. It is, however, one of the best films made of 2010 (maybe the best film of th year). Ben Affleck really proves himself as a serious filmmaker with his follow up to ""Gone Baby Gone,"" which was among the best films of 2007. The direction is amazing and Affleck really impresses me here, far more than the aforementioned ""Gone Baby Gone,"" which was standard fare that is the exact opposite of ""The Town."" ""Gone Baby Gone"" relied more on story, dialogue and acting whereas ""The Town"" relies on great execution of a rather unoriginal script. If there is a major negative aspect of the film is it's complete unoriginality. It's a remake of ""Heat."" Plain and simple. Thats what it is.

The shootouts are phenomenal and they're the best since ""Heat,"" which are, pretty much, the best ever. It's a great little crime movie that yes, we've seen done before, but the performances and the craftsmanship are impeccable. That's really what makes it quite good. Its an extremely entertaining film, and for people who gravitate towards the genre (such as myself), should really enjoy it (unless they have some hatred towards Ben Affleck).

Jeremy Renner, who plays a Joe Pesci spawned stereotype, is truly amazing. He takes a blandly written character and makes him a really intense, nearly unpredictable person. He steals scene after scene he's in. It's the one true standout performance of the film. Affleck, the actor, is much better than expected, but not completely convincing as the leader of the Charlestown heist team.

You can enjoy it for what it is: a well done crime film with heavy action and good acting, or you can pick it apart for being unoriginal, which it is. If you sit and think about all the flaws of the film you can convince yourself it's an average to terrible movie. When I sit and watch it, I'm drawn in and entertained from start to finish.

The robbery sequences are gripping thanks to top notch directing, editing and sound mixing. The suspense is amazing. The ensemble cast is terrific. It's the kind of movie so entertaining that it will constantly bring me back to it. It's a magnificent achievement that does everything it sets out to do. It's one of the best films I've seen all year.",7
20 December 2010,Not bad...but,"This could have been a better movie if it were not so improbable. At one point several police cars are chasing the ""baddies"" and they can't even blow one tire out let alone capture them? IMPROBABLE for sure. Also, seems something was left out when the Feds found out the Claire character is seeing the Affleck character. Wouldn't they assume she was in on the bank robbery? They DID ask her to contact her lawyer, but there was no development there. Obviously they did believe she was innocent of knowing him before the robbery, but it would have been an interesting point delving into that plot point. Also, in the credits there is a cast listing of CLAIRE'S LAWYER, so there must have been a scene of some sorts proving her innocence. Still, a pretty watchable movie if one can suspend reality. Some have mentioned the Kris character should have been deleted, but if it were, how would the Feds know about the Fenway robbery? She's the one who told them.

24 August 2023,Typical American crime-drama movie with a predictable plot and an annoying love story.,"The first sequence of ""The Town"" is action-packed and well directed. I thought that I was in for a tense movie, with plenty of original robbery and car chase scenes. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I was not expecting a production with contorted plot twists, but not even such a boring and predictable story. I watched the extended version with 30 extra minutes. There are a few interesting moments that maybe explain a bit better certain contexts, but a lot of these additions just feel unnecessary and way too long. The love story between Doug and Claire was too forced and felt odd; it does not have anything peculiar. Out of all the characters James was probably the most interesting, because his background was very tragic, so the screenwriters explain very well why he behaves in a certain way. Maybe he is a bit cliché, but he works. The rest of the cast is composed of tropes: Ben Affleck is the usual anti-hero that wants to leave behind a life of violence, Blake Lively is the damsel in distress infatuated with the protagonist and Jon Hamm is your average FBI agent, trying to catch the criminals.

Overall the action sequences are good, but they don't really stand out. There is so much better out there. Other than the cast composed by big names and maybe the first ten minutes, there is really nothing worth mentioning about this production. The acting is passable, but none of the performances impressed me. Ben Affleck as a director completely flopped here, however he had to work with a pretty bad script as well.",4
22 November 2021,Ben Affleck does Heat.,"It's obvious Ben Affleck greatly admires Michael Mann's masterpiece Heat (it even gets a cameo in the film) with this slickly written crime story involving Boston friends who make their living as professional criminals who are masters of their craft. Things go swimmingly for the gang until they come under investigation by the FBI. Great supporting cast with Rebecca Hall, Jeremy Renner, Blake Lively and John Hamm. Highly entertaining action/drama with nice character moments. Affleck keeps getting better and better with each film.

10 February 2012,What's going on with this movie?,"I happen to love action movies, so lets be HONEST 10 out of 10 ""The Town"" as far as action is concerned..For Myself (currently leading a quiet life, lots of meditation and contemplation) it takes a certain criteria to keep me interested. One is dialogue, what goes on in peoples lives and their perspectives show if they are an in DEPTH person or NOT and trying to achieve growth or not. . The Town has all these numerous personality conflicts that is what is needed to achieve growth. I am not sure if this is known to Ben Afflect or not..he just may be acting out what his soul calling is, for HIM TO TEACH HUMANKIND!.... and then it is manifesting. That is a statement that will confuse most of us...Most of us still question this because we have not looked for conscious methods of having the LUXURY of knowing what is TRUE in our lives and what is our souls calling...so we justify instead...we worry as well..and become satisfied with that...We seek the superficial, things OUTSIDE of ourselves rather than within. We learn by pain...but we could do better. Ben is displaying and showing and teaching what is is to go against the GRAIN. You get killed your friends get killed you give up any love and are left alone...If there is a lesson....BUT lets get this straight...not just one lesson..the lesson is this....If you try to DEVELOP YOUR OWN WILLFUL PLAN...using your WILL..you will fail ...Why...because you did not think the universe is interactive with you, if you leave that out , your plan will fail.. GREAT MOVIE...perfect EXAMPLE on what not to do...The universe supplies us with these examples....do we listen?

I love the part where the detective is saying to Ben ..""You know we lifted a fingerprint off the van ..RIGHT?"" or in other words by asking that question he is revealing that it's BOGUS!

Great dialogue in this movie....lets see a ""The Town 2""",10
8 October 2010,More Heat than lite,"The point of heist movies is that they are pretty much the same. From the Aussie gem Money Movers to the classic Heat, it is another way to view the relationship between man, woman and money.

The Town - following on from The Wire - bases itself in a single urban area. We are introduced to its bad denizens. Affleck is vaguely convincing - in parts - as a lowlife criminal. Well, he isn't truly with it but he doesn't actually do harm.

Rebecca Hall performance as the innocent moll is a bit strong, but like Affleck she is watchable.

Yes, this tears off a great deal from Heat - but that is no bad thing. Heat could be remade every two years and I'd probably see it all the time. The Town is predictable but well put together, which makes you wonder what genre Affleck wants to try his hand at next.",6
8 April 2023,Worth Re-Watching Every Few Years,"Great movie, I enjoy it every time. Really good entry to the heist genre. I'm normally not a huge Ben Affleck fan but he deserves a ton of credit for The Town, it's a damn fine movie from start to finish. Nice blend of action and drama.

I give it an 8.5, rounding up to 9. The extended cut is worth the extra time. Having seen it a few times I can't imagine cutting any of it for the theatrical release. Jeremy Renner and Blake Lively both give memorable performances and take the whole thing up a notch.

Hard to articulate exactly why it's so good but it all just works. So much better than the average action/heist movie.

5 March 2020,Must-see for those looking for a good heist movie,"An iconic American bank robbery film that pays homage to Boston. Not many movies can do that.

It's not Heat, but it tries to be and deserves recognition for what it achieves. The creepy nun mask bank robbers burn an image into the mind of the viewers that keep them remembering this film for years to come.

The action and plot are a bit straightforward. It's a cat and mouse game between the cop and robber. The twists and turns as each seek their own goals leaves us at the edge of our seat.

Loved how this film paid homage to Boston and stayed true to the scenery and people.

One complaint though, the romance subplot did feel a bit cheesy. But it's a forgivable sin.

1 May 2013,"My favorite movie of all?! 9,7.","I was stunned when I first saw ""The town"". It was at a cinema in my town with an old friend of mine, a cloudy and humid day in Autumn. I did not still read the novel on which it is based, but I know there are some divergences between them two. This is the best realistic thriller I have ever seen. It takes inspiration from another masterpiece titled ""Heat"", but ""The town"" is just a bit superior. Also, from ""Ronin"", which to me, is a good heist movie, but rather worse than these two. It is wonderfully directed and starred by Ben Affleck. He is better as a director than as an actor, but he is a very good actor, as well, who was and is very lucky with the movies and people he has been working with. The movie is tense, has some unexpected twists and is not slow or boring at all. It contains the right amount of action, very crafted and realistic, like the initial heist, the car chase, the final heist at the arena... Apart from Ben, nobody from the cast was really a star when the movie was released, but nearly all of them are well-known (Chris Cooper, John Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Jeremy Renner and Blake Lively among others). All of them are perfect in their respective roles. Maybe, Jeremy Renner delivered the best role in his career. He is as believable as scary, but I love the character. The profoundization in the characters is very present, that is why good performances were required. Ben is not the most expressive actor in Hollywood, but we cannot say he overacted at all. The length and pace of the movie are perfect. The photography of Boston is very adequate and is convenient to know that Ben Affleck grew up in this city. There are some amazing twists. I do not know much about the novel, but the ending is unexpected because partially, it is not the same as in the book. I highly recommend this movie for those who like realistic thrillers with action (but not just action, also drama, suspense and good dialogues). I cannot tell more about the movie, but it is so intense and thrilling... 9,7.",9
14 May 2021,"Ben Affleck marvelous director, Jeremy Renner amazing actor","I always have a haphazzard approach to movies with Ben Affleck in it, if he is not the director himself. I don't know what it is, or why, but his acting performances are sub par compared to his stellar performances in his own movies. Yet at the same time I love watching him, he is easy on the eyes, and I don't mean 2 dimensional. At all. He conveys a relatable personality, indifferent of what kind of movie he plays in. Great voice, yes of course good looks, he mostly oozes quiet strength or something? Maybe more the chops from actors of old, like Mitchum and the likes.

But as soon as he has the script as director, something changes. I love his movies, how he tells stories, the realism and maybe it is the rhythm he can dictate that suits him better, maybe because he is an accomplished author contrived sentences are hell for him and get in the way of his acting when he is not in charge? I don't know. All I know is as soon as I see his name as director, I know I will be experiencing cinematic art, true story telling. The Town was no exception!

Jeremy Brenner... There is this new-ish crop of actors, and it seems to be seasonal, tidal even, that new batches of marvelous actors float to the top. And Renner is of the same batch that gave us Colin Farrell, a few years earlier Pitt, and dicaprio coming of age, to name a few. The list is arbitrary, you will be able to list others who entered the fray around 2002. To me at least it seems I jump on actor bandwagons batch wise, it never seems a continuous process. Anyway, Jeremy Renner is one of these actors who pull crowds, translate the times they live in, or breath the kind of acting we resonate on, and in this movie he shines like a black hole, a black diamond, a necessary danger that will more and more get out of control and you simply can't look away.

The entire cast is a pleasure to be immersed in throughout the movie, they all are convincing and not a second a dissonance disturbs the story telling. Loved every minute of it, the real relationships, the survival tactics of people without hope struggling to get on top all in their own dysfunctional ways and barely coping.

Very well done!",9
1 May 2011,Solid crime thriller that works even if significant aspects of it don't,"There was a lot of positive press for Ben Affleck's The Town when it came out in the UK - a lot of journalists keen to write pieces about how Affleck had grown up and matured into a gritty and responsible director etc etc. I was fine with this as I had been quite taken by Gone Baby Gone, but ultimately I was still coming to The Town as a fresh film. Based on the book Prince of Thieves, I understand that Affleck's first cut of the film was double the length of the released version and I can only assume that there must have been a lot of characterisation and the like in this longer version because, although some remains here, the film is a fairly straightforward affair of bank robbers being closed in on by the FBI while also planning ""one last big score"".

Although plot summaries and descriptions of the film focus on the side of the film that sees ""criminal with a heart of gold"" Doug starting a relationship with bank manager Claire (one of his victims and a possible witness), this doesn't actually make up as much of the film as I thought it would – the majority of it is tension between the main characters and of course the robbery action sequences. This is probably for the best because the ""relationship with witness"" aspect is probably the weakest and never really convinced me whenever the film relied upon it and the only time I really appreciated it was when it was a plot device or when it added to the film's main function as a thriller. This is a weakness to the film but yet it does still work because the thriller side to the film is solidly done and engaging for the most of the time.

The action sequences are well put together without ever making the viewer feel like they are watching a Hollywood action movie – they are noisy and overblown for sure, but they are done in such a way that you sort of accept them as being rather low-key and gritty (although this might be as much of a comment about Hollywood excess as it is about this film). These are the heart of the film but the foundation of it all is the creation of this part of Boston complete with characters with low aspirations, thick accents and attitudes handed down through generations. In this regard it works well and the cast mostly deliver on it. OK they are still very much playing ""types"" rather than characters but their performances are not limited by this necessarily. Affleck is solid in the lead, perhaps a little too sappy and unconvincing but he is still decent enough to do the job. Renner is better as he has none of this ""good guy at heart"" stuff to worry about, likewise Hamm is allowed to enjoy himself without worrying about the details too much. Hall relaxes as much as she can and focuses on having sufficient chemistry with Affleck to make her character work – she can't make it work but she does the best she can with it. Notable names in small supporting roles point either to deleted scenes or to the pull that Affleck has – Postlewaithe, Cooper, Garber and a few others are in there as it goes.

Overall The Town is a solidly enjoyable crime thriller with believable roots in Boston. Unfortunately not all aspects of it are as believable or as engaging because some of it just doesn't work particularly well and ultimately none of it matters as much as it would like to, but it does entertain on the way thanks to good performances, gritty presentation, solid action and an understanding of how the thriller works. Not as brilliant as some of the hype at the time would have you believe but still a decent crime thriller.",
16 February 2017,Boston in all its toughness,"I've never read the book on which ""The Town"" is based, but having seen the movie, I'm impressed. Even the concept of Boston tough can't prepare you for the nasty stuff that the movie depicts. Set in a neighborhood that apparently produces a disproportionate number of criminals, the movie focuses on a bank robber who falls for a woman whom he kidnapped in the process. We get a look both at the lives of the bank robbers, and the FBI agent investigating the robbery.

I'd say that the movie's main strength is how it looks at the lives of the different characters. It's made perfectly clear why the characters are like they are. There's no room for sugarcoating here. Although Claire is a secondary character in the movie, I found her character to be the most interesting. Kept in the dark about her lover's deeds, she functions as a link between the two worlds.

It's not a masterpiece, but worth seeing. In comparison to Ben Affleck's other movies as director it stacks up well. ""Gone Baby Gone"" was kind of empty, so this was an improvement. ""Argo"" was correct in showing the shah's life of luxury while his people lived in poverty, but should've shown his brutality. I haven't seen his most recent movie.

Worth seeing.",8

3 November 2014,Great Crime Movie,"As he plans his next job, a longtime thief (Ben Affleck) tries to balance his feelings for a bank manager (Rebecca Hall) connected to one of his earlier heists, as well as the FBI agent (Jon Hamm) looking to bring him and his crew down.

While Affleck had grown up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he barely heard of Charlestown before joining the project. Regardless, he was a good fit for writer and director, if not star, because of his connection to Boston. Besides him and Matt Damon, who in Hollywood really represents Boston? They have been real champions of the city and its stories.

Jeremy Renner was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance, and this was well-deserved. From the moment he appears on screen, audiences know he is the power behind the film (with all due respect to Affleck). He has the look and the skills.

In the tradition of ""Heat"" and ""The Departed"", this is a great crime movie, one of a growing number centered around Boston (thanks for this, Whitey Bulger). And now, thanks to an extended version, fans can enjoy it for two and a half hours (with or without Affleck commentary).",7
28 April 2020,Gets more ridiculous by the minute,"I thought i'd like this movie but when things started to get pretty unbelievable and unlikely on too many occasions that was it for me... Quite a lot of bs... Giving 5 stars for the action bit that was ok and for the fact i've watched it all even though the last 20 min was with a completely ""i've given up"" mind. I can't believe the high ratings.

9 November 2012,Good But Not Great,"Despite many positive reviews by fellow movie lover which lead me to watch this, I rather find this film a mediocre at its best.

Synopsis: A robber fell in love with the bank he just robbed while at the same time tried to distance himself from the crime business and the rest of the gang.

The story is nothing new that we haven't already seen or heard. And this movie makes sure it stays that way. You can very much predict from scene to scene what going to happen next who die and who lives, but despite from that it is still mildly entertaining that two and the half hours went by quite fast with decent amount of action sequences.

The casting was alright though for me not a single person was really stood out in their performance. Only two days went by and I hardly think about those characters and the movie anymore. I don't even understand how Jeremy got the nod from the Oscar, he hardly has any screen time and his performance was hardly remembering (despite the fact I watch the unedited DVD).

As for the direction and everything else was also very ordinary. Ben tell good story but he has no artistic vision. Everything was very straight forward, man shoot a man, man kill a man, man love a women etc. Everything else is just bland.

All in all it is another ordinary movie. I can't really understand why people find it to be very good drama/heist movie, to the point that they even compare it to HEAT. This film is not even close to HEAT and I don't think I will likely watch this again anytime soon.

Recommendation: Sure, you might it more than I do. Worth a rent!! Rating: 6.5/10",7

17 August 2013,good work from Ben Affleck on all counts,"""The Town"" is a 2010 film written by, directed by, and starring Ben Affleck. Needless to say, it's set in and around Boston.

Affleck plays Doug McRay, a robber whose specialty is robbing payroll and bank trucks, though he and his buddies have done a couple of banks. On one of the robberies, an assistant manager (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage by one of the gang (Jeremy Renner). When he sees her driver's license, he realizes that she only lives four blocks away from one of the gang and starts getting worried she'll recognize him, although they both wore masks.

Doug manages to run into her at the laundromat; she doesn't recognize him, and the two start a relationship. Meanwhile, the FBI, led by Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"" is closing in, and Doug wants out. However, he finds that getting out isn't as easy at it seems.

Affleck and his cowriters haven't penned the world's most original script, though it has some interesting features. It was fun to see the Boston and surrounding locations, and the car chases were terrific. You have to accept a certain amount of dramatic license as there are a couple of holes. The acting is good, from Affleck, Hall, Renner, Chris Cooper, who plays Affleck's imprisoned father, Hamm, and Pete Postlethwaite. Hall has gone on to become a major leading woman in Britain.

Affleck has proved his directing mettle with ""Argo"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" certainly and he just needs to continue his good work in this area. I'm sure everyone thought his career was over after ""Gigli"" -- I think Affleck has even more surprises in store.",7
24 September 2010,I'm puttin' this whole town in my rear view mirror,"According to Scott Fitzgerald, there are no second acts in American lives. Which just goes to show how little he knew; Ben Affleck could tell him otherwise, and it's easy to see what attracted him about this story. This is about a man searching for another chance, and a way of escaping the town that forms his prison.

It's also about robberies, of course. There are three in total, at the start, in the middle and at the end of the movie, but while all three are superbly staged and shot, they're more punctuation than the main point of the plot. It's really about Affleck's character, trapped by circumstance, by family and ultimately by blackmail, and his attempts to escape the very grim destiny represented by his father, who will have to 'die five times' before he gets out of prison.

It's also a romance, of a sort, and one that plays out believably. Without giving too much away, this may be the first movie I've seen that genuinely explores the consequences of a robbery for the victims, and Affeck's character sees for the first time the damage he does. There is no glamour here. Robbers damage people, even if they don't shoot anyone, and in the end they're as damaged as anyone else.

Everyone in the movie is great, especially Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall and Pete Postlethwaite in a cameo that moves from minor character to a force of pure, blackest evil. But in the end it's Affleck's film, as actor and director. He's earned his second chance, in spades. It's no surprise that he wanted to make a movie about a man who's looking to atone for his past sins. What will be a surprise, at least to some people, is how good - and how deep and serious - this film is.",9
5 December 2010,"Good in parts, but characters don't ring true","Thank the Lord Ben Affleck wasn't allowed to make the four hour cut. It's too long as it is. But this means the drastic cut makes the plot-line jumpy, and one presumes it has shortened character development.

No-one could seriously care about, or identify with, any of the characters, either the cops, the robbers or the Rebecca Hall character, and so the movie falls down at the most basic level.

The bank robbery and car chase sequences are enjoyable, but then again so what. Most robbery and chase scenes tend to be so, but that doesn't make it worth two hours of your time or money.

There can be absolutely no comparison to the French Connection, as some people here make. Doyle and his sidekick were driven, dedicated cops against the harm done by Charnier and his heroin traders.

But nobody could care less about the banks who are robbed (especially nowadays, so the special agent played by John Hamm may as well be a bank collection agent for all we care. The point is made more than once in the film, when they say things along the lines of 'it's not your money, don't be a hero'.

And the criminal characters live such crappy lives, you wonder what they do with all the money. At least in the Sopranos, Tony lives in a big, comfortable house, and his wife has lots of expensive jewellery and high-end vehicles, though of course his family lacks the respectability that property level, which is why is wife is so unhappy.

Here, these guys just live in grim apartments and drink in down at heel neighbourhood bars, so what's the point of taking the risk that you'll end up in jail for the rest of your life? And none of them seem to have any identifiably different personality from the others, apart from the psycho Florist, played as an Ulsterman by Peter Poslethwaite.

And a young bank manager would never in the world associate with the Affleck's working class character, even in America.

I think this film will sink without trace. Seems to me Affleck was over-indulged by the studio.",4

7 October 2010,"Affleeeeeeck insures ""The Town""!","The talk of the town is that Ben Affleck's ""The Town"" will be a legitimate power player during this year's movie awards season. After visiting ""The Town"", I could see why. Big Ben has proved one more time that he can pass for a legitimate movie director with another triumphant directorial effort in his sophomoric try behind the lens. His directorial debut was the very good ""Gone Baby Gone"". The narrative of ""The Town"" resides in the blue-collar town of Charlestown; a suburb of Boston where bank robberies are of Boston Common. Affleck stars as Doug Macray, the bank robber leader of a gang of four thieves who habitually steal away in the heart of Charlestown; and you can take that to the bank! Jeremy Renner co-stars as Macray's right-hand hot-tempered robbery man James Coughlin, who will take prisoners and do whatever it takes for his victims to cough up the cashola. Jon Hamm is sandwiched here as FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley, a mad man whose relentless pursuit of Macray and Co. takes center stage several times in ""The Town"". Rebecca Hall is the hall female monitor (whatever that means) in this one portraying Claire Keesey, a bank hostage victim of Macray who falls in love with him; being unaware that it was a Bad Doug that held her hostage during a bank heist. Pete Postlethwaite is Fergie Colm, a malicious Charlestown criminal kingpin who ""not Colmy"" barks the orders to Macray and his crew for their bank robbery gigs. In other words, I have a feeling its not going to be a good night when this Fergie is around. Yep, the gossip is true, Blake Lively co-stars as Krista Coughlin, Dougie's sleazy ex-girlfriend who is also James' sister. But in reality, the main character of ""The Town"" is Boston. Affleck is uplifted by the profound love of his hometown and Bentown, I mean Beantown, becomes the centerpiece to the revolving narrative of the movie. Affleck's directorial skills in ""The Town"" are potent, enthralling, and unpretentious. He is deserving of a Best Director Academy Award nomination for painting ""The Town"" red with some stirring action-packed sequences, and undoubtedly for the story's character interplay. Credit also goes to Ben and co-writer Peter Craig for scripting ""The Town"" with its words. All the aforementioned performances are worthy of Oscar nominations. But I was primarily taken back by Lively's lively emotional punch as Krista, Renner's stellar work as brother James, and Pistol Pete Postlethwaite himself for his brawny performance as the despicable Fergie (that's a first, ""despicable"" and ""Fergie"" in the same sentence). I was also down with The Town's musical score, art direction, and most of all for Robert Elswit's astounding cinematography; the witty Elswit should garner a Best Cinematography Academy Award nomination come Oscar time. So I think it's about time you hit the town and cinematically reside in ""The Town"" for a couple of hours, Big Ben will make sure its worth your time! ***** Excellent",9

10 September 2018,Heist drama with a degree of Heat,"An American crime thriller; A story about the leader of a bunch of ruthless bank robbers who risks blowing their cover when he falls in love with one of the hostages. A smartly written drama with a good cast set in a crime-ridden part of Boston, USA. There are some similarities with films like ""Heat"" and ""Carlito's Way"" but it holds its own with its rich story. Some of the action sequences are sharp and orchestrated well though the final heist stretched believability. What starts out as a promising drama about the culture of crime and how it envelops generations in inner city communities becomes a stunts and gunfight fest with a bull-headed tone. But, Jeremy Renner has intensity and Ben Affleck was adept with his conflicted character.

2 December 2010,"Directing wise, Ben Affleck is THAT new kid on the block!","After delivering us the beautiful movie Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck return to the big screen as both actor and director with his latest action-packed drama ""The Town"". This movie is the another proof of Affleck's intuition and knowledge of what a movie should deliver. He implements an interesting story that revolves around good developed characters by combining thrilling action scenes with dramatic personal issues. The depths of brotherhood and personal ego are explored along with the inner desire for changing which rises in each person in their lifetime.

During his travel to reach personal liberty, redemption and happiness, Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), an experienced thief tries to balance his way out of the business by trying to reason with his violent partner, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), manage his personal feelings for Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) and leave his old and rusty life behind. The problem is he has to do all these things while Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), an FBI agent is on his tail. The characters are very well written, the action scenes and the different situations that these thiefs are getting in are pretty realistic. The movie sets a dark tone from the beginning by bringing to the screen the differences between these two partners: James the impulsive one and Doug the reasonable. This conflict seems to take a different turn when Doug falls for a ""witness"" of one of their bank thefts, Claire Keesey. Despite the fights and disagreements, both find a way to remember that they're brothers till the end no matter what happens. Therefore, the subject of ""brotherhood"" has a really realistic approach. That's what impressed me about this movie: the realism. But that alone does not make a movie to be that good as this movie is being praised. What makes that is the perfect intersection of action and emotion. The only movie from this genre that succeeded so well to hit the audience on both the emotional level and pure action entertainment was ""Heat"", and that my friends was long time ago.

All the parts from this movie were chosen perfectly. Stand-outs being Jeremy Renner as James Coughlin, the violent and impulsive thief and Blake Lively as James's sister Krista, which was an actual alcoholic ""prostitute"" who had in the past a close relationship with Doug (Ben Affleck). These two portrayals of their characters got my attention and I'm not being naive if I say that they might have a shot at being nominated at the Academy Awards. Also, Ben Affleck did a great job but his directorial capabilities succeeds his acting skills by far. The cinematography was good, the sound was good, the effects were very realistic but what impressed me was the choice for the score, the background music which was pretty intense. Point is, this movie is easily one of the best action movies in the last couple of years and definitely one of the best in 2010. It has interesting storyline, good narrative drawing of the characters, a very good technical execution and it's both entertaining and touching at the same time.",8
17 October 2010,"Believe it or not, Ben Affleck is back","Younger viewers may not remember this but back in the mid to late nineties Ben Affleck was actually considered pretty cool. Between starring in Kevin Smith's ""Chasing Amy"" & ""Dogma"", he won an Oscar for co-writing ""Good Will Hunting"" and hit the big time in Michael Bay's ""Armageddon"". However, as the saying goes, what goes up must come down. Following repeated embarrassments like ""Reindeer Games"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Daredevil"" and especially ""Gigli"", Affleck's cred just about vanished. In recent years, though, Affleck has slowly picked himself back up and even branched out into directing with 2007's well-received ""Gone, Baby, Gone"". Now comes ""The Town"", which sees Affleck handling acting, directing and co-writing duties.

The story takes place in the Charlestown neighbourhood of Boston and has certain similarities to Michael Mann's ""Heat"". Here, a group of skilled bank robbers find that their latest heist has become complicated because the woman that they took hostage lives in the same neighbourhood and could possibly identify them. When the leader of the group (Affleck) approaches the woman in an attempt to keep the situation under control he begins to have feelings for her. For the remainder of the film, the group continues to carry out ever more daring jobs as the authorities close in on them.

Despite similarities to ""Heat"", the film stands on it's own due to the novel relationship between robber & hostage. The robberies themselves are well-staged and serve to propel the action of the film. Helping to bring the script to life is a well-stocked cast. Affleck gives his best performance in years but he's upstaged by Jeremy Renner. Rebecca Hall is also a standout while Jon Hamm, Blake Lively, Pete Postlethwaite & Chris Cooper all lend quality support.

Affleck's direction is well done, too, and I'd say it shows a bit of improvement over ""Gone, Baby, Gone"". The soundtrack & score didn't stick in my memory but they were serviceable at the very least.

In the end, ""The Town"" is a captivating crime drama that nicely balances action and emotion. As critics proclaim that Affleck has re-discovered his muse I can only hope that we see more like this from him.",8
2 March 2022,Robber Romance,"I'd been avoiding ""The Town"" for years. I know it had excellent reviews, but every time I saw the trailer I saw a robber romance which I've seen before. The criminal who falls in love and wants to get out of the game.

Now that I've watched it I can definitively say that it is a robber romance. It's not bad, just nothing I'd gush over.

Our main character is Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) the compassionate criminal. He's the crook with a conscience who doesn't kill and is a good guy when he's not robbing. He and his crew do bank and armored truck heists. The movie begins with a bank robbery in which they take a bank manager hostage by the name of Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). The number two on the crew, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), takes her license as a form of insurance to ensure she won't say anything to the police. Doug, in order to follow up on that insurance, tails her, meets her, dates her, and falls in love. Love is love regardless of the meeting circumstances right?

Soon, Doug finds himself totally boxed in. He had the feds on his tail, his crew making demands, his boss threatening him, and the woman he wants to run away with. It was an impossible situation and something would have to give. Can he make a clean escape with his paramour?

Without a doubt the most exciting parts are those involving robberies. It's very reminiscent of the movie ""Heat."" The budding romance is more or less a distraction and a filler, unless of course you like romances. ""The Town"" may just be a victim of hype. I liked it, but I was looking for a cinematic masterpiece based upon the reviews, and it fell well short of that.

14 October 2010,Jeremy Renner Personifies Tension,"The Town"" is directed, written and starred in by Ben Affleck. I do not particularly like Ben Affleck. I did not really think I would watch this film. However, when I found out that Jeremy Renner was in it, and with its positive word of mouth, I thought why not check it out.

""The Town"" is a crime drama set in the Charlestown area of Boston. The story though is not about the crimes per se, but about Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), the leader of this group of bank robbers. MacRay is tired of the life of crime he is in and wants to get out, but circumstances would not allow him to. When he develops an intimate relationship with Claire (Rebecca Hall), a bank manager of a bank they robbed, he gains further resolve to really get out of it all.

While Ben Affleck is still generally dull as the lead actor, he gets his cast to perform very well. Jeremy Renner, excellent as the loose cannon gang member Jem, commands the screen whenever he is in it. Even Gossip Girl Blake Lively unexpectedly turns in a gritty realistic performance as Jem's white trash sister.

The action sequences were topnotch. From the first bank robbery scene, then the breathtaking car chase following the second armored car hijack, to the final grand heist in old Fenway Park itself, all of these scenes were executed expertly with excitement and suspense. The best scene overall though was a quiet one, when Jem walks in on Doug and Claire having lunch is a masterpiece of tension. You can really sense the danger as Jem talks to Claire while Doug squirms in his seat.

Ben Affleck does better as director than actor in this. He gets the various elements of the film to cohere into a crisp and exciting final product. I did feel though that certain parts went a bit too long. Oscar nominations are already being predicted for this movie, but I think it is still too early to tell. However, Jeremy Renner seem to be a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor, at least as nominee. He personified that the tension essential to make this film work.",7
7 April 2020,"It's fine, but I'm disappointed","POSITIVES:

.Jon Hamm is great as always and should've been the lead in the film .Some good camerawork, no shaky cam or jump cuts

NEGATIVES:

.The bank robbers are meant to be the heroes but are all unlikable and I wanted them to get caught .The film opens with 4 screens of text and then narration; a big pet hate of mine .Some cringeworthy dialogue and obvious product placement e.g. multiple times instead of saying ""hand me your phone"" people say ""hand me your blackberry""

16 May 2023,A heist genre gem with great characters and clever twists and turns,"The Town (2010) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Hulu. The storyline follows a group of friends who grew up together in Boston. They have become family with integrated relatives, interests and hobbies. One of those hobbies is bank robbing. They are really good at it but the police are closing in on them after their most recent robbery where they took a hostage and left her behind alive. Now they need to observe her to see what she knows and if she can make them. Meanwhile, they plan their biggest heist yet. Have they bitten off more than they can chew or will their luck continue?

This movie is directed by and stars Ben Affleck (Argo) and also stars Jeremy Renner (Avengers), Blake Lively (Gossip Girl), Rebecca Hall (The Prestige), Jon Hamm (Mad Men), Chris Cooper (American Beauty) and Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects).

This movie is so well written. The sub plots, character development, dialogue and circumstances are very good. This felt a lot like Heat. The characters are very relatable and easy to root for, both the good and bad guys. The robbery and action scenes are tremendous. The cinematography is excellent and really captures the intensity of the circumstances. The final robbery is so well done and I loved the twist at the end.

12 July 2020,Excellent acting in this Town,"""The Town"" (2010) starring Ben Aleck, Jeremy Rener, Jon Hamm, and Blake Lively was awesome..It's about a group of Boston based bank robbers, their troubled lives, the FBI's pursuit and the blooming love relationship between one of the robbers and a bank employee who was victimized (Rebecca Hall) An very interesting character study. Excellent acting, especially Jeremy Renner, who was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar.

19 November 2019,Armored cars and Bank robbers from Charlestown!!!!,"Based on the Charlestown's armored cars and bank robberies background that put this Boston's neighborhood on the map of USA, Ben Affleck a native from there developed the whole project, letting to big screen a fabulous picture over this intriguing city overpowered by Irish ancestry, displays three robberies on the movie, all them in great style, thoroughly planned, action, chase, escaping on narrow streets provides an intense picture, the casting is another high point, mainly by the stunning performance by Jeremy Renner, also the breathtaking beauty of Rebecca Hall, Affleck shows your skills as actor and director, Also Jon Hamm as FBI agent, has a sub plot on Ben Affleck's father and how his mother leaves the house, fantastic picture, certainly the best of Affleck!!

25 September 2010,You are suppose to like it overrated,"This is one of those films that you are suppose to like. There is a buzz going around that tells everyone this is a good film. There a quite a few brutal scenes. And a couple of love scenes which are quick and well these are boring people in that department. All of the characters are mean in one way or another. The lead actress seems like she has a sinus condition. The acting is suppose to be great and dramatic but not in the same planet as Shutter Island acting wise.

There is a lot of meanness which doubles as realism. Johhny'y Depp's Dillinger film was far more interesting. In this film the bad guys almost are suppose to be good but they still are quite mean. Of course we have graphic scenes of where people are shot or close ups of beatings. That is the new realism. In the end there seems to be no point. It is in some ways TV like. Shows such as the Sopranos dwell on psychology and soap opera stories. Even the vaunted God Father was mostly talk. These films are not in the same league as the old Jimmy Cagney, Bogart, George Raft gangster films. Affleck is not in the same league as DI Caprio or Johnny Depp.

This film is way overrated.",5
24 August 2022,"Nice work, all around","Despite the general consensus (in my circles at least), I didn't get the ""Heat"" ripoff I'd expected. What I did get however, was a solid heist movie absolutely steeped in regional dialect and hometown pride. This is a Boston movie through and through and, while I can't say I've ever visited, I feel like I can still hear these characters' accents in my ear.

The requisite car chases and shootouts are present and accounted for, but this story seems more concerned with family, criminal heritage and wanting to break the cycle, which was a nice twist for such a well-trod subgenre. All of this is elevated by excellent performances - across the board - and some fine direction from Ben Affleck.

WE TRY TO TELL OUR FRIENDS THAT A CRITIC IS ONE PERSON, HE OR SHE IS NOT US. Critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear.

Therefore, our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theater. Many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing room.Not a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction. How can you review a movie without the real deal? What a great movie with a great cast of character actors from top to bottom. Ben does a great job in acting and directing.

We loved it and believe it is one of the best movies of 2010. It is a can't miss for anyone who likes to spend 2 hrs of pure enjoyment and an exciting and thrilling movie.

27 December 2010,The Town: 7/10,"This is Ben Affleck's sophomore film as a director, unlike its predecessor GONE BABY GONE (2007), this time he also takes the leading role. Generally speaking, I think Ben is on his way to become next Clint Eastwood and could be more appropriate as a director than an actor although he delivers a quite convincing performance most of the time, nevertheless, in a much more encouraging extent, this film delightedly proves that Ben Affleck is competent as a more versatile director.

The heist story can not be a novelty, the whole return of a prodigal son is a mere platitude, to my surprise I do enjoy the entire process although 150 minutes is a tad too long (I saw the DVD extended cut), the film has yet achieved a sparkling success on the box office, ($91,947,016, North American alone, which is a prodigious leap from GONE BABY GONE $20,300,218).

The shining star of the film is Jeremy Renner, given the fact that his role is a stereotyped bandit, but his portrayal endows his character a very intense collision against others (especially in a positive way to steal the thunder of poor Ben); Rebecca Hall again solidifies her status as the best among her peers, the sparks between her and Ben are adorable and make everything unbelievably convincing. Blake Lively also contributes her dramatic turn as a low-class prostitute with a baby girl; by contrast, Ben's acting is not worth mentioning.

The film is well-done from all aspects (particularly the cinematography and the rapid but precise editing), my only complain is that there is nothing new or ideographic from the genre, good luck on the Oscars next year!",7

15 January 2011,The Town: Boston must be the most dangerous place on earth.,"With intense stylized action and a suspenseful pace, ""The Town"" shows (once again) how gritty and violent life in Boston can be. In Ben Affleck's (Pearl Harbor) first attempt behind the camera, he seems to have struck gold doing what he does best, a film that highlights his home turf. Starring Jon Hamm (Mad Men), Rebecca Hall (Vicky Cristina Barcelona), Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker), Blake Lively (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants) and Affleck himself in the starring role, ""The Town"" continues the legacy of Boston crime genres. And the end result? Worth seeing, but not quite best picture award winning caliber. In fact, this is the type of movie that may alienate some viewers into thinking that maybe they didn't like it as much because they didn't grow up rooting for the Red Socks.

""The Town"" centers around what was said to have been one of the most crime ridden towns in America, Charlestown, Massachusetts. Doug MacRay (Affleck) and James Coughlin (Renner) were childhood friends and, as adults, are now apart of a long legacy of criminals to come out of Charlestown. After one bank robbery, in particular, MacRay becomes infatuated with the bank manager (Hall) and (what do you know) she happens to be the only one who can connect MacRay and Coughlin to the robbery. The one person who can send MacRay and Coughlin to prison for life, but will she do it? Or will love supersede all? Yeah, by the end this movie does get a little too sappy for its own good.

""The Town"" is a throw back to the look and feel of movies like ""Heat"" or ""Training Day"" (just not as developed as those examples). The problem here, aside from the so-so written script, is that half way through the film the love story between the bank manager and MacRay takes over the story. In saying that, this film is still worth seeing.

The huge buzz around this film may be because this is Affleck's directorial debut (yes, he should have been nominated for best director) and Jon Hamm's feature film debut (who is nothing special here. Do you hear what I said, all you fans of ""Mad Men""!?), but Renner and Lively are the real reasons for this films success. Lively gives a performance (as small as it is) that will remind audiences of how multi-faceted of an actress she is. As for Renner, he absolutely out acts everybody on screen. He needs to be nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor. If anything, he is better here than he was in ""The Hurt Locker"".

Final Thought: This may not be up to par with ""The Departed"" or movies of its own Bostonian crime genre, but I will say that for its few shortcomings ""The Town"" is the most underrated film of 2010. Affleck's directing style is that of a seasoned vet. The storyline may have turned from action film to melodrama all too easily for some who expected more action, but don't let that stop you from renting this very good film.

15 December 2010,Damn Good...,"Ben Affleck's 'The Town' is indeed a Damn Good Film. It's gripping, superbly directed, greatly acted & wonderfully photographed. Ben Affleck indeed has come out with a winner!

'The Town' is more of a complicated love-story. It's really not a story of a few robbers, nor about a man trying to clean up his deeds. It's a complicated love-story, where there so many obstacles around it. Ben Affleck goes into the zone of 'The Town' and makes sure he makes a memorable fare.

About a 124 minutes, the film never really loses you. The only moment when the screenplay gets a bit boring is in the middle, but makes up for it with a dramatic and captivating climax. Affleck rocks as a Storyteller, no doubts! He's made a fine film... and in each frame there is a visible stamp of the filmmaker. Bravo! A Special Mention to Robert Elswit, who has photographed the film with flourish.

In the acting department, Affleck, as an actor, also is in top form. One can easily state this performance amongst his best efforts. Jon Hamm is so natural in his part. Rebecca Hall is excellent. Blake Lively leaves a mark. Ditto for Chris Cooper. But the show truly belongs to Pete Postlethwaite & Jeremy Renner, who play their parts with unmatchable ease.

On the whole, visit this 'Town'... despite the violence around it. Recommended!",7

7 July 2018,Some flaws in credibility of the romantic story in this movie. But the heist part of this movie is tough and suspenseful. Sum total is entertaining.,"The story is about a town called Charlestown which is famous for being the birthplace of the largest number of robbers in the entire USA. This place spawns criminals like crazy. Ben Affleck is one of them, although he is the gentleman gangster, never killed someone, only has robbed some banks. The latest heist goes awry however and a guard is shot down. The police goes beserk and does everything in its power to apprehend the criminals at large. Will Ben Affleck succeed in pulling off the biggest heist without getting busted?

Movies got to be sold to the masses and I cant think of another reason that in most heist movies there always has to be a romantic story in order to lure the female audiences into buying a ticket. Can't image any guy wanting to see a romance in a tough heist movie. I dont have anything against romances, not even in heist movies, as long as the romantic story is credible. And it was NOT.

The somewhat flawed romantic story is about Ben Affleck, playing a bankrobber, who starts flirting with a female bankmanager of the place that he just robbed. That's just a lot of Hollywood romantic crap. The writer only puts something THIS much unbelievable in the story to sell tickets for females, who wanna drool over Ben Affleck. Females wont mind, guys probably will get anoyed by it somewhat.The rest of this movie is good though. Very good. The heist part of this movie is really tough and suspenseful. Coming close in true to life portrayal of gangster life in classics like ""Heat"" with Robert de Niro and Al Pacino and ""Training Day"", with Denzel Washington. These realistic supsenseful heist action scenes are what make this movie standout above the average heist movie. Acting in it is very very good. From leading characters (Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner) to some of the supporting actors, acting is on a level that really made me believe in the gangsters world that was portrayed in ""The Town"".

Sum total of this movie is pretty impressive, despite some flaws in the romantic story. If you just wanna see an entertaining action movie, then this hollywood formula film will certainly entertain. And there are some nice twists near the end that make this story surprising and very suspenseful. Too bad about the flawed romantic story, because the rest of this heist movie is really great.",8

13 February 2011,"Not good as ""Gone Baby Gone"" but still a solid movie","This film is basically a heist movie with romantic elements in it. This movie proves once again that Ben Affleck has more potential of directing movies than acting in one, he plays the main character in this but he is alright. Although most of the movies he starred in sort of sucked, Ben has a bit of talent for directing. I also enjoyed his past movie ""Gone Baby Gone"" which he directed and I enjoyed watching this movie as well, although I liked ""Gone Baby Gone"" more better. Mainly because it just had a tighter script and more original compared to this movie. The movie basically takes place in a town that is known for breeding bank robbers, and some are forced into it. But during one of the bank robbery, Ben Affleck's character Doug MacRay and his crew take a girl hostage. And later ends up falling for her while trying to spy on her cause the crew lives close by where she lives and maybe a threat to them. Now this plays a part in the story but the whole film doesn't necessarily revolve around this scenario, which is a good thing. Jeremy Renner did a great job in this movie as the loose cannon style of criminal who is also part of the crew. Jon Hamm also did a fabulous job of playing the rough and tough FBI, who play hard since the criminals play hard. Blake Lively was just hot in this, her acting is alright and that is all I can say for her. This is a pretty solid movie, nothing really refreshing or original but the script is still pretty good and I liked the direction and style of it all. The acting is superb and the cinematography is pretty good and has a bit of the ""Heat"" and ""Mystic River"" vibe to it. Oh and the chase scenes and the shoot outs is just amazing to watch, there is some parts that seem to drag a bit but that is about it.

21 November 2019,Somehow better than average,"There are so many films out there about gangs of bank robbers versus the law that it's hard to come up with anything vaguely different. And, to be fair, 'The Town' doesn't really succeed. Now, although that may sound like a 'down-point,' despite its mediocre premise, it's actually quite good (if you're into gritty bank robbing films, anyway).

Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner play the lead bank robbers, while Jon Hamm heads up the FBI task force whose job it is to bring this particular gang to justice in Boston, which is - apparently - the city in America with the most bank robberies in the country.

Again, it's weird, but I can't really think of many major plus points. Yes, the lead cast are pretty 'A-list' (plus you have Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively and Pete Postlethwaite) to add to the heavyweights, but the story really is so little new that I don't understand quite why I like it so much!

I hear the original cut was around a massive four hours and director (also Ben Affleck) had to work hard to trim down the final edit to slightly under two hours. You may think that such a drastic loss would mean that it all feels really rushed. But, again, it doesn't.

There's just something about the film that really does work, even though it never really brings much that's new to the table. Personally, I really enjoyed Jon Hamm's performance, but it was Jeremy Renner who received a nod to an Academy Award for his supporting portrayal of a Boston gangster.

If you like your gangster films dark, gritty and - strangely - watchable, then you should definitely give this one a go. At least then if you like it I'll know it's not just me.",8

2 August 2011,heist movie with a good story line,"This movie was above your average heist movie because the characters are a little more developed and the culture of their Boston neighborhood are brought into the movie. It is more than just watching how they are going to pull off the ultimate robbery. Doug is the head of the gang. He's smart and not a hot head like James. You know James' impulsiveness is going to come back and bite them in the bud.

So, they take a bank employee, Claire, as a hostage and decide to follow up and make sure she doesn't know anything. Doug ends up starting a relationship with her, but she doesn't know he was one of her robbers. As the movie goes along, the cops are getting closer as the gang continues to pull off robberies. The ending was neat with Doug surviving a seemingly impossible situation and helping Clarie in the end. However, I think the police would be very suspicious about a large cash donation being made in Doug's mother's name. I would think that cash would be confiscated by the police.

FINAL VERDICT: Check it out.

14 December 2010,Tense and Brilliant!,"After Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck comes again with another film, and with only two films under his belt, he proves he has great talent behind (and in front) of the camera.

I have never really had respect for Affleck as an actor, but I realize that the reason is probably because of the films he comes out in, not because of his actual acting ability. I knew he made a very good film in 2007, but here he made a great one. He is able to direct this story magnificently well, and also direct himself and the entire ensemble cast, which is full of great performances, most notably Renner and Affleck himself. The film has great writing, directing, acting, and is very tense and entertaining, and also has characters you are able to invest in. It reminds me of 2006's The Departed.

Overall, this was a great film, and I do not really have any criticisms. I am very much looking forward to more of Affleck's directorial works, and The Town is as of now one of the best films of the year.

17 December 2010,The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Town

The hardest part of robbing banks nowadays is getting the ATM to get down on the ground and to stop looking at your face.

Fortunately, the armed robbers in this heist picture decided to jack the driver of an armored car instead.

Born into a life of crime, constant companions Doug (Ben Affleck) and Jem (Jeremy Renner) mature into seasoned bank robbers. On their most recent job, however, Doug's professionalism begins to slip.

Assigned to shadow a bank teller (Rebecca Hall) that they used as a hostage, Doug inadvertently falls in love.

Meanwhile, a tenacious FBI agent (Jon Hamm) draws ever closer to the boys' identities.

Directed by Ben Affleck, The Town seems like a typical bank job movie, however, familiar fissures in the friendship and promises of ""one last time"" are accentuated by bold performances and puissant gunplay.

To quell further robberies, banks need to start dispensing nickels only. (Green Light)",7

Afleck seems mostly preoccupied with getting the Boston accent down, with the result being a monotonous performance. Hamm does his acting through his stubble. Renner comes off best, playing Afleck's hot-tempered buddy. It's illogical that Afleck would become romantically involved with a woman that he held hostage. The action scenes feel stale and drawn out.

16 March 2011,"Intelligent drama combining an engaging romance with a police investigation and a criminal gang's disenchantment with one another, culminating in a thoroughly competent piece.","Some extraordinary statistics greet us upon the beginning of Ben Affleck's film The Town, statistics more broadly linked to that of career choices those whom inhabit the film's set city of Boston are seemingly limited to. Specifically, if you're not a criminal or a thief or an armoured truck targeting bandit then there aren't many other things that you are. Like the lone monument, or cenotaph, which is the first image we see, standing tall amidst a sky full of clouds eerily rushing by, it is a career choice placed at the forefront of a sea of despair or despondency; a lifestyle perpetrated by a gloomy backdrop within which it seems there is precious little choice. Affleck's film is a studious observation on the limits a group of men face in this regard, a team of crooks who take down various instalments of cash held within banks and other such places connected to that of money exchange; people that are caught up in this city and this choice of life, again amidst a dank and unwelcoming backdrop of despair. The pillar appears as more than scant iconography, it is an item Affleck utilises and revisits on a number of occasions in the form of inserting it back into proceedings as characters progress and appear to want to escape onto something else; that monument coming and coming again as the insatiable force that is 'the life' drags our man backwards and backwards and back into the mire of it all.

Affleck here assumes the role of young Irish-American crook Doug MacRay; a young, pent-up but brutally methodical young heister with a father in prison, a mother, who he holds bittersweet memories of, whom is dead and is currently stuck in what is an unnurtured and unfulfilling relationship with a co-worker's sister named Krista (Lively). MacRay is involved in a crew with three others, one of which is Jeremy Renner's James Coughlin, of whom is the more sociopathic and violent of the group; a man whose credentials and legal situation in that he is a step away from serious penal related consequences is later verbally highlighted to us by the authorities. With Coughlin and MacRay is Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Burke), whom form the rest of the gang. Their jolting introduction is the robbing of a bank in masks and cloaks which typify evil in their demonic appearance; the preceding sequence as they go over things one final time complete with intense contingencies allowing for brief glances over one or two of the men as trepidation creeps sparingly over their faces and we're informed that here is a film not preoccupied with the slam-bang thrill of a robbery or a heist pertained by just anybody, but a group of men thinking and cultivating something through.

Ensuing complications during the opening sees English actress Rebecca Hall's bank employee Claire Keesey taken hostage, her frightful reaction to the F.B.I.'s questioning firmly establishing how deeply the experience affected her and as of the moment tags the crooks with an easy labelling of blind to all emotion, nameless, anonymous thugs without much due concern to others. The film goes some lengths to deconstruct this notion, a getting under of the proverbial skin and demythifying the gangsters whilst keeping all the police procedural stuff led by John Hamm's agent Adam Frawley deliberately quick; methodical; cold; metallic and emotionally lacking. As we come to bond more with MacRay, as he himself infiltrates Keesey's life on his crew's orders to check up on her problematic relationship in regards to them, we come to somewhat reverse our view to form more of an understanding with him; his life and their intimate bond. An early incident in their relationship sees MacRay utilise his criminal mindset to get one back on a group of hoodlums whom previously wronged Keesey, challenging us to get behind Affleck's character and exemplifying his disdain towards such people as officers of the law stay stuck on the back-burner going through the motions.

The film is rich in its finer things. Pete Postlethwaite delivers a stern and aggressive, in all the right ways, performance as local mob boss Fergus Colm, who has seen mostly everything and now works out of a florists. There is an affecting sub-plot to do with MacRay coming to tie up a bond with his father, who himself offers a further example of the film's demythification element when he confirms to our Doug that his mother was nary the proverbial angel he always saw her as - thus underpinning the film's core thesis. There is also a quite wonderful sequence between two characters, one overly violent and whose background at this point is occupied by deathly gravestones in a cemetery,; the other, having reiterated his desire to leave this life behind, shot to a backdrop of a community centre suggesting a straighter, more legitimate desire for a lifestyle possibly in which the helping of others features. Sadly, all appears lost and the brawling results in the would-be 'straighter' of the two men quite literally being dragged back to the 'side' of the nastier criminal: graveyard infused background et al.

People are surprised at the competence of director Ben Affleck, here doubling up as the co-screenwriter as well. Glancing back at Affleck's acting credits, the man has most certainly worked with some well known and rather well renowned directors of both his and our time; John Woo and Frankenheimer on some occasions, the likes of Gus van Sant, Martin Brest and, while there are many more people who admire him than I do, Kevin Smith on others. It's true to say that he hasn't necessarily caught the majority of these director's during either of their finest hours, or indeed worked with them on their best work, but if the man has observed and listened and formulated the ideas and methods that he's most probably put into practise for something such as The Town, then who's complaining?",7
5 December 2010,"The Town, Great Movie!","You know not allot of people say that they are excited to see a movie, but I was extremely excited for this movie to come out, since the get -go. I thought I would ruin the film for me if I continued to watch trailers and behind the scenes, but honestly it didn' reveal anything to me. I was excited for many reason's, one because my second favorite actor Jeremy Renner is in this film, I haven't seen Ben Affleck for a while, and it was from the producers of ""The Departed.""

The Town is an instant classic in my book. There were no mistakes through out the progression of the film. John Hamm was perfect in his role as FBI Agent Adam Frawley. There was some comedy in the film that I enjoyed, and the good thing is that the comedy did not ruin the film. There are also some many twists and turns in the film that you have to pay attention to the film. The film has many genres, love, deceit, action, drama, and adventure.

The basic gist of the story is Ben Afflecks character, Doug MacRay is trying to get out of the robbing business, he had been grown up with because of his father Stephen MacRay (Chris Cooper). Although he wants to get out he has to face many obstacles, like family, friends, FBI, and fellow robbers. James Coughlin (James Renner) is the major factor in preventing Doug from leaving the mob. He is the loose cannon, who just wants to rob rob rob.

I loved this film, I truly believe it is one of the best films made in 2010. I would rate this with a solid 10 out of 10 stars for all the effort put into the film. One last thing I want to comment on is the gun fight towards the end. It was great because they included no music to make the fight seem more realistic, which I thought was a great idea. Now allot of people will say the just wanted to copy the gun fight in the movie Heat. I think they didn't, but if they did, they did a hell of a better job than Heat did so yeah I loved this film.",10
19 April 2017,Ben does it again,"You can't fault a movie made by Ben Affleck. He makes good movies every time. He never drops his guard, you could say. This second outing, that should of had a better title, becomes an engaging watch, like his other films, the second half more exciting. Set in Charleston, where the movie Slapshot was set, he heads a band of top line thieves, who've got their s..t together, the way they immaculately work, when taking down this bank, is professionalism at a frightening level. Only they make one mistake, they take a female employee hostage, for some reason, none other than Affleck getting a hard on (again, don't let your d..k run your life). He strikes up a romance with her, while initially tailing her, and sussing her out, as if getting confirmation, that she doesn't recognize his voice. Hey it's a small town and the town di.ks led by a real d..k (a riveting Hamm), who we want Affleck to beat, are quickly on to them, as the robber's locale is within four blocks of the victim's place. Affleck becomes quickly swayed from getting out of this business, and leaving his ex, (a fantastic Blake Lively) the town pump you could say and kid, and taking off with his new found love. The acting really impressed and surprised me, with this movie. Renner, Cooper, and Pete Postlewaite, a really nasty piece of work, who've owned Affleck and his family, he was the icing on the cake. The shootout, heading towards it's climactic end, where Aflleck has cornered into doing another job was beautiful, and so was his fate. Even the masks and hold up garb is impressive- scary nun wear. Like Clooney, Affleck acts better in films he directs, and I have not yet seen The Accountant. In no way, is he the best actor here, him, falling somewhere near the middle amidst this high calibre pool of actors. I'm so glad I caught, this movie. It is kind of overlong, but I really don't see that as a qualm, with a film like this, boosted by engaging performances and a quite simplistic though well worked story. If only for a better title, which a movie as good as this much better title rethink. Five days past, and I'm still thinking about this film. Good stuff Ben.",8
19 November 2018,But I know I'll see you again. This side or the other.,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",9
1 January 2011,Ben Affleck is Our New Respectable Director,"If you think Ben Affleck is a great Actor, you should take a better look at ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997). If you think Ben is a great Screenwriter, you should see ""The Town"" more thoroughly. In thiz last movie, he also becomes the Director. For me, Ben is the third talented Actor-Director in the past decade, beside Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson. Thiz is his second long feature after respectable ""Gone Baby Gone"" in 2007. The town is Charleston Boston, where everybody knows everybody. It revolves around the bank thief Doug (Ben Affleck), his partner in crime James (Jeremy Renner), along with their former hostage Claire (Rebecca Hall) who will be having a love affair with Doug later, and a FBI agent Adam (John Hamm). All of them get tangled into a cat and mouse situation. First half of the movie, it introduces the characters and situations. Then the second half, it flips over nicely by explaining the motives behind those characters. I think Ben is success with his directing method because he does not exaggerate things up, he just let every thing flows naturally. Yes, he plays save here. The factors that empower thiz movie are simply a good script and consistent Actor performances. Ben himself shows a very calm and convincing performance. As well Rebecca Hall as his love interest, Hall delivers a precise fragile and lovable character. Jeremy Renner is deathly awesome with his street gang attitude. Most of the supporting Cast members deserve honorable mentions as well. Blake Lively as Doug's ex-girlfriend and single parent, I have never seen Lively blends into thiz kind of troubled character. Chris Cooper as Doug's behind-the-cell father, it takes only one scene but it's definitely memorable. And the last but not least for me, it's Pete Postlethwaite as Fergie the flower man who is the brain behind the crime. There is strange feeling by only hearing his intimidate and unique accent. In the end, we realize that the town could change people, and the people are just victims. It's harder to change the system than the person itself. But to change the system, it should start by changing the person as well. And thiz will be a never-ending circle. But finally, it's totally out of our control. But we can control something for sure, for me it's waiting for another Ben Afflecks's next project. I will see him again, on thiz side or the other.

4 March 2020,'The Town' is brilliant,"'The Town' is brilliant.

Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner play the respective roles of Doug and Jem tremendously, while the plot is well written and the music is fitting. A few of the other crew members are perhaps underdeveloped, but that's my only issue with this film - and it's not even a notable one.

And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",10
21 October 2010,"Contrived, Hackneyed, Schmaltzy, Conventional, Spectacularly Entertaining","There are certain scenes in The Town that skillfully use the psychological commands we insistently hurl at movie characters. For instance, Ben Affleck's fond of Rebecca Hall. If she sees the tattoo on the back of Renner's neck, she'd find out something she can't find out about him. Jeremy Renner without warning meets the two at a counter. With firm looks and behavior, Affleck hints at him to leave. We do, too. Renner aggressively loiters. He doesn't know the tattoo's a tell. If a film can carry us to this situation and make us feel angst, it's done something correctly. Nevertheless, the dialogue so often feels forced, especially in the film's mid-section. John Hamm is given many lines that act more as self-conscious metaphors and similes---""This isn't Tommy Hopscotch anymore,"" or ""This is the not-effing-around crew so get me something that looks like a print because this not-effing-around thing is about to go both ways""---than as steps to create tension or reveal character. Affleck's alternately somber and confrontational monologues are either too affected to be taken seriously or they're beautifully written and delivered but nevertheless not motivated enough to feel any more than contrived, just as much of the plot is.

The Town opens by directly informing us that Charlestown breeds more bank robbers than anywhere else in the entire world. But rather than showing us real people, we're given crime drama stereotypes, in thrall to a mawkishly sentimental formula. Affleck is the leader of the heist crew with a heart and a burdened conscience who becomes romantically linked with an idealized female figure of innocence, played by Hall, whose personal life seems to only be comprised of volunteering to help children and do earnest day-to-day activities, all purely incidental in order to serve Affleck's character arc. She doesn't seem to have a life of her own at all. The crew's second banana is Renner's unhinged, trigger-happy urban barbarian with an insular sense of honor among criminals. The crew is comprised of two other neighborhood guys as well, but we're given nothing about them at all. We see them intermingle, we see the foursome masked while performing spectacular robberies, but nothing that ultimately happens to these other two matters. They work for Pete Postlethwaite, the emblematic neighborhood old-timer who keeps the subsequent generation's angry young men bound to the eponymous segregated populist environment to do his dirty work.

But The Town is not a bad film. It may be hackneyed, schmaltzy and conventional, but as Ebert once intelligently observed, what makes a movie good is not what it's about but how it's about it. It's certainly not as gritty as its opening words oblige, nor is it exceptional as a crime drama unattached to those words about Charlestown, but don't we watch those gangster films from the 1930s and '40s with the same trite, ham-handed and forcibly conformist scripts, Cagney, Bogart and Robinson spouting the same artificially prosey lines, and enjoy them to the point of rapture? Nostalgia, right? Well that's just what Affleck is going for with The Town: An atmospherically nostalgic, sentimentally driven elegy to the narrow streets of Boston. And in that subjective milieu, it's a very absorbing, highly adventurous entertainment.

Something else that observant movie buffs admire about silver-screen gangster classics, but regard less about more modern films with the same dramatic tackiness listed above, is the technical structure. As over-the-top and ham-handed as White Heat, High Sierra and the great original Scarface are, especially by modern standards, they're shot, edited and directed with more than a deft hand for tension and brutal in-the-moment action. So is Affleck's The Town. For the first half hour, it's edited with a particular, emotional and suspenseful edge that not many romantic Hollywood films are. Of the many impacts provided by the overtonal and associational cutting is its dropping of us, the audience, straight into the initial dilemma of the story. And as the film progresses, there is the occasional suggestive use of editing, not just manipulating the temporal length of the cuts or its rhythmic characteristics, but to elicit a reaction from the audience even more complex than from cutting simply based on the length of a shot or the literal connection from one situation to the next.

The most spectacular entertainment to extract from the movie in terms of narrative are certainly the heists, their getaways and repercussions. The robbery sequences themselves pull few punches. I've often wondered what security guards, law enforcement, bank employees and the like think and feel when faced with films like Ocean's Eleven and The Italian Job. Are they especially detached from the exhilarating spectacle of a witty machination like that, or do they sometimes actually resent the sugar-coated treatment of the sort of experience they've either had or fear to have? The Town is one of those heist films that maintain both the rush of a good movie heist sequence and the ferocity of the armed robbery of an establishment.",7
22 March 2022,Mind blown,"The movie blew my mind in an empty small theatre called Gaeity Galaxy in mumbai on a sick day when I watched it alone. It just comes alive unexpectedly when you least expect it to like when the police come for the thieves and they make plans for when they would be in jail. Or when Affleck casually tells the detective how recognizable their surveillance car was. Have rewatched it 5x and still enjoy it.

20 October 2010,Affleck delivers both behind and in front of the camera,"Riveting, well-acted cops and robbers crime saga set in the heart of working-class Boston. Doug MacRay, blithely following in the footsteps of his imprisoned, lowlife father, has lived in the clannish neighborhood of Charlestown his entire life and become the brains behind a gang of slick thieves who always get away clean. Doug wants to make a fresh start and put the town he's always known in his rear view mirror, but things get sticky when he falls for the bank manager of his last heist with the feds quickly closing in. Pulls you in from the moment it starts with vivid, one of a kind scenery, all-too-believable characters, and skillful action scenes that are able to create genuine tension and excitement. Echoes Michael Mann's classic genre film Heat, yet still an impressive showing in its own right for Affleck as lead actor, director, and co-writer, creating a worthy follow-up to Gone Baby Gone and adding another memorable addition to the ""Boston crime"" genre. Renner is especially potent as Affleck's volatile right-hand man. ***

2 February 2017,One of the worst movies I've seen in years,"This movie sucked so much that I decided to write a review. Oh my god, I don't know where to start. I don't know if there is such award as Anti-Oscar. Probably, there is, because creators obviously were trying to win it in all nominations possible. Worst actor/actress, worst screenplay, worst movie, worst movie of all time, worst movie of all time and space.

It is like Ben Affleck was thinking: OK you don't like how I act? I can make you suffer even more! I will make my own movie with blackjack and hookers! You will PLEAD me to ACT, so that I didn't have time to MAKE movies! Ha-ha-ha!!!

I was watching this movie, waiting for two hours: now scenario will twist and the action will become interesting, suddenly I will see all previous BS in a new light, -- I was telling myself. Nope. Here's how you should watch this movie: watch first five minutes, then assume continuation in most beaten, in most Hollywood-cliché way, -- and it's like you've seen the entire movie. I've just saved you 2 hours of your life. You are welcome.",2
8 July 2013,Hats and masks off to Affleck.,"A lifetime Charlestown, Boston crook falls in love with the bank teller of his last 'job' only to find himself forced to carry out one last heist to ensure her safety.

In the vein of Heat (1995), Ben Affleck directs and stars in this gritty, stripped back heist movie. Smartly limiting the gimmicky use of the Point Break (1991) robber mask idea The Town delivers a realistic yarn with its on location look.

The cast give good performances although it may have befitted from Affleck being totally behind the camera. The late great Pete Postlewaite briefly appears, Jeremy Renner is edgy as Coughlin and plays against typecast, while love interest Rebecca Hall gives a weighty performance both Blake Lively and Jon Hamm as Special Agent Adam Frawley are notable.

Thankfully this has very little Hollywood gloss and tries to avoid clichés wherever possible. It's more drama than action with some tension driven shootout scenes littered thought.

The Town may not define the genre, but certainly it proves that Affleck can direct and deliver a solid piece of entertainment. Surprisingly recommended.",
26 February 2019,Hello darkness my old friend / boring,"Incredibly overrated movie... I don't care who directed this movie, if this movie was directed by Kubrick even then it would get 3. So in this case it was Affleck and guess what? he was in leading role and guess what movie was boring... Whitch actually describes Affleck really good :) anyway, unrealistic movie where police are random man from casting agency who are doing all to help bank robers. And after some intense scenes there are 15min of boring talks about Affleck grandmother. And offcorse, movie is predictable from first 10min.Don't waste time.

26 May 2023,"The plot of ""The Town"" obvious, the ""human"" portrayal of the characters also brings a certain difference, since it does not focus only on robberies or criminal plans","In 1998, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for Good Will Hunting. Many years later, only in 2007, did the star return to work behind the camera, but this time as a director, in the excellent ""Gone Baby Gone"". Returning in the same role, Affleck does not deviate much from what he already knows where he had worked in his first film, the city of Boston, which is also his hometown and the scene of great police films.

There, it is where the best bandits live, the most intelligent and who understand the ""business"", it works like tradition, passing the gifts from father to son, forming gangs feared by the population, recognized among the dangerous and pursued by police. Among these gangs is that of Doug (Ben Affleck) and his friend Jem (Jeremy Renner), who work together competently in big robberies. Behold, they went to rob a bank, masked, and get out of control, taking a hostage, the manager Claire (Rebecca Hall), just to scare her. However, they realize she's seen too much and could end it all with a simple report, as soon as the FBI is on her tail. Determined to stop this, Doug goes after Claire, just as Doug, a simple stranger, makes easy friends and he ends up realizing how much that irresponsible act affected her life. The problem is that he ends up falling in love and this unlikely union ends up making him reflect on his life and whether this is exactly what he wants to live for, and he is divided between which side he should remain. However, the choice will not be so easy, as soon as abandoning his friend is out of the question, as Jem insists on reminding him that because of him he spent nine years in prison and that this debt has not yet been paid.

It's hard to understand so much praise from American critics regarding this project by Ben Affleck as director, because at no time is the story able to seem interesting enough, especially for the spectator who is used to the genre. The film's introduction implies that there will be some scathing social criticism, or a deeper analysis of Charlestown, the Boston neighborhood that serves as the setting. Right from the start, information about the community appears on the screen, known for being the place where most bank robberies happen, a habit taught from father to son.

Thus, the gang led by Doug MacRay (played by Affleck) is soon shown in action, but the didacticism of the scene is very harmful. To enable the story to unfold, Affleck positions his camera, at a certain point, in order to make it clear to the audience his intention to highlight the tattoo of Jem, Doug's partner played by Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker""). The reason is obvious: if the most unsuspecting spectator does not notice this detail, half the plot disappears. At the same time, Affleck's heavy hand at this point takes away the viewer's enjoyment of having their own insights. After the opening scene, which is assumed to be much more interesting than it actually is, the wait remains for the evident moment of tension arising from the meeting between Jem and the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), taken hostage by the group after the action. Another apparent lack of subtlety by Affleck in directing, and also in the script co-written by him, is the whisper that his character gives in the ear of the manager. At that very moment, the first thing that comes to mind is: ""she will recognize his voice later on"". At least in that regard, Affleck's tirade is astute, but even so, he can't escape the predictability of why each event in the bank robbery action.

In the sequence, Affleck still tries to give a serious tone when flirting with the interesting reflection of the victim who falls in love with his kidnapper. But his passage through Stockholm Syndrome is empty, even more so because the reciprocal, of the assailant who quickly becomes interested in the target, makes it seem like a litany subtracted from impossible romances. In this way, the story takes a new turn: how to make the romance between two people with such different lifestyles viable? ""The Town"", then, becomes the conflict of a character who intends to change his way of life, but, at the same time, does not want to betray the friendship of his friends, mainly because of past debts. Until then, the impression of obviousness reigns and this tendency continues until the end, mainly with the supposedly intelligent ideas that only repeat old formulas. Jon Hamm plays the FBI agent responsible for leading the hunt for the gang. But the way in which the script facilitates or hinders the police's work to satisfy the interest of continuing with a story that increasingly deviates from reality is depressing.

There is nothing about ""The Town"" that is unpredictable. The arc of the repentant bandit, who decides to leave his place because it is the place with the greatest bad influence, never changes. Here we have all the elements of a heist movie mixed with romance: the bandit falls in love with a woman who was involved in a robbery, he wants to leave his old life to start a new one with her, but for that he needs to perform one last act before the final redemption. The big difference from ""The Town"" is that there isn't that whole section explaining all the planning of the robberies, as in ""Ocean's Eleven"" and the like, creating a greater expectation of what could happen. In addition, the film has the merit of humanizing the characters, the residents of the small-town look like true modern American rednecks (was Affleck's broken tooth part of the ""makeup""?).

Affleck continues to be a struggling actor, with the benefit of having good supporting actors under his command, like Jeremy Renner, in the (also compulsory) role of the crazy best friend who keeps dragging the protagonist back to crime, or Blake Lively, as the former girlfriend who physically embodies all the corrupted habits Doug wants to break free of. With reservations made, Ben Affleck proves to be a competent director of action scenes (although the addiction of heist films to always commit one last blow makes ""The Town"" a little longer than it should) and obviously has, by affinity, a good eye for filming Boston, their faces and their accents. The Catholic influence in the city is felt without being heavy (in the meeting of narcotics anonymous, in the disguises of a nun) and the clever way in which the previous history is revealed - in two levels glued together, first Doug talking about his family to Claire, then the FBI exposing the ""B side"", with the family record - does not let the narrative become trivial. A very interesting point in ""The Town"" is the emphasis that, no matter how safe and planned a security system is, its weakest point will always be the human factor. What's the use of a super special door that only opens with very specific keys, if the family of whoever has the key is threatened and at the same time its holder opens the door?

In the end, ""The Town"" isn't even an ingenious film about bank robbery like ""Inside Man"", for example. In reality, Ben Affleck's film is more concerned with drawing a dramatic line between the characters who get involved, as victims or villains, in these criminal situations. With that, it gains negative and positive points. The script stumbles when it falls into some clichés like the villain who, anonymously, does something terrible to the girl, but then starts to have a relationship with her and regrets the mistakes he made. At the same time that it makes the plot of ""The Town"" obvious, the ""human"" portrayal of the characters also brings a certain difference to the production, since it does not focus only on robberies or criminal plans.

Conducted safely, ""The Town"" may not be a very original film, but it has many interesting aspects. If Ben Affleck's direction is possibly the greatest of them, we cannot fail to mention, of course, the good group of actors that are gathered here. Ben Affleck, in addition to directing, also stars in the story. I still have some difficulties accepting him as an actor, but it's clear that he seems more confident in that regard. However, the other actors manage to achieve greater notoriety, especially the always satisfying Rebecca Hall. The result, therefore, is an entertainment that is objective and, in a way, structurally common. But what matters is that the result works very well.",6
23 December 2010,"Familiar, but very well done","A strong, fun and very well detailed crime thriller, but not nearly as subtle or emotionally and morally complex as Affleck's earlier 'Gone Baby Gone'. There's a lot of cliché's here, especially in the third act; car chases, huge over-the-top .shootouts which, while well handled, make this feel much more like a familiar Hollywood movie. Also, some of the supporting characters fall into 'types' we've seen so many times before, something 'Gone Baby Gone' generally avoided very well, despite being a hard boiled detective thriller, hardly an under-done genre. Indeed, a lot of this film, including the main plot itself treads familiar water, but it does it with enough grown up intelligence, good acting, and specificity to let us get caught up anyway. And at least, by the end a few of the 'obvious' set ups, have led us somewhere different than the standard Hollywood treatment would lead us to expect.

I just hope Affleck, an obviously extremely talented film-maker, returns to the kind of thematically richer and more original material he mined in his first film.",7
8 January 2011,Affleck is now two for two as a director,"¨I will see you; this side or the other. ¨ Many critics thought that Ben Affleck's successful directorial debut in Gone Baby Gone could have to do with beginners luck, but he proved them otherwise with The Town because he has made one of the best films of the year once again. He has managed to go two for two now and is beginning to prove he may have a better career as a director than an actor. Affleck has brought us one of the best crime thrillers of the decade; I was completely hooked from the very beginning with the heist and chase scenes as well as with the characters. The movie has several tense scenes that will have you at the edge of your seat, and at the same time very well developed characters with good dialogues thanks to a smart script adapted by Affleck himself and a good performance from the entire cast. The screenplay was adapted from Chuck Hogan's novel ¨Prince of Thieves¨ and besides Affleck, Aaron Stockard and Peter Craig collaborated with the adaptation. The screenplay was very well adapted although it differs from the novel in the ending. Affleck also stars in this film and he does a pretty good job, but who really steals the show is Jeremy Renner as the secondary character. The rest of the cast also have an above average performance: Blake Lively, Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, and the late Pete Postlethwaite all give very memorable performances thanks to the solid material they had to work with. Affleck seems to bring the best out of each actor as a director and he has proved he has a very promising career ahead of himself if he continues at this pace.

As in Affleck's other film the story takes place once again in Boston. Charlestown is a neighborhood known for producing the most blue collar bank robbers in the world. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) have all grown up together in Charlestown and are no exception to the rule. Together they have managed to pull off a series of armored vehicles and bank robberies throughout Boston under Doug's leadership. They receive tips from a florist owner known as Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) who has controlled the neighborhood for years. During their latest bank robbery things go wrong and they are forced to take the bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage before letting her go unharmed once they have escaped. Things begin to get complicated once James realizes that Claire lives in their same neighborhood and fears she might have seen something. Doug decides to follow her around to make sure she doesn't suspect anything and in doing so they begin to develop a friendship. James would much rather get rid of her because he doesn't want to risk their cover, but Doug has fallen for her and wants to change his life around. Doug will soon discover that getting out of a life of crime will be more difficult than he ever could have imagined. Doug's other concern is that the FBI is close on their tail and they are receiving a lot of heat from S.A. Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and his partner Dino (Titus Welliver).

The Town is a very tense and gripping movie that manages to balance well crafted suspenseful crime scenes with well developed characters and a good script that adds some emotional drama to the action sequences. It is hard to avoid comparisons between this movie and Michael Mann's Heat since every successful crime film can be compared to that one, the best of its genre. Ben Affleck is turning into a great director and is perhaps doing something similar for Boston to what Woody Allen and Spike Lee do for New York. There is no denying Affleck also has talent as a screenwriter since he won an Oscar for his work with Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting, and Gone Baby Gone was also a really good adaptation. Crime thrillers are one of my favorite genres in film and it has been awhile since I have enjoyed one as much as I did with The Town. It has great action scenes that feel real and interesting characters. Jeremy Renner is really on a hot streak following up on his Oscar nominated performance for The Hurt Locker. In this movie he is once again the highlight of the film. Blake Lively also gave a terrific performance as an alcoholic and drug addict mother from Charlestown who has a casual relationship with Doug. Her Boston accent was right on the mark. The entire cast was great in this film. I really enjoyed this film and consider it to be one of the best of 2010 along with Inception.

18 August 2014,Entertaining crime drama,"In Boston, a gang of four masked guys rob a bank. The manager is an attractive girl. One of the guys is rather kind to her but takes her after the robbery blindfolded and drops her off somewhere. Behind this group is an Irish florist who finds the jobs and assigns them to these guys.

After the job, the guy, Doug, follows the manager around and invites her for a drink. They become close.

The FBI investigates and quickly discovers the identity of one of them and quickly also discovers the whole crew. But they don't have a case against them. No evidence was left behind. The only information they have is the tattoo that the girl saw on the back of the neck of one of the guys. That would be James, Doug's best friend. James killed someone for Doug and now Doug owes him. He is also involved with James' sister and treats her child as if it were his.

Now that he's met this girl, Doug is getting reluctant to do criminal work. Still, he takes the next job, robbing an armored car. He is worried because one of the guys is ex-military and trained. Still, James keeps the pressure up reminding Doug about the guy he killed for him. So Doug accept. This time around violence ensues. The cops chase them but they manage to escape. The FBI interviews them but lets them go.

Doug tells the florist he's out, no more jobs. But the florist threatens the girl so he accepts one more job. The FBI meanwhile discovers about the relationship between Doug and the girl and they let her know who he really is. The crew robs the vault at a stadium and on their way out they run into heavily armed FBI.

The Town is a strong crime action drama very much in the vein of Heat but set in Charlestown. Doug is the brains of the operation, James the violent one. We learn some background about Doug, his criminal dad and his disappeared mother. All the heists are exciting and well-filmed. Some of the drama and family business is very cliché. This is review based on the short version of the film. Too much attention is placed on Doug, who isn't really all that interesting and doesn't appear to be all that bright either. We learn little about the other two members of the crew nor about the FBI and their investigation. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't go into depth either about what causes Charlestown to be the source of most bank and armored car robbers.",8
19 July 2022,Solid yet unspectacular heist movie,"Builds tension well and has exciting action scenes that will keep you entertained. But ultimately it is rather unremarkable and fails to stick out as anything that hasn't been done before. If it wasn't for the climax of the movie, I'd say this is worth skipping.

27 September 2021,Where's the line between right and wrong?,"The movie portrays a hardcore criminal as loving and caring gentleman with a decent heart. These people have no hesitation to take money from others. When cornered, they have no hesitation to kill. Even if they have a soft side towards their loved ones, they are still threats and cancers of the society. So what's the film maker's purpose of this movie? Just make a movie as long as it can bring in profit? Now the line between the film makers and criminals is becoming blurry.

14 December 2011,The Town (2010),"Affleck's follow up to Gone Baby, Gone is both a successful heist drama and a disappointment. Affleck certainly loves his home, once again exploring Boston with a lot of love and attention for detail. I had trouble connecting to the love of where you're from/grew up, as this seems to be a very American sensibility. I doubt anywhere is as closed minded as somewhere in this film, but I'll take Affleck's word for it. The film also seems to be lingering around Heat territory for far too long. Affleck and Renner are just too different to really care. Affleck is the sweet criminal, and Renner is the sociopath. Drawing the parallels between them just makes you question why they were ever friends. What the film does achieve is showing Affleck as a director with an excellent eye on style and pacing. He shoots the character driven scenes with just as much attention and thought as he does the action scenes. Gone Baby, Gone was a real grower for me and I hope The Town will be the same.

15 May 2011,This is the ONLY correct review. Read it all and you will agree. I promise.,"Sorry critics, Its not even subjective in this case. This is the ONLY right answer. If you read it all you will agree. I promise. Honestly I hope someone replies to this and proves me wrong because I am tired of feeling this much anger over a stupid movie. Here's an in depth analyst of why this is the worst movie I have ever seen.

Its the worst story I have ever seen in a movie since pre 9/11. This movie's heroes shoot at cops, attempt to kill the innocent do-gooders, and take advantage of peoples love for their families for their own personal gain. I only watched the last few scenes so I could watch ben affleck get shot in the face and I got nothing except him on a balcony over a swamp at sunset reflecting over his life as if he deserved the chance because he fell in love with a girl a bit higher than him in social stature who felt sorry for him. However I am not even allowed to believe in her for the following reason. She had a slightly traumatizing experience in the beginning of the movie which is supposed to make us feel sorry for her but then she proves she doesn't deserve our pity when she aids the person who caused it in his escape, our beloved cop killer (explained later), Ben Affleck. So now her moral standing is at or below his and she legally earns and deserves a good amount of jail time herself.

At least Corleone's wife had to be lied to in order for her to stay with him. Okay, Ben Affleck doesn't actually shoot a cop but not because he's not trying too and also because the worst story with the lowest morals and lessons in the past 10 years also has the worst action scenes in the past 20. Ill explain. The people who really deserve justice in this movie, Boston's finest, are portrayed as, well, the only word to properly describe them is nincompoops. They are dumber and shoot worse than the bad guys form the 80's Die Hard movies. This is for the sake of prolonged action scenes which undeniably glorify our ""hero's"" will and ignorance of their wrong doing. As if every cop in the final shootout wouldn't have a picture of these guys in their pocket. ARE YOU FRIGGIN KIDDING ME? THEY GET AWAY IN COP UNIFORMS!? I haven't seen a plot twist that cheesy since that boy was kicked out of heaven by transformer angels in transformers 2! Not only are the real good guys dumb but they can't hit targets out in the open from 30-50 meters. Really, trained members of an American metropolitan SWAT team shoot like African war children with .762 AKs. No one has shot this bad in a movie since the bad guys from the black and white spaghetti westerns.

It is our American duty to boycott Ben Affleck's theatrical career from here on out for the sake of anyone who appreciates the common laws of man and thinks this world is a better place with police than without them.",1
23 October 2020,Rubbish - but in Boston!,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",4
3 January 2011,Boston is The Town,"I have to admit, Ben Affleck has done a tremendous job here. Writing, directing and playing a lead character is not easy to do if you are not Clint Eastwood or Robert Redford. For me, his stocks have arisen after seeing this movie. I already kinda expect what he is coming up next.

I liked the movie mainly for few things. First, it's a great entertainment. It has good chase scenes. The bank robbery scenes were also great. Some of the dialogues are quite intense. I mean, whatever you expect from a great action-movie, you'll find it here.

Boston is the town. In my opinion, one the most fascinating cities of US. It's not because I fancy Celtics or Red Sox to other sports clubs, it's more because the movies have shown it as a very mysterious and interesting city. It's something that you see and you'll immediately know that you wanna go there.

9 October 2017,Possibly a good film hiding in there,"I think there's probably a decent action film buried in this really long and ponderous film. As it is, you get some great sequences like an armored car robbery/car chase, but you have to sit through the endless set up of the Charlestown locale, an incredibly implausible relationship drama and a dozen speeches about how Affleck is going to change. Somehow the film never manages to find the time during it's two hour run time to explain how Affleck could plan and execute a robbery of Fenway Park while under constant FBI surveillance.

10 January 2011,Affleck returns to Boston with positive results.,"""So I came here, and I put him in the f*cking ground. Did nine years for it. Now, you don't gotta thank me...but you're not walking away.""

The Town is a heist thriller in the vein of Heat, in the sense that the movie is more about the personal lives of the criminals, and not the heists, themselves. There's plenty of action and conflict, but describing it as only an action movie would be overlooking a lot of The Town's depth. 

This is another solid directing job by Ben Affleck, even though I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Gone, Baby, Gone. It's set in the streets of the various Boston neighborhoods that he knows best, and there's an unmistakable authenticity to the settings and characters.

What could have been a fairly typical cat and mouse tale between cops and robbers is elevated by the excellent cast, that includes a fine performance from Affleck himself, as well as Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, and others. Interactions between the characters ring true, and their relationships feel complex and genuine as they push the story forward. 

I didn't find any particular aspect of The Town to be spectacular, but it's consistently solid and entertaining, as a whole. It's good to see Ben Affleck continuing the career resurgence that he's had in the last few years.",7
10 June 2016,One of my all time favourite movies,"Ben ""The Batman"" Affleck directs The Town an amazing movie with a really great plot and themes where Affleck is amazing both in front of and behind the camera as I think he gives an Oscar worthy performance here as Doug McRay a man who just doesn't know where he belongs in life and that struggle is what carries this movie as here it's not about the heist it's about the characters. Jeremy Renner received an Oscar nomination for this movie and it's very well deserved he's fantastic in this movie just excelling at being incredibly intense and even frightening at times. The film isn't all drama though this is first and foremost a bank robbery movie and those bank robberies are filmed very well as there really fast paced making them feel real. The chemistry between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall is perfect as its really believable you feel like these are real people in a real relationship. The Town is amazing extremely entertaining and in a lot of ways relatable it's one of the best bank robbery movies of all time with amazing performances proving that Ben Affleck is just as good a director as he is an actor.

10 June 2022,"Well-Directed, Finely-Acted, But Only Just Suspenseful Enough","The Town is well-directed, engaging, but the last hour lacks interesting sequences that drop you off, only to keep on being picked up again by action and suspense. Ben Affleck stars in the film as the leader of a pack of bank thieves who falls in love with an employee he held hostage, but he also directed and co-wrote the film very well.

It's definitely more of a crime-drama-themed movie over a heist movie, but at first, it starts off with a big, gun-loaded and a heavily-lifelike bank robbery, before all the action ends with the hostage being released and the title card. There's no doubt that this is a solid movie with substantial performances and excellent direction throughout, an engaging concept and real tension.

The first act revolves around the character keeping his life of crime a secret from his new date, but that ends up dropping off suddenly and that's also the mark where the film's every next 10 minutes are either really gripping and suspenseful, or just uninteresting. It's certainly appreciable that they don't completely continue with everything the first act was doing, because then it would be completely unoriginal and likely dull, but The Town isn't too much fun to watch.

18 December 2010,"Very Good, Suspenseful","Doug (Affleck) and his gang rob banks and armored cars in the town of Charlestown just outside Boston, MA. They are efficient and leave no clues for the police. All is good until Doug falls for Claire (Hall), one of the hostages on one of the jobs.

The only bit of truth in this film is that Charlestown has the reputation of having its banks robbed more than any other town in the country. Some say it's a family tradition handed down.

Ben Affleck directed this movie, and maybe he has found his true calling as he did an excellent job. Hey, we might have another Clint Eastwood on our hands. Who knew?

With any movie where the setting is in the Boston area, one can expect to hear the Boston accent, but here you hear it and not hear it as sometimes the characters forget to use it. Kind of funny. Why bother in the first place? The audience really doesn't care about accents. Well, unless they are over the top.

This was better than I expected. The pace was good and there was the suspense needed for this type of story. The acting was first rate by all, and the stunts were kind of amazing. No CGI, just actual police car chases which were right on. I couldn't help but notice how narrow the streets of Charlestown are. Charlestown was used as the filming location.

25 February 2011,Boring...,"This movie contains all what good action - thriller - bank job should have. Good actors, money (Ben Affleck), okay story and super nice Rebecca Hall. But I somehow got impression that I saw this all before in some other movie/s... If this one was made in 1990 probably would be interesting for some time but today after 20 millions movies like this made by a year... not even worth watching. Jeremy Renner got himself an Oscar nomination for this role but I am not sure that he deserved it. He is very good here but for academy nomination... Bottom line - Ben Affleck is trying as actor and as director, for me he failed this time but who knows??? Maybe next year we got some great FILM of his...

27 December 2010,The Town: 9/10,"Ben Affleck's previous work, Gone Baby Gone, is center around Boston. And in The Town, Ben Affleck revisits his hometown to do nothing more than talk trash on it. He must've really hated this town because both of his movies portrayed nothing but evil of Boston. Nevertheless, The Town is beautifully directed, written with great wit, and acted with much style.

The story centers around a bunch of bank robbers who have been successful at what they are doing. But the success comes to an end when Doug (Ben Affleck) decided to have a relationship with hostage Clairre (Rebecca Hall). As the relationship develops, Clairre finds out that Doug is a bank robber and it gets complicated. Meanwhile, Doug was having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's sister Krista (Blake Lively). Being jealous of Clairre, Krista decided to rat Doug and her brother's bank heist to the FBI resulting in a lot of stylized gun fires and great driving scenes. The end is obvious but it has a sad element that Ben Affleck wants the viewers to feel.

Writing, acting, and directing the whole film, Affleck's got a lot on his table but still manages to pull off every single role. As a writer, along with two others, Affleck was able to collaborate his knowledge of the Boston language and the wit of actual screen writing. As a director, he was able to direct a great gun fire sequence and a stylish car driving scene. As an actor, Affleck's performance would place second behind Jeremy Renner's. The Oscar winner continues to boost up his already impressive career with The Town.

Jeremy Renner isn't new to playing a cocky yet violent guy, but he especially stood out here with his badass attitude. Blake Lively's role was small but she gave it her all. You couldn't see her cuss in a Boston accent and have sex with Ben Affleck in Gossip Girl, could you? Well, there's the other reason to check it out.

While filled with much thrillers, the film also showed emotions. Helped by one of this year's best ensembled cast and stylish directing by Ben Affleck, The Town is an award-winning film.

OscarBuzz: Best Picture (good chance for a nod, not win), Best Screenplay (guarantee a nod, good chance for win), Best Supporting Actor (Jeremy Renner, good chance for a nod and win)",9
28 October 2010,A tense and gripping crime drama; definitely recommended,"I hadn't realized that Ben Affleck was directing now, I guess I haven't been paying as close attention as I thought I was. Apparently Mr. Affleck had also taken part in the directing of Gone Baby Gone (2007), another highly acclaimed film that I'm very intent on seeing, but for now I'll be talking about the Daredevil's newest film that I saw just last weekend, the current top rated film in America, The Town.

This is probably the best movie about bank robberies ever, and if you are a person who does work at a bank (like my mom does) then this movie will send you into paranoid overdrive.

The movie sets us in the scum infested city Charlestown in Boston, our attention focused towards a single, troubled group of people, who like so many in this god forsaken urban have been secreted to a life of crime. These people are aware of what they are and they accept it, and when you are brought up into this kind of world, the only really comfort you receive is the knowing that you are never alone. There is a sense of family between this torn group of people, an undenying sense of loyalty and responsibility, and when Doug McGray is forced to make the difficult decision to choose between the love of his life and the very people who he grew up with, there is a tensely engaging impute of emotional compelligness and fierce suspense into the wondering of who is going to be the first to pull the trigger on the people they love.

That is a very good script, wouldn't you agree? Involving, well thought through, and not the least bit predictable, and the weaving together of drama and romance is very engaging element.

And how about that cast? It's not often you get such a great team of actors to perform in the one movie. Jeremy Renner was wonderful, and Ben Afflek was excellent as the intense Doug McGray, probably one of his best portrayals ever.

The Town will be one of the most thrilling movies you will ever see in 2010. It's brilliant direction, engaging script, and monumental cast give plenty of recommendation for an Oscar nomination.",8
14 October 2010,confidently directed and very well acted,"The Town seems to have a plot as generic as the title but it's a delight for sure, a studio picture offering interesting characters situations and characters. Ben Affleck, both as lead actor and as director, gets to create much adrenaline in a first-rate ensemble. In this story he projects a blend of violence, sadness and discontent that depicts wonderfully the Irish mob of Boston. At the same time the other characters are much more involved than they appear at first. Ben Affleck hasn't certainly overloaded The Town with action, but hasn't avoided it totally. Overall Boston's narrow streets and some Irish faces streets give perfectly the idea of a declining criminal environment.

31 May 2015,Kiss of Death,"I can't remember the guy's name, a radio commentator who is generally conservative, but more ferocious in his humor and delivery than a Limbaugh or a Hannity. Geez, I wish I could pull up his name. He was talking on air about how it's irrational to discount a performer's work if one finds his personal life and opinions offensive.

Ben Affleck is a flaming liberal. If he makes great movies, why would you say you hated his movies because you hate his public leftist dribbling. That was the commentator's point, and he was, in fact, talking about Affleck.

I think Ben Affleck is over-rated as an actor, but has a pretty good handle on directing a movie. That's cool. If he ever crashes and burns as an actor, he's got a backup plan.

Now, to bring this around to his The Town, an entertaining but predictable crime drama, set in Charlestown in Boston, and populated with characters you've seen before in other flicks--Kiss of Death (1947) and it's 1995 remake come to mind. Affleck has crafted a serviceable robbery crew/FBI/love story story. Nothing stood out except or two items of interest:

Jeremy Renner was one item. He breathes some life into an ordinary character (the violent friend of the protagonist).

The car chase at the start of The Town is so claustrophobic, with cops and crew careening down the narrowest streets this side of, say, Italy. I was actually dodging and weaving as the cars slammed and screeched down one street and onto another road.

There are lots of actors and actresses here who are so good, so comfortable in their respective roles. Affleck is the weary robber; Renner, his friend who believes that Affleck will always owe him for taking a fall for him; Rebecca Hall as the frail love interest who Affleck wants and Renner wants dead; Jon Hamm is the predictably vicious fed who went to the Richard Jordan School of How to Play a Repulsive Fed.

Did you get the reference to a better Boston crime drama?

The Friends of Eddie Coyle.

Which The Town isn't. It does hold it's own, delivering a satisfaction that lots of crime dramas can't or won't. I wasn't so much impressed with the movie as I was pleased that the 125 minutes I invested in Affleck's movie were not wasted.

Which brings me back to Affleck on screen, behind the camera, and making political poopoo in his occasional interview. So what if he's a dope in real life? His work works.

If I had my way, Jane Fonda would be rotting in Supermax for treason, but her performance in 1971's Klute was brilliant.

What's a movie-lover to do?

Oh, I got the name, I think! Adam Corolla (sp?).",6
23 May 2021,"Great Action scenes, lame Romance story","This is easily one of the greatest crime movies ever, the execution of the robberies are perfect, clean, clever and pure genius. The side story on the other hand, is generic and dull romance, bad written and very unrealistic, totally lame.

Ben Affleck's character tries to hard to be the ""Heart of gold"" Thief, is an extremely enjoyable movie besides the flaws.

29 March 2023,A nice drama,"I got to know about this movie after watching a clip of the movie where a group of robbers do a crime wearing nun masks. I decided to watch the movie and it was a nice experience. The movie was a slow crime drama which is nicely directed by Ben Affleck. Every cast members did nice work and the story nicely shows the event in true light. There were no hi-fi things as there are in other crime action movies nowadays. The movie feels depressed by the end showing that the makers successfully did what they wanted to show.

Overall, it was a nice crime drama movie and you should definitely give it a try.

Ben Affleck (Doug) and his gang loots the bank and kidnaps the manager, Claire Keesey, as a hostage and releases her later. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. Doug tries to leave the job and start something new but it would not be easy for him as he other commitments. When I saw the trailer of this film , i thought it would be just an average flick but my curiosity rose up after hearing lot of critical acclaim and reviews of the film and my joy knew no bounds after watching the movie. Though it started on a slow note but later it turned out to be very engrossing and ready - to- chill thriller. The performances were really awesome especially by Ben Affleck , Jeremy Renner and Rebbecca Hall . The direction was very sharp and witty. Ben Affleck has shown lot of improvement with each films. The cinematography was equally convincing. The bottom line :- Go for it .... Awesome !!",8
22 October 2010,"Benny proves Gone, Baby Gone wasn't a fluke.","Ben Affleck seems like a big goofy guy in the Keanu Reeves mould - a goodlooking doofus with a bit of charm who remembers a few lines and stands on an X with a camera pointed at him.

Half of Hollywood's elite could be described similarly.

Then I saw Gone, Baby Gone and was forced to admit that I might have been way off. Was it a fluke, a one off, a lucky lightning strike.

""Let's see what he does next"" I sez...

Now before I continue The Town isn't near Gone Baby Gone, the story is more straightforward and a little derivative at times. But Mr Affleck (to you) has proved he is no one trick pony. If anything he has proved to me that his future seems rosier behind the lens than in front of it.

There is a rough area in Boston (pronounced Borrrstun apparently) called Charlestown and as the movie semi-brags it is home to more bank robbers per head of population than any other area. Kids are literally raised into crime as the family business.

The Town looks on one such crew, though to be fair it really focuses on two guys.

Doug (Affleck) is a master planner. He considers the risk vs the reward, the timing and plans for every possibility before the heist commences...

Measure twice - cut once.

His father is in prison for life (you'll never guess why), and his Mother apparently ran out on the family when he was a boy.

Doug knows that violent criminals are more mercilessly hunted by the police so each job has more intimidation and threat than brutality. He also quickly deals with any tracers or dye packs that could prevent or impede a quick getaway.

In / out with minimal fuss. Crime is merely Doug's job.

Jim AKA Gem (Jeremy Renner) on the other hand loves the life, perhaps a little too much. He is a loose cannon. A hothead.

When asked to take a ride to beat up a guy whom he has never met, for reasons he can never know Gem has but one question: ""Whose car should we take?"" Gem is a dangerous man, even among criminals.

The first scenes show the latest job for Doug, Gem and the other two members of the group - everyone bar the afore-named are merely peripheral characters - the bank job goes well, almost without a hitch until...

In light of this unexpected development Gem decides to take a female bank worker hostage until the coast is clear, and they release shortly after the getaway - taking her ID as a parting threat to remind her that if she helps the police they know where she lives... The problem is that the staff member got a fair gander at some potentially identifying characteristics on one of the gang.

Job complete the boys lie low for a while until the to-do dies down a little, reporting only of their success to sinister and menacing Boss of ops Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite, looking seedier than ever).

But Doug being very much a guy that dots the i's and crosses the t's decides to follow up on this bankie to see if she might prove a problem, knowing full well that the investigators on the case will grill her for everything she knows (John Hamm plays Agent Frawley). A twist of fate leaves Claire and Doug face to face in a laundromat, rather than avoid any interaction Doug strikes up a conversation and the two chat, setting up a date.

The next day while Doug struggles with the conundrum of whether it is really a good idea to be taking the person most likely to send him to prison out; Gem openly wonders if they should ""take her Out""... big difference.

So Doug decides it might not be the best idea to inform Gem of recent dating developments in his love life.

The remainder of the film deals with the burgeoning relationship between Doug and Claire and the impact that it might have on both their lives. Doug decides that maybe performing major crimes might not be in his and Claire's best interests - but evidently it is not an easy life to get out of. Gem and Fergie are around to make damn sure of that.

The Town had a couple of solid action sequences during the multiple heists which almost covered up some of the logic and plot holes. Hamm's Agent Frawley always seemed only a step behind the crew at all times but I'm not so sure the real FBI would be ecstatic with the investigation in this film - there seemed to be more than a couple of opportunities to nab someone that were either ignored or overlooked.

The gimmick of the criminal hooking up with an innocent is not new, most recently coming up in another (inferior) film called The Ministers. It is mostly handled well but again there with even the most casual queries Doug's alibi would have evaporated swiftly.

The Town has a little more flash than Affleck's previous effort but still toes the right side of credibility and reality - if he had closed over some of those plot holes Affleck might have had another minor classic on his hands, as it stands he will have to settle for a very good and entertaining second effort.

Oh and as far as everyone lauding Jeremy Renner as Gem - he is OK but not mind blowing or even especially menacing. It seems that if a non-Bostonian has a crack at the accent and semi pulls it off that they are immediately awesome. See Nicholson; Jack.

Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. An entertaining couple of hours. One of many good films to be released lately.

31 July 2011,Not a Ben Affleck FanOKmaybe I am,"Like many movies, past experiences tell me that certain cast members are not worth their spit and usually will just plain scare me off. Also, if I see a certain director's name stamped on a movie, I will shun any and all performances under their guidance. I think I am usually correct (although I honestly know I am usually wrong but won't admit it), but in Mr. Affleck's case I will have to see if his movie history is really worthy of any further viewing by me. I will go through his bad flicks. Now let's see, first there was 'Armageddon'. Oh wait he did an excellent job in a very good movie – so stupid on my part – I must be eating idiot flakes for breakfast again. OK – let's look for more garbage Mr. Affleck did. Hmmmm, oh yeah, 'Dazed and Confused.' WAIT – I was in high school in '74, and that is the consummate movie of that genre. That is the way it was and Mr. Affleck played the high school jerk to -a-'T'. I guess it is time to eat crow. I saw the movie, 'The Town', and boy was I gob-smacked. Not only can Ben act, he can certainly do a wonderful job directing. This was a very good movie about an underbelly of Boston that few ever see. ""Riveting"", ""nail biting"" and ""pant-wetting-edge-of-the-seat-spine-tingling-sensation"" (too much?). In any case, nice job Ben and I now declare myself a fan.

16 January 2016,Surprisingly good movie by Affleck,"Just as I'm flipping through channels, I thought I heard a familiar voice. It sounded like Ben Affleck. I paused. It was Ben Affleck in calm conversation with a lovely brunette. They weren't talking about anything deep or intellectual. I thought maybe this would be something of Mr. Affleck's that I hadn't heard about. Well, it turned out to be a movie with guns and criminals and the FBI. I sighed, but I just never got around to turning the channel. Slowly but surely, even though I had come in on the middle of the movie, I was hooked. Before the end, I had to see what the name of this movie was so that I could come look it up online and tell somebody that they did a good job. So, here I am. Ben Affleck, people will probably try to pigeonhole you in different ways. Personally, you remind me of Robert Redford. But, none of that means anything. Ya did a good job with this movie. I think you're probably a good guy. Keep it up!

5 August 2011,Taking money that isn't yours...wrong but thrilling,"Let's be honest here. People slave away all day trying to make a buck. The majority of people will continue to do this and it works. I even recommend it. Now that being said, there are those that like money too, but don't want to work for it in the traditional sense. Instead, they like to work for it their way. Welcome to The Town. It's about a crew who can and does take down heists and they don't even entertain getting caught. Ben Affleck gets to direct and act and show off his well earned talent and skills in making this movie work. This movie is like a comfortable glove for him. I can easily get absorbed into the adventure and thrill of the mission, but people get hurt and killed and that just doesn't make whatever is happening right in the real world. But in the movie world, well it works. Also, the cursing in this movie is distasteful because it is over done at times. I realize it is necessary to convey a certain type mentality and give the movie scene a certain feel. For me, it detracted a little. Curse to make a point, not a dialog. The ending is satisfying and can cause the viewer some thinking after the movie ends. Now isn't that what entertainment is all about? This movie easily joins the ranks of the stick em ups....Enjoy",8
18 January 2012,Ben's 2 for 2,"Ben Affleck follows up his excellent directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone, with another winner in The Town. It's perhaps not quite up to the standards of his first film but it is very good in its own right. Affleck goes back to the world he knows best, Boston. In this case specifically the neighborhood of Charlestown, perhaps the nation's most notable armed robbery hot spot. Robbing banks, holding up armored trucks, it's a way of life for the residents of Charlestown. Well not all of them of course. But enough of them to make the area's reputation well-earned. From this neighborhood comes the group of four thieves our story will follow, the crime lord who holds the crew under his thumb and the strung-out girl clinging to the dream of a romance that has long since passed her by. It turns out there's one other important character who calls Charlestown home. Claire is the manager of the bank our crew robs in the film's opening. She ends up being taken hostage but is released unharmed. When the thieves find out she's from the neighborhood what are they to do about her? The hothead of the group would have no qualms about putting a bullet in her head. The more reasoned leader of the group decides to track her, find out what she knows, see if she can implicate them. He ends up doing more than tracking her, he falls in love with her. This, needless to say, provides complications.

Affleck himself plays the lead role of Doug, the bank robber looking for a way out who may have found it in this new romance which blooms with Claire. But getting out is never easy. Not when hot-tempered Jem finds out Doug's fooling around with the girl who could put them all away for life. And not when crime lord Fergie always has another job for the crew. And not when Doug's old flame Krista, who happens to be Jem's sister, refuses to let go. It's a very tangled web, one which seems to have Doug well and truly trapped. Charlestown keeps a strong hold on those who call it home.

Affleck does a reasonably fine job with his portrayal of this somewhat tortured character. There is the nagging sense that his time in front of the camera here may have detracted a bit from his work as the director. This movie is not nearly as focused as Gone Baby Gone, a little sloppy at times. Character development is rushed or in some cases nonexistent. Jem, played with a wonderful spark and clear menace by Jeremy Renner, is the only character other than Doug who we really feel we get to know much at all. Crime lord Fergie, played by a scarily gaunt Pete Postlethwaite, obviously holds a powerful sway over Doug and his crew but we never know why. It's left rather unexplained how such a sickly old man could hold young, powerful toughs so firmly under his thumb. Old girlfriend Krista, played by a seemingly miscast Blake Lively, is woefully underdeveloped. All we know about her is that she's a train wreck and that she longs for Doug. And Lively is a little too glamorous to do train wreck very well. Jon Hamm plays the lead FBI agent who is no different from any other FBI agent you've seen in a movie like this. And even Claire, the new love of Doug's life and the woman who is really the key to the whole story, is pretty much a blank slate. Doug obviously forms an emotional connection with her. We in the audience never do.

So there are some things you wish The Town did better. But there are many things which it does very, very well. It opens with a Dark Knight-esque bang with a thrilling opening heist scene. The other robberies later on in the film are well done too, Affleck proving he can be an action director. While we may struggle to identify with some of the other characters Doug's plight is very easy to relate to and with his portrayal Affleck creates a very sympathetic character out of a guy who is involved in some rather nasty business. Well done that is. There is the sense that the movie drags some between the big action sequences. The romance between Doug and Claire, and the conflict it causes between Doug and Jem, isn't always enough to sustain the film's energy as it moves forward. Affleck and Renner work together very well, and there's really nothing wrong with Rebecca Hall's performance as Claire either, but the story never fully engages the way you'd hope it would. And with so much of the focus on these three characters everyone else gets the short shrift. And that comes back to bite Affleck in the end when train wreck Krista is put in position to make a decision that sets the whole final act in motion. We haven't spent enough time with Krista for it to ring true that the whole movie suddenly gets tossed in her lap. It all can be a little frustrating at times. You know this movie could've been better. Maybe by starring as well as directing Affleck stretched himself a little thin. But even accounting for the flaws it does have The Town is still an entertaining, well-made film. Could've been better but still manages to be pretty good when all is said and done.",7
27 August 2023,"Starts off well, then descends into stupidity","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",4
16 December 2012,Great Action and Acting!,"Ben Allflect directs and stars in ""The Town,"" a gritty drama about Charlestown, MA and its tradition of bank robbers. Afflect plays Doug McCray, the brains of the gang, and Jeremy Renner is Jem, his main sidekick and real hard case. There are four members of the gang and they professionally carry out bank robberies around Boston systematically burning all evidence. They always have air tight alibis.

The gist of the story is Doug's growing love for Claire Keasy, the bank manager of a bank they have held up. She is taken hostage and is traumatized by the experience. Doug attempts to deflect any inclination she may have to provide evidence to the FBI by getting to know her but doesn't count on his developing real feelings for her.

This situation and how it is resolved make up the guts of the movie. It is fast paced and realistic with some scenes of real violence.

""The Town"" is not for young children, but adults and older adolescents will enjoy this finely made film.",9
26 March 2013,FLAWLESS movie with a soul!,"This movie was the perfect criminal movie and with a soul! The entire cast gave amazing performances and I really liked the emotion in this classic.

Ben Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a professional Boston bank robber, where the movie takes place by the way, Jeremy Renner plays James Coughlin, Doug's ruthless criminal buddy, Rebecca Hall plays Claire Keesey, a bank manager who foolishly falls in love with Doug, and Blake Lively as Krista Coughlin, a young and beautiful slut with a 19 month old daughter. This movie was one of the best I've ever seen, with a wonderful performance by Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall, AND Blake Lively! The soul part is the fact that Doug falls in love with a bank manager and will do anything to keep her safe. Their love is very strong until Claire finds out the truth about Doug. Blake Lively gave a surprisingly touching performance as the young beautiful woman trying to do right for her 1 and a half year old girl. This movie is the PERFECT film for most!

I loved this movie and I'm sure you will too if you watch it. Directed by Ben Affleck, it's a must-see movie with action and emotion!",10

13 July 2020,"Stylish and captivating, despite the predictable plot","I must say I found it hard to get past the fact that Ben Affleck looks and sounds almost exactly like Adam Sandler in this movie. I'm not quite sure how this happened but it certainly unnerved me, especially as a clinically diagnosed PTSD sufferer (Post-Traumatic Sandler Disorder).

Unintentional deep-fakes aside, I really quite enjoyed this movie. The story is heavily cliched, largely predictable and somewhat self-indulgent, but despite this it managed to keep me engrossed throughout with well-choregraphed action scenes and gritty styling. Affleck has a tendency to glamorise his own characters and this is no exception, but he is still very watchable in the lead role. The supporting cast is very strong and probably the reason this feels like more than a cheap paint-by-numbers action movie. A very solid production and a big tick on Affleck's resume.

2 December 2010,waste of time,"I don't know how this movie got such stellar reviews, but this ain't The Heat. The overall feeling after experiencing it is that of a disjointed puzzle. Despite the great cast, they fail to support the incoherent roles and plot in any satisfying way. In fact, the main protagonist is bouncing between two different types of personalities for the entire movie. No, the internal struggle or the baggage of traumas are not covering this erratic behavior. And the tension between characters is so fake, you can cut it with a knife. The only redeeming qualities are a couple of good action scenes and the decent love story. Rebecca Hall is pretty hot. In conclusion, the movie is worth one viewing, but I cannot recommend it to anyone. There are better thrillers.

This is my first review, just for the record.

18 October 2010,The Town,"The Town is based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and we soon learn that this is one of the biggest bank robbery capitals in America. As the film goes along we are introduced to a team of bank robbers, who after several elaborate heists have always managed to walk away with a lot of money and still have not been arrested, or caught for it. We also meet an FBI team who is closing in on the robbers because of enough background information and evidence they have to finally get their culprits, if only they can catch them in the act. There is also a romance that blossoms in the film, but due to the circumstances of the characters, it is going to take deceit and eventually loyalty to make it work, if it does end up working at all. If you see the film, you will know what I am talking about. The film is all about loyalty to friends, loved ones and even the authorities and all these different characters will be put into a situation of which to choose to best suit their lives and the ones around them. When I first saw trailers for The Town several months ago at the theatre, I already thought then that this looked like it was going to be a really good movie. The trailers and my expectations were correct. What I was surprised by though, was that The Town wasn't the movie I thought it was going to be. The trailers made the film look a certain way and while I was watching it, I discovered that in a lot of ways it was a different film than advertised. This is not a complaint because I loved the final product. The Town works because of it's tight script which has some very good character study and development and it puts the different characters in tough situations and moral dilemmas and watching them decide what to do that will be best for themselves, but also for the ones around them, I found fascinating to watch and fairly realistic and not clichéd, or predictable at all, which I really compliment the film on. The film also has a terrific pace to it. It does have very little action scenes in it and they are not really needed to make this film more exciting. I say this because the lives of these characters become so involving to us that we really want to see what happens between them and what decisions they make and we do get in a sense to even care for them. It is so involving and fascinating that the over two hour running time is rarely felt because everything is so captivating. The acting is all very good here as well. I would not single out a single performance as being the best because I think the whole cast really does good work here. The direction is tight and focused and really brings the film together and makes for a really entertaining and thrilling watch. Last week I reviewed the Australian film Animal Kingdom which is also about criminal activities. In some ways they are the same and in some they are different. I personally liked The Town better because I really felt we got to know these characters better and the on screen chemistry was great. This film also successfully blends different genres including drama, action and even romance and all were pulled off terrifically and it felt more human to me. The Town is one of the best films of 2010 and I am glad it is doing so well with critics, audiences and the box office.",10
7 January 2022,Wicked dull.,"I gotta great idea: assemble the best character actors working today and give them a script that's made up of scenes that better movies left on the cutting room floor. Honestly, everyone deserves better than they get here, and if it wasn't for the solid performances, ""The Town"" would be unwatchable.

""The Town"" offers minor distractions from the crime caper genre, but not enough to distinguish it in any way. Each role is thinly written and overacted to the edge of laughability and/or yawns, and the slightest hint of estrogen gets beaten back with more gunfire and shouting (Rebecca Hall is a ""bank manager"" charmed by blank-faced man-chunk in a laundromat? Blake Lively a porcelain-skinned drug-addict who just wants to be loved...by a blank-faced man-chunk 12-stepper?). Car chases, shoot-outs, and ludicrous escape plans all amount to 2 hours of noise in pretty, blue-hued, Oscar-slumming nonsense.

""The Town"" pretends to be much smarter than it is and that makes Affleck's attempts at arty moralizing all the more exhausting. You could stick around to the end to see if psychopaths manage to eek out one last score, or you could just wash the dishes and imagine a better movie.",5

18 March 2012,A very enjoyable multi-layered crime drama...,"Made in a very realistic style which, as with his directorial debut, 'Gone Baby Gone' (2007), matches the mood of the piece really well. All the performances were excellent, but I particularly liked Rebecca Hall as Claire Keesey, Jeremy Renner as James Coughlin and Blake Lively as his sister, Krista Coughlin; all three put in sterling performances. Of course, Ben Affleck proved once again what a fine actor he is as Doug MacRay. Also worthy of note were; Jon Hamm as FBI S.A. Adam Frawley, Slaine as Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan, Owen Burke as Desmond Elden, Titus Welliver as Dino Ciampa and finally a mention for Pete Postlethwaite as 'The Florist', Fergus 'Fergie' Colm in one of his last roles.

A complicated plot that's quite heavy on dialogue in places, but there are some very nicely put together action scenes in there too. There are several threads to the story that all tie up in the end, although the poignant ending does leave the audience guessing to some extent. I must say I did enjoy this film with its multi-layered plot and, at times, edgy style. It's certainly one I would give another viewing to at some point in the future Recommended.

My score: 8.3/10.

6 February 2011,"""The Town"" with Ben Affleck","I just watched ""The Town"" with Ben Affleck. Every time I started to think it was going to slow down, it changed. I loved it. All of the actors were great, the story line was believable, and the cinematography was excellent. This is the type of crime drama / action movie that anyone could enjoy. I would have to temper that with, ""If you are skittish at blood, not the movie for you"" and I wouldn't suggest it for children. The author even worked a love story in the middle of the movie and also lets us see one of the bad guys from a different perspective and shows the human side of a career criminal. I enjoyed it so much that I would consider buying this movie and watching it over and over.

23 October 2010,Hard hitting heist caper,"Critics have slammed Ben Affleck in recent times, but their criticism is sorely misplaced when it comes to Affleck's latest blockbuster - The Town. Fresh off the success of his last venture, he has starred in and directed a masterpiece.

The Town is the story of Charlestown. A low-income neighborhood in Boston. The people coming out of this blue-collar town have rap-sheets stretching way back. But these gangsters and bank robbers are as savvy as they are violent.

Affleck's crew have one last heist to pull off before they throw the towel in. With the FBI hot on their tail and a budding romance in the works, this hard-hitting, gritty caper pulls no punches in delivering a KO performance.

From an entertainment perspective, it's absolutely riveting viewing. Two-thumbs up for Affleck and his star power.",9

This latest film THE TOWN has him acting in the lead role as well - and he's pretty good. Jeremy Renner (THE HURT LOCKER) is better but he's got the richer role. In fact - give Renner an Oscar now. The guy is good. His style reminds me of Russell Crowe. And his easy way with props - IE high-powered weaponry - is ballistic and balletic. An assault rifle is a true extension of his arm.

Is THE TOWN another love letter to Ben's home town of Boston? Yeah. The stats on inherited criminality in Charlestown set the scene. People have been going into the family business for centuries. The family business of Charlestown is bank robbery.

The cast is solid. Pete Postlethwaite is a florist - but not just a florist. Mad Men's Jon Hamm leads the FBI team (they should have changed his hair from his Mad Men side-parted cut. For a minute there I thought they called Don Draper from Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce to come and solve a major crime spree.) Blake Lively got the girl role but it didn't sink into a straight stereotype though she came a bit close for comfort from time to time. And Chris Cooper. Great actor. Does he ever put in a less than authentic performance? I haven't seen it happen.

I'm a big fan of the costume criminal. Great to see a bit of a homage to LOTR Ringwraiths - or perhaps the Grim Reaper. And the 'nuns with guns' theme went down a treat.

There are some genuinely comedic moments that didn't feel contrived or forced. And while I enjoyed every moment of the suspense, I knew some other people might have a moral objection to what the film tries to remind us of - that crims have careers they care about; that sometimes they get burned out and need a sea-change; that they have families, romantic dilemmas and of course - feelings.

For fans of 2nd unit action - you can look forward to a high body count - car bodies. I haven't seen this much mechanical carnage since maybe THE BLUES BROTHERS.

So overall - a great film that had the audience totally engrossed and dead silent.

Well, almost.

A couple of annoying numb-nuts behind me decided the soundtrack during act 3 would benefit from their fat fists digging around a garbage bag of crisps then loudly masticating and digesting the shoddy fake food. Why can't people just go watch a movie and put down the feedbag for 2 hours? I mean, not even newborns need that much constant food.

Can't wait for cinemas to sell giant bags of shut the hell up.

Anyway - go see THE TOWN. It's a good ride.",8
10 August 2011,Deserved high ratings and praise,"This past month, this movie was on the movie channels, over and over. I trust that people who had not seen it got a chance to do so by now and if that wasn't enough, word of mouth should also have sealed the deal of the financial success of the movie. I loved it. I'd be suspicious of those who did not; avoid these people because who knows what they're capable of. Yeah yeah everybody's entitled to their opinion and I certainly don't hold back writing mine, but it's like the Goth people, if you know what I mean.

Affleck did a superb job directing and was also quite good in his role as Doug MacRay. Jeremy Renner has proved again what powerful characters he's capable of playing. Renner is as believable an Irishman as he can be a redneck. In Renner's lesser known flicks he's also played some scary dudes (guidelines preclude me from using the word M**F**) such as Fred in ""A little trip to heaven"" and Jeffrey Dahmer in ""Dahmer"". As Brian Gamble in ""S.W.A.T."", he was not as scary as he was intense. I was most pleased to see the see the luscious Rebecca Hall; I'm sorry if using the term offends some but I can't help it if I think she's hot as well as an accomplished actor.

Affleck has managed to do what very few actors have over time, utter words, a line or an expression, that becomes famous in of itself, and that line was: "" I need your help. I can't tell you what it is; you can never ask me about it later and we're going to hurt some people."" It's as classic as Eastwood's ""Do you feel lucky punk?"" or ""Go ahead; make my day!""",8
29 May 2020,An average heist movie 6/10,"Ben Affleck is a well appreciated director and actor but when it comes to movies about a heist or big robbery, then it's a little difficult to make an impression. The film happens to be an average heist movie with no twists and not a lot of entertainment. Although I did love the performance of the actors: Jon Hamm was good and great. The ending was greatly done and well made. I do love Ben Affleck's movies but maybe I was expecting too much. I do love his other movies though. overall a nice movie that reminds other heist movies so no surprise here.

27 September 2010,Gripping tension,"A good-guy bank robber? It actually works if you have some empathy for the characters and the environment they come from. Ben Affleck is completely credible, with a back story to support why his character does what he does. As an actor, his basic likability makes it possible to understand the internal struggle, and his difficulty in being the caring boyfriend and a brutal thug.

The film has been faintly praised by some for its Boston backgrounds, but that is unfair. With those streets, populated by the likes of Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper, this is an environment that drags you in by your collar.

The action of the heists and the inevitable car chases are as good as Ronin, and that says a lot.

27 July 2011,easily Ben Aflecks best!,"This movie is easily one of the best of the year. It has a great story line great performances by all actors. Even Afleck in the best role of his life.

This movie is about a long time thief who has a relationship with a bank teller. Within the movie he preforms many robberies but as the movie progresses he has to decide if this is really what he wants from life or if he wants more.

This movie is very intense. It has great scenes that leave you at the edge of your seat. If you love a good action drama then this one is for you. I would recommend this movie to everyone go watch it if you haven't

28 December 2010,The Town movie review,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",9

20 October 2010,Machine-gunned by F-words,"Whilst I agree with most of what other reviewers have said about the energy and originality of Ben Affleck's movie, I have a real problem with the amazing volume of F-words in the script. OK, I know people use them all the time, but two or three in the same sentence - and over and over - it's like being machine-gunned by the writer (also Affleck, in this case).

Back in the bad old good old days, actors managed to convey menace and even pure evil without the use of profanity - an outstanding example would be Robert Mitchum in the original CAPE FEAR. Nowadays, if a writer wants to show a bad guy, he just chucks in a bunch of F-words. It's lazy writing - and lazy acting. Movies and TV plays where the F-word is used sparingly have a lot more impact.

Call me old-fashioned - and you will! - I just wish there was a bit more SUBTLETY in Crime movies and Dramas.",7
1 February 2012,If there's anything that Ben Affleck knows...,"It would be writing/directing/producing movies that have to do with Boston and people who people in the Southie accent. Between The Town, Gone Baby Gone and Good Will Hunting you'd have to say it's safe to say he can relate to the type of characters in these movies. As the #2 lead Jeremy Renner is absolutely on his game as Jem his #2 guy in their crew. Blake Lively is very good in a far different type of character then you're used to seeing her in. Rebecca Hal, Jon Hamm, Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwiate also very good in their respective roles.

Everything seems real about this movie whether it's the grittiness of the area they live in, the action choreography being spot on and just the overall characterization of the characters.

25 October 2010,The Town is a successful crime thriller,"The Town is a crime thriller about a team of bank robbers in Boston area. The story centers around 3 main characters, Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) and James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner). Doug and James are professional bank robbers but they are opposite characters. Doug, even though a criminal, is portrayed as a likable, charming character. We see more of his positive qualities: he refrains from harming other people. Doug, on the other hand, is a truly corrupt character who enjoys hurting other people.

A lot of people point out the similarities between The Town and Heat and claim The Town is an imitation of Heat. Although there are some similarities I think this is inevitable since both movies are about a team of bank robbers and there will be bank robbery, shoot-out and car chase scenes and a romantic love affair always adds a flavor to stories. I actually liked The Town better than Heat. I thought Heat was too long; the story was drawn-out needlessly which ruined its pace and took away from the action. The Town, on the other hand, focuses more on the action. I also think action scenes in The Town are better and more suspenseful.

If you like crime thrillers, you should definitely check this one out. You will find The Town is a decent, well-directed, entertaining movie.",8

4 July 2020,Boston isn't always quiet and peaceful,"What worked:
screenplay;The movie is engaging, honest and violent at times. despite that, the movie wins overall with depth in lead character's role. The movie had the ending that was real and expected despite the tragedy. The project as a whole worked despite some flaws in narrative
What did not work:
some lopeholes; the movie is not without plot holes.Of course the movie could have worked more in the investigation part of the movie, the antagonist. There were moments in movie when we can say if only the police were shown as smarter.
Final verdict: recommended at least once

23 January 2011,Intriguing tale of crime and conflicting loyalties,"Better than your average caper movie, ""The Town"" focuses on a group of four career criminals (led by Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner, who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) from Charlestown in Boston. They're smart and good at what they do—until Ben Affleck's character falls for the bank manager they rob. Wanting to leave his criminal past behind him, he appeals to his cohorts, who refuse to let him get away before pulling off one last job. Commitment to friends becomes compromised with his developing love for the bank manager, and the authorities, in the form of Jon Hamm as an FBI agent and the always under-appreciated Titus Welliver as a Boston PD detective, begin closing in. The story is smart and well-developed, and the action sequences are explosive and exciting. Not quite sure this movie is Oscar material, as some have argued, but it certainly affirms that Affleck has matured considerably as an actor and a director.

2 January 2011,"A Boston crime family excels at bank robbery, but nobody is perfect. How will they continue while keeping ahead of the cops?","Powerful and distinct characters richly portray a life of crime in Boston in this gripping tale of expert bank robbers trying to stay one-step ahead of an ever escalating police manhunt.

It's a challenging tale of Good vs. Bad vs. Worse when our mastermind bank criminal (Ben Affleck) decides he's had enough of his seedy, immoral life and wants to change for the better. But can he escape from not only the cops who are banging at the door, but the cohorts who depend on him and refuse their blessings for his departure? ""The Town"" is a well-done movie which is sometimes hard to understand the thick accents and mumbled words. However the storyline is easy to follow, mostly linear, well-acted with some tense moments as we fear discovery and capture for our criminals. Interesting that we root for Ben Affleck's character, because in spite of all his robberies and crime he has a soft heart and desires change. It's revealed that he fell into this lifestyle, and so we feel forgiveness is allowed.

Compared to something like Oceans 11, the heists pulled off seem relatively simple - especially the grandest theft of the movie, which was just too easy. I also felt a little more could have been done with plot elements like the give-away tattoo and the potential for the intelligent girlfriend to discover the true identity of her boyfriend.

But what little there is to criticize is easily compensated for with excellent action and an intriguing plot. We seem to be eternally interested in geniuses (even if their smarts are in the field of robbery.) Car chases, ambushes, gun fights, disguises, crime families... what's not to like!",8

28 October 2012,Pleasant,"After a poor ""Gone Baby Gone"", Ben Affleck shows great improvement and manages this time to captivate the viewer with this dynamic and rather well written film, though the love story could have used more romanticism. Also, the extended cut of the movie (+ 25 min approx.) is lengthy even if it clearly contains useful parts.

The cast provokes mixed feelings, with an excellent Jeremy Renner and a touch lower Ben Affleck, a bit too apathetic at moments like his brother Casey. Still, the characters are well developed.

As for the direction, it is mastered yet the use of aerial shots (helicopter shots) turns out to be redundant and useless.

13 January 2011,Now THAT's how you make a cops n robbers flick folks!,"I was one of the very few people disappointed by ""The Departed."" Being in the Boston area, folks here can spot fake accents a mile away, and on top of that annoying gaffe, much of the movie seemed too stylized and hyperbolized for its own good. It was Cops n Robbers as HIGH DRAMA, a film that tried to achieve the operatic tone and scale of The Godfather but just wound up feeling cheap in the end.

It needed the gritty, unadorned performances and look that director/actor Ben Affleck has somehow managed to score in spades with ""The Town."" Much of the film's punch rides on the performances: Affleck has never been less self-absorbed and never more absorbed in his character, a master bank robber whose increasing self-disgust finally finds a well-needed escape valve in the form of pretty bank manager Rebecca Hall. Now if only he hadn't taken her hostage in his last job....

Perhaps even more powerful are the drop-dead notes struck by Jeremy Renner, as Affleck's hard-case brother, Pete Postelthwaite as a dirt-bag local numbers runner, and Chris Cooper in a died-in-the-wool performance that is chilling for its brief on screen time. Even Jon Hamm knocks it out of the park as a G-man whose hatred for Affleck's crew courses through his body like motor oil through a piston. Seriously, Affleck is getting to be the Clint Eastwood or Robert Redford of Actor's Equity --- one phone call from him and the A Team shows up at his doorstep. It's all good.

What makes ""The Town"" most memorable though, are its action sequences, masterfully shot by Robert Elswitt. Make no mistake, shooting a car chase in Cambridge is about as easy as parking your car there in daylight hours, only a tad more deadly. It's not photographed showily, just effectively, and you can say that about almost every other element of this film.

It's a throw-back to when Heist movies were about the basics --- simple, violent realism. And that was enough. It hearkens back to the days of Cagney and Bogart, instead of Nicholson and Walhberg.",9
17 September 2022,Unusual and excellent robbery thriller,"Love this flick. I recently read the book and as you might expect, it's even better. Spends less time on the action and way more time with Doug, and how and why he becomes so obsessed with the bank manager. Every character is far more fleshed out in it but the really major plot beats are similar. The movie is a much better than average robbery film with a decent script. Mostly, it's unusual for the genre and handles the action segments far and away better than most anything.

If you're at all curious about a more intelligent and methodically researched and more plausible version of the events, I'd urge you to check out the novel.

6 July 2023,Solid Flick,"Good from start to finish.

Is it the same caliber as 'Heat'? No. But still enjoyable.

Was really impressed by Jeremy Renner.

A different role for him, and he knocks it out-of-the-park.

The whole 'falling in love with the witness' is probably dumb, as to realism. But it's not Hollywood if they don't squeeze a romantic interest into every film.

I'm sure the plot has holes in it somewhere, but none that stick out enough to make you start digging for more.

Ben Affleck is just Ben Affleck. Either you like him, or you don't.

They work in a 4 man team, and it would have added more to the film to give the other 2 guys some sort of attention.",7
6 January 2012,The Town (2010) - Ben Affleck's Double-Threat Movie!,"Ben Affleck directs, co-writes, and stars in ""The Town"", a movie about crime, robbery, and betrayal. Affleck has organized a brilliant cast, a dark script, a clever directing duty, and tons of thrilling moments. Now, although this movie has a few side effects, this is still one of 2010's best films. Ben Affleck stars as a professional bank robber who falls in love with the manager of a bank that he recently had robbed with his team. He tries to juggle his personal life and robbery game, and tries to make sure the F.B.I. doesn't catch him in the act. Ben Affleck really knows how to direct a movie! There are so many brilliant performances in this movie. Besides Affleck's awesome performance, the rest of the cast includes Jeremy Renner in an Oscar-nominated performance as Affleck's robbery partner, Rebecca Hall as the bank manager recently robbed by a gang, the late Pete Postlethwaite as the local crime boss who runs a flower shop, and Chris Cooper delivers a pleasant performance as Affleck's prisoned father. There are some moments to be had, thanks to a dark script that actually knows what it wants to be, and some very cool robbery scenes that make the movie stand out. But, the only problem with the movie is only kept in a minimum. The movie starts off too slow, and starts taking away my focus for half of the first act. But that's when things start to progress, and the movie gets better. This movie is also an hour and a half too long, and some moments were just silly. But I didn't care about that, because this is still a great film. Ben Affleck deserves all the credit given to him for this movie. That just proves actors can be awesome directors. They can make sure a movie has a great premise, a terrific cast, and some thrilling moments. That's exactly what Affleck has accomplished for ""The Town"". This is an exciting and dramatic bank heist movie. ""The Town"", in my review, ""an exhilarating robbery movie, but sometimes dragging"".",8
12 December 2010,The return of Ben Affleck,"""Gigli"". ""Pearl Harbor"". ""Daredevil"".

These are the films which have plagued Ben Affleck's career as soon as he and his buddy Matt Damon won an Oscar for ""Good Will Hunting"". Having a share fair of hits and stinkers, Affleck suddenly disappeared from the limelight, having only a minor but acclaimed supporting role in 2006's ""Hollywoodland"". More than a year later Affleck returned to the public's eye with ""Gone Baby Gone"", but as the director rather than the star. It shocked everyone, particularly cynics such as myself, because the movie was great in its own right. Was this a fluke or is the ""real"" Ben Affleck coming, we cynics say to ourselves.

Well, ""The Town"" proves that Ben Affleck is not only back, he's at the top of his game.

At it's heart, ""The Town"" is a simple crime drama/thriller about a group of bank robbers, most particularly their leader, and how he let his human side potentially endanger the rest of his crew, in the small town of Charlestown, Boston. It's a story that we've seen and/or heard one too many times before, and one can already guess the ending of the story.

Having said that, a story, no matter how similar or different it is, is worth telling. And ""The Town""'s screenplay is written in a careful and constructed way that we get to know more about our bank robber leader and why he is the central character of the story. Using this method we sympathize with him and we root for his character to get out of the mess he's in. This is not original, I have to admit. But his character, and others as well as the entire screenplay, is written in a realistic and believable fashion, as well as giving it a nice Boston touch to it, firmly placing you in the streets of Charlestown. It is clear that the script is a love letter to Boston, as all the dialects and the people are put into account, and they are written well.

Before I get to Affleck, I'll start out with the supporting actors - particularly Jeremy Renner as a trigger happy but not-so-psychotic robber. Renner delivers a great performance and shows the versatility that this man can bring to a character after the calm yet cocky performance in last year's Best Picture ""The Hurt Locker"". Rebecca Hall is the love interest but she shows strong vulnerability as a victim always should, so her performance is realistic. Jon Hamm plays an FBI agent bent on catching the crooks - here he is slimy and manipulative - but determined non-the-less. Blake Lively from ""Gossip Girl"" really surprised me with her acting talents, greatly show a desperate and ruined woman after playing a glamorous character in that TV show. The rest of the supporting actors do their roles with justice, including Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite. All of the performances are focused, realistic, and believable.

Roger Elswit photographs the film beautifully, showing the Bostonian locations in their splendor while also giving a touch of grit to the intense scenes. The camera work is flawless with very little touches of shaky cam, adding a sense of urgency yet spectacle to the action. The editing is also crisp, the film cuts to many moments at the right moments and it isn't quick enough for incoherence like so many MTV music videos, it's just right. As for the production design Boston has rarely looked this great, you can say that this film is a love letter to Charlestown and Boston in particular. The music by Harry Gregson- Williams and David Buckley are suitable for character building moments, and are rightfully excluded for the action scenes to add more tension and unsettledness. Knowing Gregson-Williams tendency for loud music during many of the action movies he scored it is a HUGE relief to see that he has restrained himself here.

Which brings us to the man of the hour, Mr. Affleck. As a star he shows vulnerability, dedication, street-smarts and a gentle, human side to him, who always never panics and always knows how to be one step ahead of the cops. His performance is a vast improvement over his blockbuster runs a decade ago and it is clear that he has learned from his mistakes. Pulling a two-punch here, Affleck is not only the main actor but also directed the film - normally it would be bland for many movies if you can predict what's going to happen next but here Affleck directs the film with such skill, carefulness and confidence, you'll wonder whether a more experienced director is calling the shots. This is proof that while Affleck has improved as an actor, he may be a dominating force in the director's chair in the near future. Affleck handles the action sequences in a focused, simple and realistic fashion, there's no unnecessary explosions and no extreme blood squibs. But when the shootings starts, the tension is cranked to the maximum. It is handled with just the right amount of tension and violence.

Overall, it is a simple story told extremely well with a great acting ensemble, splendid shooting sequences and top-notch direction. This is not an action movie but I was hooked from beginning to end. I know this may be too soon but if Affleck keeps up this streak and choose movies that is of his true caliber, than Affleck may very well be on his way in following Clint Eastwood's steps as a popular actor but an extremely talented director as well. This is one of the year's best films.

Overall rating: 84/100",7
19 October 2010,Above Average Heist Movie,"An above average ""Heist"" movie confidently directed by Ben Afleck who also takes the lead. Set in Boston, Affleck plays a career bank robber, Doug Macray, from the run down district of Charlestown, which is home to the criminal fraternity in general, and bank robbing aficionados in particular. The generous running time of 125 mins contains only three raids because, wisely, the story based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves"", concentrates on character rather than action and takes time to enjoy the location sets in Boston itself.

Charlestown is a tight knit community to which Affleck's gang return after a brilliant, visceral opening Bank raid. To English ears, the dialogue is sometimes mumbled and difficult to follow, but when a hostage is freed who it emerges also lives in Charlestown, the plot bites as MacRay starts to date the hostage and is easy to follow. Time worn themes of criminal codes of honour, redemption, justice and revenge are explored with a blue collar authenticity which just begs Bruce Springsteen to step out of the shadows at any time.

Rebecca Hall as Claire skilfully unfolds the role of bank official turned unwitting girlfriend ,delivering a compelling, but understated performance even though her own back story is somewhat under written. Pete Postlethwaite is wonderful in a cameo as the local godfather in a ballsy performance, in every sense of the phrase.

No such story would be complete without the Cop determined to bring the hoodlums to justice and John Hamm is convincing as FBI agent Hawley whose task in racking down the offenders is not that difficult. Why both he and McCray have to sport unshaven beard growth is never quite explained.

A gripe is the Hollywood obsession with over the top shoot-outs. Although the opening bank raid, and subsequent security van raid are brilliant, the finale at the Boston Red Sox ' Fenway Park becomes ridiculous and unconvincing, and is wholly unnecessary to a well plotted story. Fortunately an action free, but engrossing and satisfying denouement save the story from the ridicule it risks at Fenway Park.

Strong, and atmospheric, with several nods to ""Heat"" this movie succeeds and delivers in spades suggesting that in the future Affleck will make a film that scores excellent, and not just the ""very good"" plaudits which this story has rightly been credited with.

Worth a watch, though.

13 August 2021,"Good, but familiar.","I really enjoyed this movie. In many ways it's fantastic, the casting was great and believable and it keeps you hooked. Affleck does a great job as Director and there's something about movies set in Boston that have an authentic feel to them. However, I think its safe to say that a lot of this movies scenes and plot lines were stolen from Michael Manns Heat. The gunfight in the street, even the acoustics sound the same. The fist gunshot of the gunfight is prety much the exact same shot as Heat. Then the girl at the window with the FBI with her, there are times when the similarities are ridiculous. It doesn't detract from a viewer's enjoyment though, and I guess many movies take a lead from earlier films. All in all, a reality good watch.

16 April 2017,"A Stolen Heart, in The Heart of Robbery.","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston.

14 March 2011,HK Neo Reviews: The Town,"It seems like 2 Hong Kong films that I have seen before Call it déjà vu or whatever, but the fact is clear. The latest Ben Affleck's directorial and starring effort in The Town, seems far to alike to a Andy Lau's vehicle and a separate Richie Ren's movie combined. Sure, the film is well paced, quite entertaining, but one cannot stop thinking about the aforementioned motive. Putting this aside, The Town is actually quite decent, well produced, well directed and a story that is complicated enough to keep the audience at their seats. However, something seems to be lacking to elevate the film further up the scale. The chases are fun, so are the masks (most notably the ironic nun's masks to rob the bank), but one thing that is safe to proclaim is that Ben Affleck is officially a better director than actor. Whenever on screen, Affleck is far too wooden to convince, but the film is extremely well directed.

Basically, The Town tries hard to be creative and goes the route normally not taken by Hollywood standards. However, when put into context, this is really one simple film expressed in a complicated fashion. While this isn't a bad thing, but the characters despite plenty of focus, we feel nothing for. There is no emotional connection that made Affleck's previous directorial effort far more effective and touching. The film also does not seem real and rational. I know love is not meant to be rational, but the guy is a murderer, bank robber and kidnapper for god sake. Will you still want to be with him? For me, this film seems to focus too much on Affleck's wooden range and subsequently even discounting the déjà vu factor, The Town is at best average and nothing more(Neo 2010)

I rate it 6/10",6

16 March 2011,What a ride!,"Thi was just brilliant, i was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This film didn't leave me time enough to try and work out the ending or what was going to happen next. The script was so amazingly written, it must be one of the best films I've seen in a long time, as good as The Departed, without the big name cast, but that isn't to say the actors didn't pull it off.... Affleck was amazing, so was Jenner, who scarred the pants off me... Blake Lively, oh my god she is a talent and played her role perfectly, and believably. I loved seeing another aspect of John Hamm too, he is of course great in his TV show, in which he is so controlled and straight, but this film he played a different character, to great effect. Chase scenes were beautifully executed, costumes were convincing and the cinematography was startlingly sharp. LOVED THIS, cant wait for another from Affleck, who seems to be Hollywood's answer to THE ALL ROUNDER.....

22 October 2010,The Town - Ben Afflick's Smart Action Picture,"It seems that most of us grow up with some version of the family business. Hollywood in itself is a prime example. The Barrymore name has been ever present as long as making movies has been a business. As a child is raised into the family business there comes the time to make the ultimate decision. Do you rebel and become something else? Or do you find comfort in the continuation of way of life? But what is a person to do if there is no way to rebel from the family business without dire consequences.

This is the theme explored in Ben Affleck's new film The Town. Ben directed, co-wrote the screenplay adaption and stars in this film about the most dangerous family business: crime. Ben's character, Doug MacRay, is a crook. His one chance to make a difference in his life by being drafted to play professional hockey was stopped short by his own cocky behavior. Left to live in a crime-ridden area of Boston, nothing was left to do, but go into the family business.

Doug belongs to a crew that orchestrates high stakes robberies in return for great riches. But this crew belongs to the old man that Doug's father worked for and with his father in prison for the remainder of his life, Doug knows that it is only time before he will be joining dad in the pen. It's obvious that Doug is the brain of the crew and his best friend James, played perfectly by Jeremy Renner, is the hot-tempered wild card. After Claire, the witness of one heist gets too close, Doug starts following her to make sure that she doesn't know too much. He moves in to acquaint himself with her and a very touching romance develops between the two. Claire is unaware that this man that appears to be a gentle young man is the same masked man that robbed her bank and scared her to the core.

It's obvious that once Doug and Claire become close that Doug is planning to leave. Only one problem: you don't just quit this family business. With his life in danger from his own boss and the FBI closing in, and his unpredictable friend, Doug finds it hard to manipulate the situation to his advantage. Just when his plan is underway, Claire finds out his true identity and a girl from the neighborhood, a drug addict named Krista becomes too talkative, just all may be lost.

But Doug's dream of a new life and a fresh start with the woman he loves propels him to complete his most dangerous job, and find a way to escape the hold his home town has on him. The rest of the film plays out unpredictable in a smart and intriguing way. Perhaps, for a few of those who have gone down the wrong path, a new and more pure path awaits.

Ben Affleck shines on many levels with this film. His acting along with his cast mates is well executed and all the characters are believable. The script, adapted from the book ""The Prince of Thieves,"" by Chuck Hogan is craftily adapted by Affleck, Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard. The story is well paced and Affleck's direction adds another depth of realism to the film. This is not Affleck's first turn as Director, his film Gone Baby Gone was one of 2007's best film.

This is a great film and should not be missed. I predict that Ben Affleck is on the path of being one of Hollywood's best directors and will have a long presence in Hollywood. His directing method is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's work. For those of you who have not seen Gone Baby Gone, give the DVD a try, you will not be disappointed.

The Buzz: When award season comes around, I don't think The Town will garner any attention. If it does, I see a nomination for best adapted screenplay and /or a nomination to Jeremy Renner for best supporting actor.

12 July 2020,In my personal opinion this easyly one of the greatest movies of all time.,"I rarely ever give a rating this high. But this movie well deserves it. It seriously is a masterpiece in every direction. The acting is unbelieveble, the pacing is smooth, the movie also contains good bit of action, drama, and romance. It is one those movies you watch and are just so upset when it ends because you became so engaged it. Excellent premise, great story, and would mostly definitely recommend it highly as a must see movie.

21 March 2016,Ben Affleck proves himself as director and actor.,"Certain aspects of The Town assimilate Michael Mann's Heat, as do most heist epics since its creation. Luckily enough for director/actor Ben Affleck and all on board there's plenty of new ideas that help the film stand on its own two feet. Heist expert Affleck and his crew, which consists, infiltrate a bank, kidnapping a member of staff in the process. Affleck's oddly infatuated with the kidnapped Rebecca Hall, who's unaware of who her kidnappers were. The Town follows his working life and personal life coming together.

Affleck has scored as both director and actor, creating tension and feud with animosity. Affleck's is humble, the relationship with Hall is cast in romantic misery. Blake Lively's short but bitter cameo as a 'lady of the night', abusing our criminal- come-protagonist, only coming out her shell when FBI agent Jon Hamm muscles in. The person to watch out for is Jeremy Renner as Affleck's harrowing, temperamental partner-in-crime. The scene's he's in are jaw-clenching.

The Town's packs enough heat to keep my interest the whole way through. Well done, Ben Affleck. Gone, Baby, Gone wasn't a fluke.",8
13 June 2023,Very Good Movie,"Rating: 8.5 Good to Very Good direction (Especially when coordinating the heist scenes), Great acting by Ben Affleck, Great to Incredible Acting by Jeremy Renner, Very good acting by the rest of the cast, Decent Story (Good in terms of concepts but bad in terms of plot points, development, and story architecture), very good screenplay, Pacing was extremely fast and hard to follow plot points because of it, the exposition is very unorganized which makes it very confusing what is going on for like the first half of the movie, The final 45 minutes of the movie is great to incredible in terms of the suspense as it builds to the action that takes place, good cinematography, plot elements (resolution is very rushed, The climax is the best part of the movie as it is the most well structured, the rising action is also good as it helps develop the main character and him wanting to go clean, but the exposition, falling action, and resolution are not well executed which make the movie hard to follow and I was not that invested in the characters as we should be). Overall, what makes the movie is the acting by the cast, the action/intense scenes, and screenplay, but what makes the movie not great is the unorganized story arc and extremely fast pacing.",8
10 June 2022,Too long and too dull,"Not sure where the rave reviews came from. This was long and very very dull. Started with an interesting idea and just became boggy and violent. Give it a miss.

15 July 2022,Ben Affleck's Thrilling Crime Tale,"One of Ben Affleck's directing successes is the thieving, boisterous group of friends provide a thrilling watch of crime and love - and how the two inadvertently intertwine.

A proficient group of thieves rob a bank and hold Claire, the assistant manager, hostage. Things begin to get complicated when one of the crew members falls in love with Claire.

Adapted from the novel, 'Prince of Thieves', Affleck's film earned Jeremy Renner a much deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The film entices its audience with its quick pace and slick exchanges, the writing is subtle and even comedic as it allows the cast to bond on-screen. Affleck and Renner are joined by Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively who all contribute to making the film a love story interrupted by heisting habits. Touched on earlier - the script is infectious, it incorporates quirky conversations and contrasts them to loud, laughable scenes of mischief. It is a credit to Affleck for ensuring the film's two paths remain distance through the course of the watch, in order to keep its viewers guessing.

The film first premiered at Fenway Park, with the cast walking on a red carpet along the first baseline. Affleck went to such extremes in crafting the ideal picture; it was his brother Casey who suggested Renner to play James Coughlin and Blake Lively was asked to spend time with the Charlestown locals, so she spent a large amount of time mingling on the streets and in pubs and clubs. Grossing over $50 million its original budget, 'The Town' is a captivating, interchanging rollercoaster of emotions which knows when to speed up and slow down.

Masterful work by Affleck, but Jeremy Renner steals the show!",7
2 September 2022,Love this movie but......,"OK, right off the top I'm a huge huge fan of this movie. I've probably seen it 1000 times. My biggest problem is Rebecca ... She does nothing for me and I have a hard time believing the relationship. I just wish they would've used a different woman for this role. I am not sure if it's Rebecca 's looks, or just the way she acts in general. I just didn't see the connection

I do wish they had shown a little bit more scenes with them to show them falling in love.

I think everyone does a great job! If you haven't seen the uncut version yet I suggest you do.

Blake lively plays trashy girls so well.

4 December 2010,Good enough...but something is missing.,"This movie is definitely not bad. One might say even good, yet there were few things that were missing (or overdone in some way) that prevented this movie to reach the ""departed"" movie status. It's a crime drama. Story is simple yet it works every time. There is a lot of shooting, personal drama, love feelings and even a bit of sports. In general this is what every movie needs to be good. Now for the things that were missing or overdone. Ben Affleck. There were way too much of Ben Affleck on screen. Frankly despite the fact he's not bad at all, but he's not a grade A movie star who can carry a movie to the top. I found his overacted monologues a bit irritating. Story is a bit too simple - Obvious secondary (""bad"") character death at the end, and a shot of redemption for the main one. It felt as this movie is too ""politically-movie"" correct, as all the ingredients are there, but they are not cooked properly. This one is worth to watch never the less.

19 December 2010,Undone by weak romance,"This is one of the better heist films of recent years. The cast is strong and look of the film is gritty and realistic. The weakness is the romantic subplot between the team leader (Ben Affleck) and a hostage (Rebecca Hall). Their entire relationship was implausible and they shared little on screen chemistry. Since the ""Townies"" are depicted as working-class people sharing intense loyalties and clannish devotion to their Irish code of honor, I would have preferred to spend more time with Affleck and his team, particularly his loose cannon best friend, Jem(Jeremy Renner) and Jem's druggie sister. Their relationships and significant history (Jem's family cared for Affleck's character when he was young and he was romantically involved with Jem's sister) were more interesting to me than anything that occurred between Affleck and Hall. The heist build-up and action were terrific, but since so much emphasis is placed on the romantic storyline, the film isn't as good as it should be. A solid effort with a terrific cast.

30 September 2020,Ben Affleck showing that he knows how to direct,"A setback in a bank robbery puts the elements of a gang in Charlestown, near Boston, at risk. This film is one of the best examples that Ben Affleck is, for the most part, a better director/ screenwriter than an actor.

The plot is the typical heist/gang most of the time, but it has the right pace so that the enthusiasm does not start to fade over time, and it manages to be constant and maintain the right balance between the dramatic part and the action, as well how to see the points of view of criminals and authorities, and then ""judge"" the methods of both and have an opinion on who rules for the right reasons.

The cast is fantastic, especially with the performances by Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm and Pete Postlethwaite. It is not at the same level, but it is not far from the classics 'Heat' and 'The Departed'.

21 December 2010,"Solid story, but not a character driven one.","I heard a lot of great things about The Town, both from friends and critics here on IMDb and so I had great expectations for this one when I popped the DVD in. I wasn't entirely let down, but wondered why I found myself forgetting the film right after wards. I didn't want to discuss it right away, it wasn't boring, but still felt like something was missing. But, the film isn't entirely forgettable because I am after all; writing a review on it.

Reasons why the film has it's merits, is in the action, and script. Affleck sure knows how to put together a story. He's a proved script writer with his gold statue and it's his strong point. His directing and acting however, could use work. I would have liked him to cast someone else in the lead role. He can do well in a supporting job, but never once did he steal a scene. And it's not because He's a bad actor. It's because he isn't convincing as a villain, there's just something angelic about him. In my opinion, he was miscast in this film, he should have cast someone else. When the lead actor doesn't fit or act his way into the role written for the character, the good script could wind up being meaningless. It's hard to find the energy to direct and jump into scenes, and it showed here. Ben was just lacking energy I thought. Luckily, the supporting cast was excellent, especially the ""Wild man"" Jeremy Renner. He put a lot of energy into his role. I also loved the job Blake Lively did, she has just gained a fan. Everyone else also did a decent job, but nothing that sticks with you.

The directing was OK, found myself wondering why there were some scenes in the film, and why the timing of some scenes also appeared off. This is no directorial masterpiece by far. But once again, this negative is off set by the great cinematography, in which I loved.

Oh, and the action. This should have been an action movie, and less of a character drama. It would have been better off if Ben wrote it that way, but nonetheless, worth a watch. It is an old school action film which is refreshing, but in this high tech time we live in, old school films should have more of an emotional impact like ""State Of Grace"" That film is a classic, not sure if The Town compares to it. Or even ""The Departed"" for that matter. Nevertheless, a solid rating because I just think it still belongs along those 2 films in the same breath at least.",7
26 September 2010,Affleck blows my mind again...,"The Town- Some of the best directors were former actors: Clint Eastwood, Robert Redford, Mel Gibson, and now the name that pops into my mind when I think of actors turning great director is Ben Affleck.

The Town is about a long-time heist criminal named Doug MacRay, played by the director Ben Affleck, who falls in love with a former hostage and now witness for the FBI with the only information that could get Doug's crew thrown into prison for life. And as if that wasn't enough drama, Doug's best friend and fellow crew member James Coughlin, played by Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker), is a trigger-happy box of loose screws that is more than a little upset about Doug's new girlfriend and the fact that he wants to leave their hometown, Charlestown, for a simple life together in Florida.

Pursuing Doug and his crew is F.B.I. Special Agent Adam Frawley, played by Mad Men's John Hamm. Frawley is the classic asshole fed that we always see in the movies but with more of a dark-side. He doesn't exactly follow the rules and he has no qualms with shooting first and asking questions later.

As if that cast wasn't impressive enough, add Blake Lively, Chris Cooper, Titus Welliver, and Rebecca Hall as Doug's love interest and you know you're going to have a good time watching this.

The movie 'The Town' is based off of Chuck Hogan's novel 'Prince of Thieves' and while I have not read this movie I must assume that after watching this movie that it will be just as much as a thrill-ride.

I first got a taste of Affleck's directing skills when I bought the movie 'Gone Baby Gone' on recommendation from a friend. It quickly became my favorite movie which led to me reading the book by Dennis Lehane who quickly became my favorite author. So already, I was excited to see Affleck's next work.

The Town is what we like to call a ""comeback."" After Affleck did Gigli he was cast down on the mountain of fame left to do short cameos in films like Smokin' Aces where he was killed off in the first twenty minutes. And then in 2009 he was given a small role as a stoner in the Jason Bateman film 'Extract.' But now Affleck has reached the mountain peak again with his new movie at the top of the box office.

Who would I recommend this movie for? Well not for children, but everyone else, sure. While it may be a ""man's"" movie with hardcore action and plenty of violence to keep you cringing in your seat, there's still a thick plot and a love story being told within the film. The love story is enough to make female go ""ooo-and awww"" but not enough to where the men feel uncomfortable. I have to give Affleck one big piece of credit, this movie isn't a Jason Bourne, it's not anything with Jason Statham. It's not an attempt to get the blood rising and then leave you hanging. Ben brings you the thrills you want, but he never loses touch with the story and he always keeps the plot engaging and realistic.

With strong performances from all the cast, especially Renner, I have to say that this movie is definitely top notch. And for you ladies, there's a scene where Ben is doing some chin-ups, and it's obvious that Ben's been working out because his abs possibly rival Ryan Reynold's.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had everything a good movie needs: Action, Crime, Humor, Romance, and a little bit of nudity. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and I'm excited for Affleck's next directed movie.",10
4 April 2022,UGH. Ben Affleck,"All of the actors are superb with the exception (of course) of Affleck who can't act his way out a paper bag. If this film is supposed to pull the heart strings, it fails miserably. Sorry, I just can't feel sympathy for life-long criminals and their families who are also life-long criminals. Horrible movie, which is what I'd expect from Affleck. Too bad some of these great actors (e.g. Renner, Hamm, etc.) are wasted on this piece of trash.

4 December 2010,Finally a movie i can hold high with Heat!,"I still don't understand all the criticizing that happens with Ben Affleck's directing and acting abilities, i mean their are a hell of a lot worse out there. I for one have enjoyed pretty much all with the exception of a few of Affleck's movies and acting performances. I am also a huge fan of a good heist film but really haven't seen a half decent one since '95's Heat. That was until i sat through this intense little stick up flick. Ben Affleck seems to be doing the directing thing as well as a lot of actors have been, i mean there is nothing wrong with trying something a little new now and then and he is good at it, first Gone Baby Gone and then this. This film is huge in talent let's see we have Pete Postlewaite, Chris Cooper, Jeremy Renner that round out the cast as well as Affleck himself who portrays Doug Macray an experienced thief who along with his team have made it a habit of taking down huge banks in the charlestown area, an area that is re known for producing bank robbers such as himself. In an accidental mishap during a heist his crew end up taking bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage until they make their getaway. Doug ends up getting into a relationship with Claire after being told by a member of his crew (Renner) to take care of her which i guess he does in his own manner. Doug and his crew are chased throughout the film by the FBI as he tries to pull off one more job and still try to run away with Claire as to which i will say no more only that it has a great shoot out scene within that rivals Heat. A great film that even Affleck haters out there should have a look at as they might just change their whole position on this underrated actor.",10
19 March 2021,Ben Affeck still finds a way to entertain in his Sophomore effort.,"I would say I was more impressed with how ""Affleck"" paces his characters in, and out of frame to his advantage. I would admit that the story doesn't nearly grab me as much. I think most of the reason is, ""Boston"" man growing up slowly realizing his home town is eating him away. It all feels overly familiar, like we have heard ""Affleck"" subconsciously explore this before. Even if we haven't seen it from him yet.

29 September 2010,The Town? More like A Town. A Boring Town.,"Highly disappointing and highly overrated. Based on ratings and review I thought this movie was going to be an amazing hit like Departed. Oh boy was I given a let down. The acting was not particularly great and the storyline was bland -- the only story ""twist-up"" involves the girl who was part of the bank being robbed and one of the robbers eventually date her without her knowing the truth. However, the way this was written was of complete and utter disbelief. Nonsensible actions were partaken by the lead antihero played by Ben Affleck, and further nonsensical actions were partaken by the girl he's dating.

I understand that it's part of an action drama to include unbelievable events like crazy explosions and car chases, but to actually piece the storyline together through incredulous and unbelievable actions just causes the audience to not appreciate any of the ""important"" scenes and happenings in the film.

There is absolutely no suspense, no thrill. The action scenes were also really plain, stuff that we've also seen in the theaters since Lethal Weapon. I mean it's not terrible, but it's just not really anything unique or attention grabbing. The movie score was plain too (by the way, I don't know why they used Eminem's Not Afraid song in the trailer) and failed to drive any emotion, but maybe it was just because the story in itself was far too mediocre.

Watchable, not bad, but certainly not worth $12.50 at the Brooklyn movie theater. The movie was also excessively long. A boring 5/10.",5
12 December 2010,Robbing banks while in love,"'The Town' is a heist movie with a heart. In simple words Robbing banks while in love. Sounds quite contradictory to be in a single movie, yet 'The Town' pulls off the tricky plot very impressively.

Doug MacRay (Ben Afleck) and his gang are professional robbers. They are specialized in bank robberies and armored car robberies with precision planning and no evidence left behind written all over the case. Doug unexpectedly falls in love with a manager from a bank where he has robbed earlier while trying to stalk her with doubts of she must have identified the robbers. As to expect his buddies and the underworld gang lords does not support him at this and in the mean time Doug having second thoughts to give up his trade for good and start a new life with the lady. 'The Town' is an action packed thrill ride in every robbery scene it brings in. And equally romantic in scenes where love blossoms.

A good story combined with good cinematography & acting 'The Town' is a different movie to speak of. It's a movie about feelings, uncertainty and expectations which hard to pull off. And yet proves that people can change in the brink of something better to live for.",9
24 April 2019,Sequel to The Village,"This is a good movie. Renner and Affleck give good performances, and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout. Enjoyable, but not super special or memorable.

18 September 2011,"The movie contrasted the relationships between a bank robber and his group against his feelings for the bank manager, and his attempts to outwit an FBI agent.","The movie contrasted the relationships between bank robber Doug Macray and his group against his growing feelings for Claire Keesey, the bank manager, and his attempts to outwit FBI agent Frawley. The plot was well executed even if it was a little predictable. Ben Afleck gave a great performance as the conflicted Macray while wearing the second hat of director. The character was fed up with his life as it was and wanted to improve it, but didn't have much incentive.

The idea that Claire could fall for him was a stretch but was convincingly justified because he was there when she needed someone. The action scenes were engaging. Just when the bank robbers seemed to have their backs against the wall something happened to change the situation. Blake Lively showed her acting skills in her portrayal of an addicted ex-girlfriend that was still not over Doug. There were a few unexpected twists, one being the scene where he was talking to Claire on the phone about meeting with her. It was her response that I didn't expect. His friendship with Coughlin led me to believe the film would end differently. It was a very entertaining film.",
17 June 2012,One of the best i've ever seen,"The town, I got the movie from the local store with a whole lot of movies. Honestly i didn't know anything about the movie. I looked at the cover photo and just trew it on to my cart. To be saying the truth i didn't know anything about the movie.furthermore i never even know that it was a Ben Affleck movie. Saturday night i invited some of my friends over and play it on the computer. The Opening of the movie was an absolute nail biting. we were in the edge of our seats.However, the middle part of the movie got a little bored so most of us felt asleep. And i started to expect a useless. But in the end the movie just blew my mind off with great thrill and a good story line with a touch of romance. I loved the movie so did my friends. This movie was the topic of our next week we talked and talked about it over and over again. I never really imagined Ben to be a good director. And honestly he wasn't one of my favorites actor. bet this movie proved he was a talented actor than what we saw fro him in the past decade. And to see that he directed the movie just freezed me

13 April 2022,Star Studded Cast Sort of Delivers!,"Overall I think this film was pretty entertaining but still just a ""good"" movie. It was constantly enjoyable mostly due to action and intense dialogue. Ben Affleck and Jon Hamm both do great jobs, but the rest of the cast can feel shaky at times especially the women unfortunately. Characters like Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively) seem one-dimensional and not very thought out.

Its a decent film to watch with some friends but not really worth seeing again.

24 August 2012,A Nice Watch,"After the success of Gone Baby Gone, this is the second movie by Ben Affleck. The movie is good in bits and parts but on the whole it fails to live up to its promise. Though it is still much better from most of the other movies that have been released this year, it is not as edgy and thrilling as Ben Affleck's directorial debut. The best performances in this movie are given by Claire(Rebecca Hall), James (Renner) and Krista (Blake Lively). It could have been another memorable movie if it was handled in a better manner. A good thing about the movie is its music that is one of the highlights. Ben Affleck needs to make sure that his movies are edited in a better manner as that will do real justice to his talent as a good Director.

26 February 2011,The Town,"If you're looking for a action film that tells a good story with developed characters, then look no further than 'The Town'. For the past couple of years, Hollywood have been spitting out rotten films with predictable stories and flat characters. But now, we have this film which while it holds the typical credentials of a Hollywood film E.G the ending and at times whiny love story, it manages to shy away from the audacious crap spews out from the teats of Hollywood's money cow Ben affleck as an actor is like marmite. Personally i'm not a massive fan especially after the gobble gobble anecdote but thankfully in The town he is at least bit likable and while the film progresses, secrets begin to unveil and you start to have some affection towards him. As a director, well this is where he really shines and his first two major films rambunctiously showcases his talent behind the camera. He knows how to pace a film, knows how to capture the atmosphere and most importantly , knows how to shoot some fantastic action scenes.

This film will hook you straight from the start. Towards the end you will be rooting for Affleck. If anyone could pin point an leak in the story, it would be why a guy like Doug, would risk his own freedom to make his unaware victim happy. Of course, you could say i'm being argumentative seeing that his true shelf is revealed but one could easily say the story is OTT.

Anyways, There enough attention to character to keep you hooked and enough action to keep the visceral eye catching",7
17 January 2011,Blake Lively as a hooker? Seriously?,"I just finished watching this movie, and it was simply worth to watch. The movie was not just crime movie, it contained some human drama, and shooting the movie from view point of the criminals definitely made the movie one of a kind.

Despite the fact that most of people probably think the best part of the movie is the human drama, my best part of this movie is the exciting gun fights. The machine guns were basically used in the movie, and for me who was getting bored with the recent movies' dull hand gun fight all of the gun fight in this movie was definitely worth to watch.

However, I have a reason to put 7 on this movie, which is Blake Lively. I'm not one of the haters of her at all, I even like her and her acting, and I'm not gonna criticize her performance here. But she plays a hooker? Come on, even if she had a heavy make up, still she is too hot to be a hooker, don't you think? I know it totally depends on person's taste in women, but it seems to me she is even way hotter than the heroine in the movie! Anyway, if you want to see super awesome gun fight, I definitely recommend this movie to you!",7
8 October 2010,"When Crime, Love and Redemption intertwines.","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",8
27 May 2015,"""I'm proud to be from Charlestown. It ruined my life, literally, but I'm proud.""","In his second time directing, Ben Affleck demonstrates once again his skill both in front of and behind the camera. In the unique setting of the neighbourhood of Charlestown he creates a great film held together by strong characters and an authentic environment of the crime ridden Charlestown.

We follow criminal Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), part of a group who carries out many high stake bank robberies. After taking a woman named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage to ensure a safe escape, Doug follows her into a Laundrette to discover whether she knows anything. But as he talks to her he begins to care for her and slowly begins to have feelings. These feelings mixed with his guilt over the harm that his life of crime can cause others and the FBI drawing closer he begins to want to leave Charlestown and start a new life with the woman he loves.

Affleck performs well as the lead whilst juggling both his directing and writing duties with a very restrained performance of a man longing for something different in life. He comes across as very likable in spite of his crimes and does get over the difficulty of balancing his loyalty towards the town and people that raised him with his new found love and longing for a normal life.

Though the highlight of the film is definitely Renner who plays a fairly psychotic, but surprisingly sympathetic character. He plays James Coughlin, a man who is like a brother to Doug who shares an unspoken loyalty with one another willing to put their lives on the line for one another. In spite of this loyalty they are also both very different people with Doug's longing to leave the life of crime contrasted with Renner's acceptance of it and a true product of the criminal underworld. Whilst Affleck's character is often hesitant on harming others, James is constantly prepared for it bashing in a cashier's head for speaking out of turn and being quite ready to kill their hostage at any risk of getting caught without even giving a second thought.

But this film is more than just about it's characters. It's about a place called Charlestown in Boston, which the film states in its introduction that it breeds more bank robbers and armoured car thieves than anywhere else in the world. It's a dangerous environment to be raised in when everyone around you lives such a life it leaves a person with little choice to do otherwise. This is exactly what made Doug MacRay who he is in the film. He's not a bad person, but he's put in an environment where he had no other choice but to turn to a life of crime or betray his father and friends. Even when he tries to leave it seems as if his friends and employers keep sucking him back in like a dark pit with no escape with people like Coughlin keeping him trapped in the world of crime.

On top of his ability to create convincing human drama on screen, Affleck also demonstrates his skill as an action director with several memorable heists throughout the film. Each heist keeps an intimidating atmosphere through the gangs use of threatening masks and the feel that they are in complete control of the situation making them come across as real professionals.

The heists also incorporate an interesting element often overlooked in heist films which is the psychological intimidation being one of the most effective weapons. Whilst pointing guns and yelling certainly creates great threat, for a guard to hear the name of loved ones or their own addresses the level of intimidation reaches an entirely new level. This combined with the impressive shootouts and driving sequences demonstrates how Ben Affleck has really evolved as a filmmaker.

Whilst his career had dipped before, this was a real sign that Ben Affleck was deservingly back in the highlight. He made a great choice of material to work from and uses his expertise as a filmmaker of knowing how to work with his actors along with his ability to keep the story fast paced and exciting to make the film a real standout.",8
18 November 2010,Ben Affleck redeems himself,"Charlestown, Boston is not your ideal holiday destination, nor is it a place you'd want to raise a family. It 'boasts' the highest number of kidnappings and armed robberies in the world. For many of its inhabitants, crime is sadly a genetic trait.

Ben Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a stonemason who moonlights as an armed robber. Like him, his gang is disciplined, dedicated and dangerous. During a routine bank score, one of the managers, Claire (Rebecca Hall) is left traumatized. Fearing that she may somehow implicate them, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), the capricious one, decides that she should be murdered. However, after a chance meeting with Claire, MacRay is moved by her vulnerability and an unlikely chemistry develops between them, prompting MacRay to examine himself.

For once cops aren't dim-witted. FBI agent Frawley is every bit the crime-fighting force he should be. His real life name (Jon Hamm) may suggest otherwise, however, his performance is more lean than streaky. Pete Postlethwaite's cameo as the cadaverous Irish linchpin will unnerve you. His cover is as a florist, but there's nothing flowery about his character.

Watching this film, I was reminded of Michael Mann's 'Heat' and John Frankenheimer's 'Ronin'. Affleck would not be able to deny that his gunfights and car chases were inspired by both films, but he wouldn't have to: they have a flair of their own. The only cliché I noticed was a superfluous exercise scene, but it was so brief as to be almost subliminal (the sight of an outrageously chiselled six-pack is hardly a criticism).

Affleck has partly redeemed himself with this film. Only 'partly' because further penance is required before he can be totally absolved for the sins that were 'Gigli' and 'Pearl Harbor'. Along with his directorship of 'Gone Baby Gone', 'The Town' is a not too tardy reminder that he once won an Oscar for his ability to tell a good story.

14 October 2020,One of my all time favorites,"I recently had the chance to rewatch The Town and just like I had previously thought, I loved it.

The cinematography is breathtaking. The heists and chase scenes through Boston are incredibly executed. The writing is beautiful. The cast is top notch. It has everything movie fans are looking for. I won't spoil anything about it, but do not miss this movie.

It should be noted that Affleck is not only a great actor but an incredible director. This was his follow up to Argo. He has a vision that you can't teach, and being a Boston native made him perfect for this job. I'd also advise to check out the directors cut if you have a chance. The theatrical release is just over 2 hrs and the directors cut is about a half hour longer. It has some important detail that the studio felt the audience didn't need.

Enjoy.",9
23 April 2011,A very competent character driven action thriller,"We have come a long way from the paparazzi filled ""Bennifer"" days, Ben Affleck increasingly deciding to spend his time on the other side of the camera, directing films.

Here he gets to play on both sides with a character set very much on his home turf, Charlestown, Boston, apparently the bank and armed robbery capital of the US.

""I'm proud to be from Charlestown. It ruined my life, literally, but I'm proud."" - Charlestown Man, Boston Globe Doug MacRay (Affleck) is the son of a bank robber and appears to have inherited these skills from his incarcerated father (Chris Cooper). With all jobs bizarrely masterminded and bank rolled from the local florist where ""Fergie"" (the late and much missed Pete Postlethwaite), acts as a brutal puppet master for all things illegal.

Following another successful raid with his ""Skeletor masked"" lifelong buddies and crew, ""Jem"" (Renner), ""Gloansy"" (Slaine) & ""Des"" (Burke), it becomes necessary to ""manage"" one of the bank witnesses taken as a hostage. The pretty, spirited and understandably traumatized Rebbeca Hall (Keesey).

Whilst bumping off witnesses is not high on Doug's to do list, he is after all a living oxymoron, a caring bank robber, his somewhat psychotic cohort ""Jem"" has no such scruples.

Doug pacifies the requirement to do something by befriending the witness on the pretext of learning what she knows and this rapidly turns into a relationship. Much to the concern of ""Jem"" who also sports an easily identifiable tattoo noted during the robbery.

There is much to like here, the action scenes are believable and well staged in a urban style that ""Heat"" pioneered. The interaction between the characters is believable and the dialogue rings true. The group are actively and almost obsessively pursued by FBI agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) who again presents a seemingly realistic portrayal.

Blake Lively (Krista Coughlin) adds some ""trailer trash"" vulnerability to her character as Doug's casual ex, in love with him for all the wrong reasons.

There is an obvious feeling of inevitability that this cannot and will not end well and it is obvious that hard choices, disappointments and loyalties will be questioned. Doug remains trapped within an imagined destiny, knowing he should break away whilst weighed down by inertia and guilt.

There are flaws, seemingly the robbery crew can spray police cars from point blank range with automatic weapons with little or no discernible casualties. The tattoo reveal is somewhat wasted, being replaced with yet more hi tech firefights which is disappointing bearing in mind the good plot ground work that has come before.

Renner shows again he can act and Affleck is solid and certainly does not let the side down in his dual role. Postlethwaite proves once again what a fine actor he was but if there is a stand out, Keesey shows a very impressive mix of vulnerability, steel, hope and disappointment, in a role that will do no harm on her CV.

The film is slightly let down by an over busy and noisy denouement, subtlety would have had a more profound effect. However, as a director Affleck remains someone to watch, he can and hopefully will do even better but this is a solid effort.

Summary

A very competent character driven action thriller with a great story and some solid performances.

23 September 2010,Go see The Town,"I saw The Town, last weekend and it lives up to its hype. I love Jon Hamm from Mad Men, and he gets to show his acting chops as an FBI agent, with his own demons, chasing a gang of Boston bank robbers. Hamm's character, SSA Farley dubs the gang the ""not effing around"" gang, because they are ruthlessly efficient in throwing the authorities off their trail. The gang hails from an area of Boston called Charlestown, known for producing bank robbers, a ""skill"" passed down from father to son.

The police and FBI are fairly certain they know the members of the gang, but there is never any forensic evidence to tie them to the crime scenes. Ben Affleck does double duty as director and, plays Doug McCray, also known as the Architect, because he plans the heists with absolute precision, so that no one gets hurt and they don't get caught. Of course there is always the crazy, reckless guy in the gang who is itching to shoot someone, and James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) fills that role admirably. He plays crazy very well. Why is it that the sane gang member is always beholden to the crazy gang member in some way???

The plot centers around a bank job that results in Coughlin ""tuning up"" the manager, giving the assistant manager, Clair Keesy (Rebecca Hall) an opportunity to trip the silent alarm. McCray sees her do it, but doesn't let on and Coughlin decides to take her hostage for them to make their getaway. They let her go after they escape, only to find she lives in Charlestown a few blocks away. They fear she somehow might identify them even though they were heavily disguised. None of the others have the stomach for murder, but Coughlin starts talking ominously about ""taking care of her."" McCray assures him he will handle things with Claire, and in the process falls in love with her. Claire doesn't recognize him and still bruised from the trauma of the robbery, is drawn into a relationship with him.

The local mob boss then taps the gang for the heist of a lifetime at Fenway Park the morning after a big game. McCray at first refuses, but after they threaten Claire, he agrees. Can McCray pull one last job, get the girl and change his life? It's a tall order, for sure.

Ultimately the film is about redemption, with some justice mixed in for good measure. In the end McCray, despite the bleakness that defines his life, hangs onto hope, and ""hope"" as someone once said, ""is a good thing.""",9
12 January 2011,Gun Shots And Flower Pots,"A lot of people give Ben Affleck a lot of hate for his work. For his acting, it is totally justified, but for his directing it is quite the opposite. I went in seeing The Town expecting a not so great film because I have not seen too many Ben Affleck features. However, I still gave the movie a chance.

To my surprise, I liked it. The cast is pretty stellar with the likes of Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, and Affleck himself. The two worlds of good and bad are depicted clearly, as Affleck rides the fence separating the two. But also to my surprise, Pete Postlethwaite has a medium-sized role as the twisted flower shop owner which in itself blew me away. He shows so much frailty yet summons so much intimidation with a single look. Absolutely fantastic.

Toward the end a memorable action seen ensues to finish the movie off with a bang.

I have no idea what anybody else was saying when the said Ben Affleck couldn't write nor direct.

Rest in Peace Mr. Postlethwaite. Thanks for another memorable role. Cheers!",10
16 January 2011,"Sure, why not?","Yesterday, I saw the South Korean crime film ""The Chaser."" I spent 2 hours staring pale-faced at the screen. After it ended, I stood up with my head in my hands, drew a ragged breath and stumbled out into the hallway.

""The Town"" won't have that effect on you. The standard Hollywood grammar signals you from behind every frame, so even as cars slam into each other and crates of bullets sink into brick and metal, none of the russle and tussle on screen catches you particularly off guard. The people you expect to live - live, the people you expect to die get offed in genre-appropriate ways. The character that was going to hang it all up gets pulled into ""one last job,"" the feds are tipped off by the person you expect to cave under questioning, and so on.

That being said, there's nothing wrong with a formula movie done well, and Affleck delivers. The movie is well-shot, well-written, well-directed and well-acted, with individual nods to everyone's new favorite trigger-finger Jeremy Renner, and Pete Postlethwaite, reduced in body, who makes up for the lost volume with concentrated Kobayashi malevolence. This was Postlethwaite's last film credit to see release before his death, and he plays it like Slayer's farewell concert.

Bostonites would be in a better position to comment on its authenticity, but the movie does give a good sense of location and flavor. Between ""Mystic River,"" ""The Departed"" and now this offering, Boston has been working up a somewhat gritty reputation in the movies, though Detroit and Baltimore are laughing and shaking their heads.

All told, this is a perfectly fine formula caper movie with an almost-authentic blue collar burnish. You could do worse on a snow day.",7
25 February 2020,Gotta love a good Boston movie!!!,"There have been many good movies made in Boston recently such as The Departed, Boondock Saints, Mystic River. I can say, this movie was very well done. The cast is fantastic, the acting is great and I believe this is an accurate portrayal of Charlestown and the people that are raised there. Ben Affleck did a great job with this movie. The action scenes are raw and amazing.

21 December 2011,WOW...awesome movie...will be re-watched,"Wow...I mean really wow, this movie is one of the best character driven action films in a long time. This is right up there with Young Guns, Public Enemies and Heat as far as excellent cop vs bank robbers. If you liked The Departed or Public Enemies...you will love this movie.

First a warning, mild nudity, violence and Lots of F bombs. Not that I am complaining in fact the way this part of the world (Massachusets) uses the F word is almost an art by itself.

Props must be given to Ben Affleck here, He Wrote this movie, Directed this movie and Stared in this movie. Jeremy Renner fits perfectly into his role as ""pain in the A$$ always in trouble best friend"". And Jon Hamm is brilliant as the FBI guy out to get Affleck. Even the smaller parts Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper are outstanding.

The plot is flawless, moves at a nice pace while not giving itself away. The prep and shooting of this movie shows off the greater Boston Area in a great way including giving props to Fenway Park. The action is outstanding without being ridiculous (hard to do with today's action hungry audiences).",9
27 September 2021,Okay heist movie,"This movie is a a fine average bank robbery movie of one who decides he doesn't like the life of a criminal and tries to get out but cant. A robber falls in love with a cop and things get complicated and screwed up in the end. Decent heist movie, but a little dissapointing.

9 February 2016,A street smart invigorating action crime thriller on the unrealistic side,"This movie is fast paced for the most part, and very satisfying when it comes to action, thrills, and just a tinge of drama. The main cast gives a convincing and chemistry bound performance, in a story set to depict a inner crime-wave stricken Boston focusing on the inside (and criminal) perspective.

While the film gives well executed scenery and action movement, it strays too far outside the realm of plausibility, and falls to closely to the crime-drama movie cliché. It lacks the realism depicted in say, Good Fellas, but will give you action sequences that rival that of the Departed.

27 September 2010,Make way for Ben Affleck. He's arrived...again.,"This movie proves that Gone Baby Gone is not a fluke by Ben Affleck. The man is definitely talented and we can expect great movies from him in the future as well.

The Town, although comes across as a heist movie, is an intense drama in lives of the criminals, the law enforcement and the victims. Ben and Jeremy were Doug and James throughout the movie. They were their characters till the end. I thought Jeremy Renner was great in Hurt Locker. In this movie he's nothing short of perfect. John Hamm, Mad Men fame, is adequate given the role. He did a fine job. Blake Lively is eye candy on Gossip Girl and in The Town is all that and then some. She gave an extraordinary performance and looked very hot. I wish her character was a bit more longer. Rebecca Hall had a tough role to play and she did justice to her role.

The background score and the camera work are great. The action scenes are splendid and were realistic and not gravity defying for a change.

Now, let's talk about the captain of the ship, Ben Affleck. The screenplay and the direction are impeccable. The story is wafer thin but the execution is great. There is never a bad scene or a bad action sequence in the movie. The movie maintains its pace for the full 2 hours. Ben did an amazing job of getting the best out of his cast and is therefore a very successful director of one of the best action/drama movies this year.",8

19 July 2015,A very well developed drama,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",9
31 August 2013,My Kind of Town,"Switches from 'seen-it-in-Point-Break' to some genuinely tense moments, and from occasionally jarring accents to some sharp and sassy dialogue. A good cast is headed by an on-form Affleck and an engaging Rebecca Hall, with a solid and likable Jon Hamm, and a suitably on-the-edge-of-control Jeremy Renner – but they are all outshone in his brief moments on screen by a peerless Pete Postlethwaite. It's a good crime drama, not centring on the mechanics of the job, but on the personal relationships that drive events, and that elevates 'The Town' above other crime thrillers of recent years, making it highly watchable.

18 September 2010,Give Affleck a Chance,"Ben Affleck has had many ups and downs in his career. Some people love to hate on the guy because of some of his choices and the crap he has been in (Daredevil and Gigli). The Town however, is an excellent movie. It really does not do anything that we have not seen before in any other heist movies. What does stand out about it are the characters. That is where Affleck sets himself apart from many other mediocre directors. In The Town they made characters that the audience cared about. They made us care about the bad guys when they were getting shot at. It is a tough thing to do to make a bad guy the center of a film and have the audience care about him.

Jeremy Renner is great in this movie just like he was great in the Hurt Locker. The rest of the cast does an admirable job as well. The relationship development and the shot at redemption are what truly set The Town apart. I believed Affleck's performance, and I believed his direction of the movie.

28 September 2010,Two hours of very entertaining cinema,"The Town does not disappoint. I live in Boston so I watched it with a very critical eye. Charlestown is as different from Boston as the Bronx and Queens are to NYC. For the most part, everything seemed authentic to me. This film has it all. A good story,great action sequences and for the most part, the Boston accent is not murdered. I generally cringe when I hear the accent in the movies as it is never correct and always over the top. The robberies and car chases are expertly filmed, but it is the relationships of the characters that truly mesmerize. Ben Affleck does a great job of not only acting, but directing this very enjoyable film. As a matter of fact, every actor in the film did a great job of making their character believable. Ben Affleck is a fine director, no doubt about it after viewing this film.

The tension builds well and the action sequences are pretty engrossing. Ben Affleck's character engages from the start. A good film.

16 June 2023,"""Tangerine""","The Town is a crime and action film based on a novel titled Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan. The story follows ""A proficient group of thieves rob a bank and hold Claire, the assistant manager, hostage. Things begin to get complicated when one of the crew members falls in love with Claire."" (IMDb). The film is directed by Ben Affleck and screenplay is by Ben Affleck, Petter Craig, and Aaron Stockard.

As always, Ben Affleck proves himself as a creative director and writer with a great vision towards any story, script, or film that he is a part of. In this film, u can clearly see some great sequences especially in terms of the action ones. This film is a heist film, and every single heist sequence was very very well made in terms of the action sequences or the camera movements and the choices of the camera angles. From low angle shots to establishing shots that uncover the chaos that the gang is causing around.

Ben Affleck as Dough, Jermey Ranner as James and John Hamm as the FBI detective are the only 3 actors that grabbed my attention in terms of playing their role perfectly. Sadly, Rebecca Hall's character Claire is a very interesting character but the actress did not add anything unique to make it interesting, same facial expressions added with a boring and dull acting. Ben Affleck's character has a very dark past that the film revisited by not even showing it, rather by talking about it. That's something that was very well done in which the acting, directing, and the script has helped so much in achieving that.

On the other hand, in my opinion the film can easily be 1h 45m rather than 2 hours and a half. In that case that rushed pace in 1h 45m that it would have, would make no time for boring and unnecessary sequences to happen. It would've been more fun and more interesting.

The custom design is very amazing, they really pulled off every outfit they had whenever they were doing a robbery.

My rating is: 7.5/10.",7

22 January 2011,"Welcome Back, Mr. Affleck","It's no surprise to anyone that Ben Affleck has been off the map for quite some time, despite minor roles in other movies lately. Could it be that putting on that different hat, the director/actor one, was the change this guy needed? As a director he made his point with 'Gone Baby Gone', but now I must say he deserves a standing ovation for 'The Town'.

Who knew, right? I mean, the guy was puked and mocked in tabloids, and I won't mention what me & my fellow comic-fans thought about his Daredevil stint. Honestly, I don't give a rat's behind who he dates. Let me judge his acting instead. Well, add directing now, too.

This movie simply blew me away. As a director, Affleck took me to Charlestown, where you can almost taste the downwards spiral of mess the characters find themselves in. A raw picture, raw characters, and a raw story. As an actor, Affleck and his co-actors convinced from the start, you just want the 'bad guy' to succeed. And those accents! It gave that little bit extra, without overdoing it. At times you would almost think of the plot twist possible with Jon Hamm. Luckily this isn't the last movie that will feature Pete Postlethwaite, but he did one heckuva job as usual. Jeremy Renner portrayed that zealot the story asked for. I was surprised to see 'Gossip Girl' Blake Lively in the movie, as well. To me, she was bit of the weak link in the ensemble. I felt she did a good job, but didn't convince me as much as the rest did. Almost as if she tried to hard. Rebecca Hall however was a positive surprise. After in my opinion, forgettable roles in major productions, she gave us a character to remember.

All and all, Affleck made the movie into one of my favorites.

Good job.. Welcome back.",9
1 April 2011,"'The Town' is a complex, engrossing thriller","Directed by Ben Affleck, based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan, The Town takes place in Charlestown, Massachusetts. It is a heist/police thriller about four masked bank robbers--Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James ""Jem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert ""Gloansy"" Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond ""Dez"" Elden (Owen Burke)--who wind up taking a hostage during a robbery--the bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall). They release her, blindfolded. Unsure whether Claire might somehow be able to finger them, Doug pays a visit to her (her not having seen him) and asks her out on a date, which turns into a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is tailing the four suspects.

After seeing this film, as I was stepping out of the theater, an elderly man who just walked in, asked me, ""Was it good?"" I replied with my first two-word review: ""Very good."" He said, ""Okay!"" For some, that short-and-sweet review would suffice. For the rest, the following is my longer version.

If you have seen the trailer, it appears to be the standard Hollywood plot—the sympathetic villain falls in love with the hostage, betrays his own guys, and maybe end with an elaborate hail of gunfire, and so forth. It's the general plot line for films that involve professional killers—This Gun For Hire, The Killer, The Professional, Bittersweet Life, etc. Luckily, this film is more complex. In fact, the love story doesn't take that much of the center stage. The story looks more into the environment, the people, and the relationships that form a person. Advertisement

In terms of style, this film could be considered a close cousin of Heat and a second cousin of Point Break, but with more drama. The action scenes have an efficient coldness to it that makes it look realistic. As impressive as the action scenes are, this film is mainly character-driven. Ben Affleck's direction is top notch. The pacing is nearly flawless. The car chases through small alleyways of Boston is reminiscent of French Connection. The gun-fights are loud and gritty. The film has just enough small surprises and cleverness that makes it unique. The characters' back stories, their history, and the crime culture bring an extra bit of dimension. The dialogue is frequently witty and playful. I suppose it helps that the story was based on a novel.

Ben Affleck is understated and solid as Doug MacRay, the planner of the heists. While it is not an unusual role for Affleck playing the sympathetic one, he feels like a real person. His relationship with his jailbird father played by Chris Cooper adds an extra dimension. Particularly noteworthy is Jeremy Renner's intriguing performance, which invokes an unnerving unpredictability to the character of ""Jem,"" Doug's close friend and cohort. Renner's character is nearly the opposite of the soft-hearted hero he played in The Hurt Locker—here, he is creepy, erratic, and has no problem killing people off.

Overall, this is a character-driven, solid crime thriller with good direction from Ben Affleck. The performances are first rate and while the action is strong, the film's focus on human drama is what brings this film up a notch. I couldn't quite predict where the film was going. The pacing is good. It's been a while since I've seen an engrossing heist thriller like this one. It's good. Okay, very good.

12 March 2020,Heist movie at it's best,"One of the best heist movies ever. Because it's not about action and cool scenes it is a very good drama movie with good direction and perfect performances. Usualy novel adaption films are not good as the novels itself but this one is so great that you won't even like the book after seeing this. Actors did their best works when they are giving life to their characters. Affleck proved that he is A+ writer, A+ director and A+ actor. Action scenes were awesome, they felt like movie has a blockbuster budget. Well done Boston guy!

10 May 2015,Very well made movie,"Heist, escape and again, on the course of time if you smell the problem in your way then going to get it right, but what if you get close with that same problem and seems as if stuck in dilemma, one last work that turns out bit wild and wrong which ends up the bond that was strongly fragile!

2010's ''The Town'' is one such kind of theme that had been adapted plenty a time but though this stuff seems to be fresh and neatly crafted, the dialogues strikes the liveliness into the plot, well scripted and properly screened cinema is this, Ben Affleck the true hero behind this, this multi-talented filmmaker seems very ease and well planned with his idea, the execution of the story has that involving flow and never falls anywhere in between.

Environmental factors play a prominent role in molding our personality and is one of the significant reason on which one could predict the consequence of once act, ''When I was a kid I used to go to Wizard's ice cream, it was across from JJ's Bar, that was where all those big armored car guys hang out, and they were like Rock stars in neighborhood there were lots of kids in ice cream shop'', this touching phrase has very impact to show on the character's traits.

Along with Affleck Jeremy Renner, Corena Chase, Blake Lively all of them had rendered their perfect and neat performance, action sequences and the art direction behind the disguise are very good, best piece of work from Ben Affleck and team.",7
19 September 2010,"Average heist/action movie is not bad, not great.","""The Town"" is OK, though nothing special, really. I just don't, or rather can't ever buy Affleck or Damon for that matter, as leading men. They simply don't have the skill, charm, or charismatic appeal of the seasoned pros for my money. In my opinion, their strengths are writing, producing, and directing. Those things and Robin Williams' performance is what made Good Will Hunting a good movie, not Ben nor Matt's acting abilities. The other thing that needs to be pointed out, is that the movie is based on a best-selling novel, which is basically almost always a sure-fire hit at the box office with a pre-built-in audience; which amounts to taking the safe road. The story is superb, and an added bonus is the authentic Boston location shots (although if you are a Bostonian, you can easily pick out some of the flaws in the location sequencing. During car chase scenes, for example, one frame they are in the North End, the next it is Bay Village, then Beacon Hill, back to the North End, etc. all within seconds. I know this is nitpicking, so that really is not a big deal. Of course, it is great to see Fenway Park in any movie and this one is no exception and delivers. Even though I did not read Prince of Thieves, (the novel that the film is based upon) there were quite a few times when I got the feeling that too much license may have been taken with story incidentals and plot development for the sake of the action-movie dollars and for fans of Affleck's work. The music soundtrack is almost non-existent or not very memorable, sounding at times like what used to merely be referred to as ""stock"". Jeremy Renner (who steals the show), Rebecca Hall, and Jon Hamm are far more interesting to watch than Affleck here, and their performances are about as solid as it can get in an action/heist drama of this sort. Is it a bad movie? By no means, if you ask me. Is it a great movie? Certainly not, in my opinion. Maybe as an inexpensively priced matinée, it succeeds, but I am happy that I was not prepared to pay top dollar and wait in a long line to see it. Although I had no expectations entering the theater, I still exited feeling that this is one of those films that is probably best left to DVD, cable, or large screen in the comfort of your home. As a heist movie, it is no ""Killing Zoe"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", or ""Reservoir Dogs"" that's for sure. Give Ben Affleck a few more years or miles under his belt as a dramatic actor, and he just may someday develop into a great actor/director who doesn't feel the need or desire for so many close-ups and takes of what amounts to, well, Ben Affleck's rather limited repertoire of Ben Affleck faces.",7

This was a good film that might have slipped through the cracks. The balance of the cast did splendid work. They included Jon Hamm, Blake Lively, and Titus Welliver. The style of this movie reminds me of The Departed and Boondock Saints. The climax had a nice mix of action and drama. The ending wasn't the typical 'Hollywood' ending you'd anticipate. Overall, this was a pretty decent picture.

16 March 2022,"""I'll See You Again. This Side or the Other.""","Sometimes, the middle of the road is not a bad place to be. Sure, most would probably rather be on one side or the other, scaling great heights or rummaging around in the dumpster of cinema - these places leave an impression and form indelible memories. But there's nothing inherently wrong with middle of the road films either: boilerplate, competent, well-paced, and without tedium. Sometimes, this is as good a place as any to be. This is where The Town is.

The film follows Doug MacRay, played by Ben Affleck, as he leads a group of bank robbers in Charlestown, Massachusetts. In a spur of the moment decision, James Coughlin, played by Jeremy Renner, takes a bank assistant hostage which leads to further complications. There are questions of staying in vs. Getting out, loyalty, lessons learned from relatives past, and a high-stakes game of cops and robbers thrown in to really kindle the flames.

It should be noted that the film only gets better as it goes on. It starts slowly (aside from its opening sequence) develops slowly, and introduces the principal characters slowly, but there is a breaking point when The Town hits its stride and never slows again. The last act is a job on Fenway Park, a climactic and twisty sequence through the bowels of the park and out the other side. Many isolated threads of the film entwine here, making for an engaging, edge-of-your-seat bloodbath, which is fun. I wish The Town had found more time for fun.

Despite the measured acceleration of the plot, the film feels hollow and sanitized. It's a character study with a flat, well-meaning, and mostly unblemished central character, and a love interest just as bland and common. The premise of their love is contrived, and the film tries to compensate for this contrivance by donating a large chunk of the first act to their story, which is unsatisfying and inorganic. The chemistry just isn't there.

Other characters don't get off cleanly either. It's ironic that the appeal of The Town lay mostly in its pulse-pounding action sequences, where the best laid plans of our central robbers go awry, because I often found myself rooting for the cops, many of which are slain in the line of duty by our inherently greedy, selfish, and psychopathic quartet. Affleck tries valiantly to pin the wrongdoings of our band of hardened thieves on the city itself, making clear how frequent and commonplace bank robberies are in Charlestown, but it only ever feels like a shallow excuse to make coldblooded killers into protagonists.

Despite the character's shortcomings, Renner does a splendid job of bringing Coughlin to life, an effort which earned him an Academy Award nomination. The acting all around is mostly full of stoicism and posturing, with the exception of Renner and Pete Postlethwaite, who plays a vicious, heavily Irish florist. He has the upper hand of being intentionally hateable, which makes him, by default, the most interesting character in the film.

Ultimately, all of these disparate parts and elements make for a so-so time that, thankfully, only gets stronger as it chugs along. It could've been more atmospheric (Affleck's Charlestown would've benefitted mightily from some Scorsese-esque New York grit) and tighter all around - tighter pacing, tighter build-up, tighter editing, tighter characters, tighter middle act - but it's a solid, competent film.",6
27 February 2011,Good watch but highly overrated movie.,"I could explain this plot in detail but it's kind of familiar. It involves robbery, guns, and death. It also includes some great actors and they fit their parts well. But you already knew that.

I've seen this before....not once, or twice, or thrice, but a million times under Martin Scorsese or mimicking directors of him.

This was a great watch yet I really got board. I thought the movie would escalate in to something a little bit better than what I had seen but it never climbed above any thing else.

If this is your kind of film. I recommended it. If it's not don't waste your time.

19 September 2010,A surprisingly great flick,"Like most of you here, I was very skeptical towards this movie. No way Ben Affleck can pull out something that's even half way decent. So before walking into the theater, I was actually trying to hate on this movie. I went in expecting the worst.

I remember it was a Friday evening. As I walked through the dark corridors to where they are showing the movie, I realized one thing. I realized if something goes wrong with the projector or the stereo, I can get a free pass for another movie. There I was hoping the above mentioned to happen. Please let the film burn out. Please allow the rats to chew that wire connected to the stereo.

I closed my eyes as a brief introduction on Charleston starts playing. I knew this 2-hour picture will slowly kill my eyes. I didn't want to go blind, not over a starring-Ben-Affleck video. But then I have paid $7 for the ticket. I couldn't allow myself to waste $7, so I decided to endure two hours of torture and pain, so the rest of humanity doesn't have to.

A couple of minutes in, we see a bunch of people in skull masks, let's say, repossessing cash which supposedly belongs to the bank. Early on we're already looking at predictable characters. You know one who is unorthodox and mentally off ; one who's clam and nice; and then there is always the damsel in distress. Never seen that before. And then somehow, the FBI would like to investigate on this robbery even though the crew works within the state. Nope, not the cops, but the feds. Of course we need a character from the ""good side"". There we go, a special agent who is a prick. Good.

That is pretty much how the synopsis goes. Bad guys do bad things. One falls in love with the damsel. Good guy tries to stop the bad guys. So yes, the storyline is far from innovative. At this point, you're probably hesitating on actually paying for the ticket. Same old storyline starring Ben Affleck. Hell it's even directed by Ben Affleck. It's OK to be pessimistic towards this movie.

As the movie keeps playing, I can't help but start having this idea of it being a rip off of the infamous Heat. You know the one with Pacino and De Niro, directed by Mann. What I didn't realize is, when I start drawing comparisons to the one and only Heat, this movie is actually good.

I ended up enjoying the movie. Yes, I went into the cinema wanting to hate the movie, and I ended up giving it an 8/10.

What truly made this joint good is its presentation. Like I said, there's nothing that made the script stood out. Ben Affleck did a hell of a job on giving us what we want to watch. Good shootouts, good suspense, interesting relationships. These are what we want in a drama film that doesn't have exceptionally good writing. He did just that. Well the sex scenes sucked but they only last for around 2 minutes in total so you can just look pass that.

The actors did a fine job. However, I would like to specifically point out that Jeremy Renner has the best performance as the sociopath in the film. He successfully became the character and put up an extremely convincing performance.

There is a great amount of adrenaline-pumping moments in the movie. Lots of shootouts as mentioned. These shootouts are executed flawlessly, though not perfectly. Sound effects are nicely done. Somehow Ben managed to keep emotions running high throughout these scenes. You will want someone to be killed. However, it's wasn't done perfectly because it was lacking intensity, somehow. Yes you want someone to get shot but you don't feel the intensity. Don't ask me why. That is the feeling I get from these scenes. Perhaps it's the environment setting or the characters aren't moving enough. I don't know.

One of the larger problems is the character writing. Like I said, the characters are pretty much what you expect from a movie like this one. That fed, however, is unnecessarily not likable. The writer sculpted him as a prick but we don't get to see how does that affect anything. You just hate him because he's rude to everyone, making it impossible to root for him. What made the Heat's plot extremely interesting is allowing the viewers to be able to root for either the cops or the robbers. The Town could have done the same thing here, and I would have seriously thought about giving it a 9/10. But then, it didn't, so no 9. To sum things up, this movie is a great one and you should go see it. There is still no argument on whether if it's right up there with Heat, but it's good enough to draw comparisons. By the way, the ending is extremely uncalled for. Be prepared for that.",8
15 July 2018,The details are what matter here.,"This is a movie about a group of thieves in a town of bad history about thieves, and of course we see their interactions to the surrounding community, the police and the victims of their heists.

But the story is not the core here as it's very simple related to other heist related movies, however the excellency of this movie stems from paying much attention to the details; the details in the accent of ""Charlestown"" citizens, the details in the costumes which made for us that unforgettable scene of the robbing nuns, the details in making such strong plot with the least weak points.

The length of the movie is a little bit extended without any good reason, it starts well with a great action scene then the rhythm goes up and down till you reach the end which may not be liked by a lot.

The performance of the actors is really great and you see them in new characters and they nailed it specially ""Ben Affleck"" & ""Jeremy Renner"". On the other hand, ""Rebecca Hall"" & ""Blake Lively"" could do better and ""Jon Hamm"" didn't fit that much in the role.

Finally, it's a nice crime/drama movie that the director -who is ""Ben Affleck""- paid much attention to everything except for the thrill which could be added in a bigger amount here,you will enjoy it till the end if you overcome some boring moments.",7
19 September 2010,Is the Town a remake of Set it Off?,"Okay not saying it wasn't good but you must see Set it Off which came out in 1996. You can watch it online or rent it. The Town is 14 years too late. Set if off has the same characters with almost the same exact story lines. Ben did a great job directing it and acting in it. The other characters were great as well. The movie is an intense ride. But when its been done, its been done. I wonder if they considered the similarities before making it. I also heard that the movie is based on a true story but still. Set it Off wasn't a small film. It was nominated for several awards. Sorry I don't get how this is something new when Set It off was far more original and interesting. I gave the movie a 5 because of originality or lack thereof. But again it is a good movie to see but the hype is a little much.

24 October 2010,"A subtle homage to ""Casablanca,"" with a twist","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston.

16 January 2011,Best Bank Robbing Movie,"The town is an excellent movie. Gripping, hard edge and brutal is what

I would describe the movie The Town.

The Town is one of the more better bank robbery movies I've seen so far.

It's suspenseful, violent and is filled with plenty of action and car chase scenes.

Ben Aflect does an excellent

job playing a bank robber who falls in love with a bank manager that he had previously held hostage.

The Town is sure to make a good bank robbing classic movie.",10
28 May 2015,Ben The Storyteller,"I think this film is on par with ""The French Connection"". The main reasons are the realism, and that the human drama does not dominate the plot. We know enough to care for the characters, but never to the degree of forgetting that it is indeed a Boston story, and not a story of these individuals. Ben Affleck is successful directing this film, mainly, I presume, because he is a true appreciator of a well-made film. This film does not pretend to intellectually analyze Boston and its crime-related history. It does not even try to present itself as a great film. It simply tells a good story that grabs our attention for two full hours. As a foreigner, I feel strongly that such characters exist and roam around the city, especially in those days. That is how good the film is. Another personal surprise for me is that I have no urge to read ""The Prince of Thieves"", which this film is based on. Normally, I feel like going to the book that inspires a good film. I simply feel adequate about the story and in no mood to know more. This is a success as a film. No need for other supplements to make it worthwhile or meaningful. New filmmakers should learn from this film. You do not need to turn the world around yourself in every piece of film you make. All you need to do is to find a good story, write it nicely as a film, and make the damned film for the purpose to entertain and make us feel. If there is any more morals, we the audience will point out for you. No need to put anything down our throats. I respect you for respecting the art of filmmaking, Mr. Affleck.",7
6 March 2011,Funny Face Masks,"""The Town"" is fairly standard cops and robbers cinema -- enlivened, however, by color-rich shots of Boston and its once down-and-out neighborhood of Charlestown, the Town of the title. The Bunker Hill monument, Fenway Park, and assorted second-floor walk-ups never looked so good. Ben Afleck and Jeremy Renner play a Mutt-and-Jeff pair of local mobsters, the tall one pensive and troubled, with a dad in the pen and a mom who left him as a kid, the short one just mean and trigger-happy. Renner well deserved his best supporting actor nominations in 2011. The level of violence throughout is convincing.

Afleck improbably gets involved with the comely bank manager of the gang's most recent heist, played here by Rebecca Hall. She tends a communal garden, so you know she's sensitive. That sets up a contest for Afleck's character's soul in which the FBI, its special agents having apparently abandoned snap-brimmed fedoras in favor of T-shirts that read ""FBI,"" intervenes. It all ends predictably, but getting there -- thanks to Affleck's direction and the cinematography -- is more than half the fun. Eight stars.",8
15 March 2021,One of the best movies I've ever seen involving bank heist,"Movie was spectacular from the Narrative of the story to the acting to the soundtrack to the ending credits great acting job all around, real Boston flavor this is my favorite Ben Affleck movie period, great direction and the ending scene was authentic, loved it

3 March 2019,"If You Like to Root for Bad Guys, Then This is Your Flick","Entertaining with an all-star cast, but...

Humanizing bank robbers and their culture isn't exactly my cup of tea, and that's exactly what this movie attempts to do. The main characters are hardcore criminals who deserved a life sentence or a bullet to the head. They're psychotic, and not worthy of empathy. Life's tough and everyone has a story. Nothing diminishes or excuses their violent behavior. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this is a Ben Affleck film.

29 September 2010,"As good as Gone, Baby, Gone","Let me say, I was excited for this movie but I doubted I'd like it. I did. And I don't like movie that have robberies in them, they're mostly boring.

This movie is not supposed to be good. It's directed by and stars Ben Affleck and it has TV stars and a guy that almost won an Oscar. But The Town is a good movie. who would have thought...

The actors do a fine job. Really fine. Ben Affleck is good, he's never been better on screen. Blake Lively surprises as Krista, the single mother / drug addict, Jon Hamm does his best with a character that should have had more screen time but the real star is Jeremy Renner. Renner has always been good, he has an unbelievable presence on screen and he manages to bring humanity in his character Jem. The scene in the graveyard with Affleck is filled with electricity, both Affleck and Renner are just that good in that scene.

I can't say that there aren't any bad things. It felt a little clichéd from time to time and I would have done something different for the ending and there are some scenes that I would have shot differently, I would have also given more screen time and more character to Lively's Krista and Jon Hamm's FBI agent. These were fine characters but they felt thin because you didn't feel the real effect they had on things.

But there are scenes that I bow to. The car chase, you know what I mean, was really good. I was out of breath after it. And the flashbacks where we see when Rebecca Hall's Claire is blindfolded and walking on the beach - like a breath of fresh air. The shots of Boston are heavy and those scenes are fresh and beautiful.

I won't say anything about the plot, go and see it, it's worth it. Seriously.",8
8 October 2011,A great Heist Movie,"The plot however is not brand new to the movie world but Ben Affleck has presented it with great efficiency. The story is about himself playing Doug MacRay and his criminal life with his three partners and how it gets a turnover after he meets Claire. The start of the movie is pretty good and raises our hopes for whats going to be next. I watched the extended cut and may be that's why it felt boring somewhat and long in the latter first half. But soon after that it picked up too good. Jeremy Renner playing James Coughlin has delivered an amazing performance and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well. The screenplay is very good and on the whole its a great robbery movie. The movie surprisingly connects emotionally as well. The character development is superb. Ben Affleck clearly has done a terrific job here. The action sequences and the heists all look real and are shot with much perfection. Watch out for the climax as it may not end how you had thought. Overall its a must watch for crime lovers especially.

27 September 2010,"A decent storyline, good action sequences - a nice surprise!","Surprised at how good this film was to say it's Ben Affleck directed by Ben Affleck. His lead performance was almost a case of 'less is more', he played a moody, quiet type pretty damn well, nowhere near as annoying as I've seen him in other movies.

Elsewhere there's a decent performance by Rebecca Hall as Affleck's love interest, Jeremy Renner is as annoying and aggressive as his trigger-happy role dictates and Jon Hamm is a convincingly over zealous FBI Agent (although I struggled to take him seriously after his 'pretty bubble' role in 30 Rock but that's just a personal view!).

The storyline is good - well structured and the action sequences are definitely edge-of-your seat stuff. The only thing which I found let it down, and this is a minor quibble, is the ending, as in right at the very end. A tad too soft and touchy feely for me I'm afraid. If this film was just a little bit grittier it would have been a cracker, as is it's well worth a watch and is a great surprise - Well done Affleck.",7
17 May 2015,"Much to Say About This ""Town""","Say what you want about him, but Ben Affleck does have the acting chops to pull of various amounts of roles. In ""The Town"", he shows us through directing, writing and acting credits just how much of a talent he is and what he can offer us in the upcoming Batman V. Superman.

It's now 2015, so it took me 5 years to get around to this movie, and I have to say it was a welcome surprise. I've never been to Charlestown and don't know if the crime is accurately portrayed in the movie, but if it is, it's the kind of story that helps you connect and understand the robbers, why they do what they do, how it's a taught behaviour, how it's all part of growing up in certain places, how it's a legacy business.

I switched this film off thinking about money. Money is just paper, and all these guards and police, why are they putting their lives at risk for paper? Why are robbers being shot and killed . . . for paper? Isn't that an insane thing for humanity to fight over, for people to be killed over? Not all the robbers are saints of course, but they're not all bad either. The FBI in this movie came off more like the villains for me because they used every slimy, ratty method they could to try and bring these ""bad guys"" down.

This film is rich in its ability to show a different kind of class than many would be used to, and gives an insight into why some people take the path of lawlessness. I highly recommend it for people who like to see different sides of the fence.",7
19 September 2010,Surprisingly good,"And not for the reasons most people talk about. I was very skeptical given the plot which made it sound like just another tired heist movie with the lovable hood trying to get out of the game only to get pulled in for one more big job (yawn!). Sure, all those elements were there along with all the shooting and chasing you'd expect. Good cast, acting, directing, aerial shots, special effects; the works. But the one really unexpected thing that really made it for me was the great dialog. Lots of really sensitive touches that really sell the story. I'm not such an action junkie but I'll take more of this stuff any day.

Oh, BTW, watch for Jon Hamm as the main FBI guy. He's been in some nice little fun movies but I never really noticed him before now. He's really quite fun to watch and I'll be hoping to see him get more big parts like this one. Nicely done all around.

10 July 2020,The Town,"While ""The Town"" is a very run of the mill crime film, as far as plot structure, subplots, and character types. The fact that Affleck is from Boston helps him form the story and its background, along with its dialogue, a lot smoother. While there is a touch of tenderness, love, and power built between Affleck and Hall, the film falls flat at its characterization, as the characters are recycled types fro previous films. Affleck does a solid well done job, offering the deeply flawed, stuck in his heritage, past mistaken yet wanting to change guy, who gets out the in the end, but pays the price. Hall as the banker just feels very generic. Her character is very typocasted and one dimensional. Renner plays the typical gun go at em hothead, who is all about loyalty. Despite the typocasted character, he gives the most memorable performance, delivering is lines with some raw power and grit. A film that takes the look at the Irish-American crime brotherhood that spans between decades and families. The film contains themes loyalty, second chances, morality, and the price to pay for your mistakes, even if you change. Its action scenes are pretty thrilling as well. It's a entertaining, intriguing, and thrilling film, that plays off its strengths of the fact that Affleck uses his Irish- Boston background, to create the raw and authentic feel. Yet it's still a very generic, carbon copy, character typed film, that you'll watch again, but its nothing special. The script is pretty average, for a film like this, but maybe a little above due to a few brillantly written and acting scenes. The film had moments where it couldnt have risen to a higher level of grit and intensity, but just didn't quite get there.",6
16 September 2012,"Clown piece says, ""Get off ur high horses""?","And gives 'The Town a 2/10. That's just a ridiculously moronic rating; Even if someone didn't like the movie that much. I mean on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best movie you have ever seen & 0 being the absolute worst; There are a ton of movies that are terrible and deserve 1's and 2's etc..

Any1 giving this movie a 2/10 is only doing it because they don't like Ben affleck. PERIOD!! Get over it. The movie is pretty good. And give me a break about the ""rip offs."" Why, because their was a bank robbery like in heat and the girl winked like in heat and they robbed a bank in masks like they did in point break? News flash Bimbo, ""point break wasn't the first movie where bank robbers wore masks. Hundreds of thousands of movies have been made; And a lot are about the same things. Therefore, obviously your gonna have some movies having similarities with others. Doesn't mean, ""Ripping off"" u knumb skull, LoL!!!

27 December 2020,A Charlestown Crime Story,"Ben Affleck directs, stars in, and wrote the screenplay (with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) for 2010's ""The Town."" To no one's surprise, the film is a Boston crime story about Charlestown bank robbers, based off of Chuck Hogan's 2004 novel, ""Prince Of Theives."" The plot centers on blue collar criminal Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) trying to turn his life around after he falls in love with Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), an upscale victim of his most recent heist.

Keesey does not know that the man she's dating is the same guy who recently put her through such horrors. Meanwhile FBI Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) investigates MacRay and his entourage, as MacRay's best friend and criminal colleague, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) prepares for the next job. The film offers rich excitement and the unique Boston flavor that Affleck is known for. It is not unlike the director's previous use of the same city in 2007's ""Gone Baby Gone."" This time, however, he ups the local ante with a Fenway Park heist at the film's climax, epitomizing how the director has retained his roots while growing to embrace larger scale operations in this sophomore feature.

All actors in the film deliver stellar performances. The ones who stand out the most might be Jeremy Renner and Blake Lively, who play brother-sister Charlestown natives with tough, unapologetic outlooks on life. For such conventionally glamorous actors, they play these downtrodden personas strikingly well. They are still pretty, but in much rougher ways, demanding kudos for the hair and make-up departments as well.

Few of the characters are good people at their core, but thanks to a good script, they all have their empathetic elements. From beginning to end, no one is entirely without sin. Nevertheless, we somehow want the best for all of them, especially Affleck's character who possesses a clear heart of gold despite his criminal past.

As far as Boston crime movies go, ""The Town"" might deserve a silver medal behind Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed."" In contrast to Scorsese's epic, ""The Town"" operates on a much smaller scale, following lower-level criminals with no empire outside of their own working-class neighborhood. It also distinguishes itself through its ending. As always, I will not give anything away, but the conclusion displays something other than cynicism. For a crime movie, that alone demonstrates something new to the age-old genre.",7

19 September 2010,Affleck belongs BEHIND the camera,"Ben Afflecks decade long fall from grace was almost a thing of beauty. In 1997 having written and starred in the smash hit Good Will Hunting Affleck, along with co-writer and co-star Matt Damon, was seen as one of Hollywoods great new hopes. But the curse of having ""next big thing"" preface his name in almost every interview for a year struck Affleck pretty badly. Matt Damon chose some great roles to further his career and has given us some excellent performances. If you don't agree with me, watch the criminally overlooked The Informant!, Damon's portrayal of idiot Mark Whitacre is on a par with William H. Macy in Fargo.

Ben, on the other hand, went on to act in some truly awful films, hitting his lowest point in what is arguably one of the worst films of this decade, Gigli. At that stage it seemed all the votes were in and counted; Ben Affleck just could not act. A somewhat solid performance in Hollywoodland did little to change peoples minds about his acting ability. Then in 2007 he stepped behind the camera for Gone Baby Gone, and his younger brother Casey showed us who had the real acting skills in the Affleck household. However it was the surprisingly good direction of Gone Baby Gone which caught a lot of peoples attention. Surely the man who played a plank in Pearl Harbour could not be such a competent Director?

The Town, like Affleck's directorial debut, is an adaptation of a novel. The story centres around Afflecks character Doug MacRay and his criminal friends living in the blue-collar neighbourhood of Charlestown, Boston. Together they form a team of bank robbers with a 100% success rate so far. MacRay knows that his luck may not last so decides to do one last big take before leaving Boston forever. His friends and family seem to take this as an insult and do everything in their power to make him stay. During his next heist he takes bank manager Claire hostage but eventually allows her to go free unharmed. A chance meeting in a launderette re-introduces the two, although obviously she doesn't recognise him. The two begin a relationship and against his better judgement he begins to fall for her. In the meantime his friends and family begin to resent the new MacRay and plot to bring the criminal out in him again.

Comparisons to The Departed are plenty and justified. The three bank heist scenes also echo the gripping action of Michael Mann's Heat. Whilst the one-last-job storyline is somewhat hackneyed, it is the direction and acting which make The Town a must watch. Like The Departed the cating of the supporting roles is close to perfect. Jeremy Renner does a fantastic job playing MacRay's unhinged best friend, James. However the character is a little close to William James in The Hurt Locker and once again shows that Renner needs a more challenging role to really show us what he is capable of. Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper, as expected, give stellar performances and, in the scenes they have with Affleck, expose just how little on-screen presence the man really has. Whilst The Town will hardly make us reassess our opinion of Ben Affleck's acting abilities, it does show us that when he steps behind the camera, he's a man to watch.",7
21 June 2011,Heist in the Town,"All the heist movies have more or less the same story - bunch of tough guys (sometimes an odd girl with mannish persona) plan together to pull out the perfect crime. Everything goes on fine with a hair line finish. And finally some goof up happens. An idiosyncratic intelligent cop gets to the root and nabs them. One of them dies heroic and the other surrenders. Well, there are some movies where the thugs are never get caught, but you can expect a sequel of it soon.

What distinguishes a good heist movie from a bad one - is the ingenuity of the plan.

The town is not ingenious but rather it has got a romantic angle to it. Rest predictable. I was not a fan of Jeremy Renner in The Hurt Locker, but in this one, he impresses. Ben Affleck directs himself and Rebecca Hall pretty well.

Watchable, if not memorable. Masks were good.",7
17 December 2010,"The ""Awesome"" Town","I would give this a 10/10 had there been more scenes of the very talented Blake Lively,not only is she beautiful,but she really did perform her character really well.. So other than Blake,what else stood out,obviously the ""gem"" that is Jeremy Renner,and Mr Affleck,not just for his acting,but his direction in this movie is mesmerizing. I don't do many reviews here in IMDb,although I love reading reviews here, so this really does show that I appreciate this movie.

You might feel that you probably have seen movies like this,and you are probably right,it is not some brand new idea,it is a simple movie with simple plots done RIGHT,there's the thing that will differentiate this movie to others,it is done near perfection,the dialogs,actions,plot lines,everything just done right,I've always found heist movies fascinating,though most of them rarely brings the emotion The Town brings,so for this I will have to say it is among the top movies of 2010,probably only below Inception.

I hope Ben Affleck could receive another Oscar,preferrably one that is not shared,he really deserves one.",9

26 January 2011,Excellent Crime Drama,"Well what can I say well done Ben Affleck this was probably the best film of 2010. The acting was magnificent, action scenes intense while at the same time being quite dramatic and keeping you wondering what's going to happen next. I watched the extended cut which was quite long (148 mins) but I wasn't bored at all, I felt sucked in the whole time..very well directed and the supporting cast were perfect. I think we can expect more great things from Affleck if he continues rolling out films of this caliber. I Did enjoy and will watch again for sure, a lot of people are saying it's a rip off of the film ""Heat"" I guess I can see a similarity but who cares this film is just as good. If you are into gritty crime drama's with excellent story lines then this one is for you for sure

12 June 2011,Real Irish Action,"Ben Affleck directs ans stars in The Town, an involving, gripping tale of bank robbers in Charlestown, Massachusetts—a ghetto neighborhood outside of Boston. The film starts off with a written introduction, explaining that Charlestown has been home to more bank robbers than anywhere else in the United States. With a realistic and chilling first scene of robbing a bank, the film doesn't stop building itself up until the very end.

Ben Affleck plays a bank robber, and the leader of his particular gang. While robbing the bank in the beginning of the movie, they take the manager, a young lady, hostage and leaver her a few miles away. After one of the robbers realizes she lives right down the street from him, Affleck goes to intimidate her into keeping silent. However, when he talks to her, he finds himself falling in love. It sounds cliché—and it is—but this doesn't impede on the intense drama and action that Affleck has so wonderfully created.

The first robbery in the film has an extremely nightmarish feel to it. From the exaggerated angles to the Halloween masks the robbers wear, the scene oozes creepiness. The second robbery, which takes place about halfway through the film, has one of the most intense chase sequences ever to be put on the big screen. And the masterfully crafted climax keeps the audience at the edge of their seats. Affleck gets his suspenses just right: giving enough to induce stress, and supplying relief just at the right moment, unlike many action films that drag on far too long.

I have always admired Affleck as an actor. His portrayal of George Reeves in the under rated film Hollywoodland was one of the best of the decade. Now he is a sensitive man who lives in a harsh world. As his character gives a small glimpse into his childhood, there is a distinct melancholy that comes out in him, and lingers just under the surface for the whole film. The entire cast has a melancholy to them, highlighting the Irish roots of the town. It is a place of shattered dreams, ruined lives, and rag tag mobs. Jeremy Renner is wonderful as Affleck's best friend and fellow bank robber. He is a stereotypical low life: he drinks too much, he spends all of his money, and he is just a plain bad person. Yet, one cannot feel like Affleck's character and come to like the guy.

The love story remains predictable and rather boring until about halfway through the movie, and the side plot of Affleck's crack-whore ex girlfriend is a bit unnecessary, but they juxtapose the almost unpredictable and exciting outcomes of the final heist.

The film's tone helps tremendously in making it original and interesting, and Affleck's direction of the robbery scenes are the most suspenseful in years. With the blending of so many different ideas, and the originality of the film, it is near impossible to pin it down into any one genre, and it makes for great entertainment.

19 December 2010,Movie looked great,"I am going to tell you this. I seen the advertisements for this movie. They were out about the same time as the movie machete. The movie starts out pretty good. The thing that gets me though is that it is nothing more than a love story. I felt ripped off. However the movie overall is not bad. It has a decent story and pretty good acting from the characters. I just don't know how a many men in a laundry mat can say a few lines to a respectful women and take her out the same night and be made into a love story. the movie is too long and drags out so much the last half hour. If you are a girl you probably will like this movie. However I wanted a real movie so machete is what I will be watching instead.

27 January 2019,Great!,"The Ben Affleck saga is well chronicled in these reviews. Pretty boy hunk, to blockbuster star, to paparazzi darling, to yearly ""razzie"" nominee. I'm not sure the ""razzies"" were warranted, by his movie choices got decidedly weaker as his star was falling. Eventually he took some strong supporting roles to get back on track and now has grabbed the director reins with both hands.

""The Town"" is placed in and about my loved Boston. ""Ahh, ahh, Boston you're my home"". By choosing Charlestown (now a yuppier ""Chuckville"") as its base, the North End for a car chase and the bowels of old (1912) Fenway for the climactic ""last job"", he is at home in his surrounding. Anyone who has walked thru the North End, stopped for a ""slice"" and checked out the streets knows that's the last place you'd ever expect a high speed car chase. Ben's camera work and editing makes it a thrilling, crash filled event. Pity the poor stunt drivers who has to careen around those corners!

So, lots of reviews tell the plot points. I'm just writing to voice my opinion on the entertainment value and that is very high. Though its over two hours, it never drags. Ben gives each of his excellent cast a very strong scene or two. Chris Cooper gets 5 minutes of screen time and is excellent. Rebecca Hall, the prettiest average looking person you'll see, is terrific. Jeremy Renner is calm and explosive, at the same time. Jon Hamm gets to look cool, be cool and stay cool. He is a different FBI than we are used to. Smart, but with a meaner edge. And, for me, last but not least, Blake Lively. I hear she's a glamor girl on TV and red carpets, but here she absorbs the role of broken, damaged and desperate, with a glob of mascara in each eye. One review I read said ""she's no Amy Ryan"" (see:""Gone Baby Gone""). Maybe not, but that's pretty unfair and she is well up to the task here.

So, action, anti-heroes to ""root"" for and Fenway Park (a diamond on the outside, pretty scruffy underneath)!! What's not to like? But I've got to nit-pick one thing. Does everyone in the world have a 3 day beard??? FBI guys go to the office unshaven for days? Ben even has some uneven moments where he goes from 2 to 1 to 3 day beards in the same caper! Hey, what can you do, its not one big long shoot, but it was a lot of stubble!",8
25 December 2010,Great Crime Drama,"It's true Ben Affleck has been in some rather bad movies(cough ""Reindeer Games"") but really his record is definitely over .500 from ""Good Will Hunting"" to ""The Sum of All Fears"" and the underrated ""Changing Lanes"". He's been the butt of a lot of jokes but when it comes to his directorial debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" and this one ""The Town"" no ones laughing. The one thing that shocked me was the real suspense I felt during the movie. One thing directors are doing now that is ruining this is making the audience omniscient. Giving us all the views so we know whats coming around every corner. Here we're left in the dark to guess what's going on just as the characters are wondering what's going on.

A movie like this rely's heavily on the actors and some you'll recognize from ""Gone Baby Gone"". Jeremy Renner who most of you will remember from last year's ""Hurt Locker"" however is your looking for a reprise of that role stop and look for something else. Here he's playing a thug and thief and he does it masterfully. The rest of MacRay's crew is effective in there roles from Slaine as the driver to Blake Lively as Coughlin's drugged out sister with a daughter and no idea who the father is. Also Jon Hamm as the F.B.I. agent Frawley is good even though he seems like the villain in all this you have to remember the heroes of this movie are criminals, that is all I'll say on that subject.

One side note that I've been finding more and more interesting lately is that when people walk out a theatre playing a movie like this there is always one or two people saying ""they didn't need all that bad language"" my first thought is, well when your in a shoot out or running from the cops your not thinking ""oh shoot I really hope I get away"". So be warned if language or violence offends you stay clear of this one or really any crime movie of this sort.

If your still reading then this is your sort of movie and you will not be disappointed I enjoyed every minute of it and was actually on the edge of my seat for part of it. I try to while until I write a review on any movie so I'm not still in awe of the initial viewing. So as I have viewed ""The Town"" again I'm reminded how much I was enjoyed this movie and how it will probably rank up with the greats like ""Heat"".

I'm actually excited to see what Ben Affleck does next, whereas some could argue ""Gone Baby Gone"" was a fluke, I can't see anyone saying it now after this one.",10

21 November 2020,A solid crime-thriller film,"From the moment I'm watching ""The Town"", I thought this film is based on a true event because of the impression it gave. This film is based on 2004 novel by Chuck Hogan entitled ""Prince of Thieves"". The film already delivered a weighty and convincing plot since the start of the movie and maintained it until the end of the film through a good direction of Ben Affleck. The crime-thriller vibe is pretty engaging throughout the film thanks to the good execution of action sequences, Charlestown representation, investigative scenes, and love story - which became an important element to support the plot. Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively, and Jeremy Renner each carried out an outstanding performances. Overall, ""The Town"" secured a spot to one of the best crime thriller film of the 21st Century.

30 April 2011,"Well, give Affleck some points for trying.","Quite simply, this was almost a great movie. It had a lot of potential. Not to say that The Town is a bad movie necessarily--it just doesn't live up to its hype.

It wasn't all terrible. The acting was superb, with the performances verging on brilliant. Renner really deserved his Oscar nomination. All of the characters were truly believable. Also, the cinematography was excellent. Visually, it was impressive.

Unfortunately, the murky plot line that stole ideas from every other bank heist movie known to man made it nearly impossible to fully appreciate the characters. Not to mention that this movie was way, way too long, which didn't help me follow the plot at all. (I started getting bored enough to tally the f-bombs. There were over 200. I have no problem with profanity and I use it myself, but it's hard to take people seriously when they constantly use the f-word instead of adjectives and nouns) There was simply too much they were trying to fit into the movie. It seemed very ""busy."" They could have focused on one romantic relationship instead of the two and it would have been much easier to follow the heist part of the story.

On that note, I thought that Blake Lively's character (while surprisingly well-performed) was completely extraneous. Granted, she might have been really important and I missed it--but even then I could blame that on the length problem I mentioned earlier.

This was a movie I really, really, wanted to enjoy. It looked great and got rave reviews. But I couldn't help but feel disappointed by it. I didn't hate it, because I didn't really have a reason to. But I didn't love it either. I found it to be a mediocre, room-temperature drama that could have been amazing.",5

17 January 2011,Suspenseful and Exciting,"Ben Affleck directs his second film after Gone Baby Gone. The Town is a thriller surrounding a group of robbers, a bank teller, and the FBI agent out to capture the bank robbers. At a laundromat following the most recent bank robbery, Affleck's character falls in love with the employee who they took hostage, played by Rebecca Hall. His accomplice, played by Jeremy Renner, immediately lashes out at him. With his accomplices, former girlfriend (played by Blake Lively), and his disguised-as-florist boss all confronting him, he must make the decision to either leave with Hall or continue his life of crime. The first hour of this film is stunning and phenomenal. The characters pull you into their minds, and you feel as if you are one of the characters in each scene. Every member of the cast delivers a solid-to-exceptional performance. Affleck, Hall, Renner, and Lively are particularly breathtaking, but it's the third of the quartet who deserves an Oscar nomination. Renner infuses the viewer with fear, pity, and so many other emotions. However, the second half of the film feels less authentic. The plausibility of the film takes somewhat of a nose dive, with the story struggling to deliver more character nuances and plot development. As a result, the ending underwhelms especially in comparison to the rest of the film. For what it's worth, The Town is one of the best films of the year and the best thriller of 2010.",9
29 September 2010,"Ben Affleck is an incredible director, and I'm expecting a blizzard forecast from the bowels of Hell any day now..","The director is the most important single person in the production of a motion picture. Like on a football team, each player has a role, but the Quarterback is the difference maker. A director has to be exceptional at two things to master his craft, the first being that they must be able to overcome the limitations of the camera. By this I mean, most people think of the camera as a tool, the cinematographer would certainly say that it is – but to the actual story-teller (i.e. the director) the camera, and the limitations of its movement and the constraints of the frame, are an obstacle, one that must be traversed with deft skill to get the story across. The second element to master is what I call ""building a set,"" this is not to suggest actual physical set construction, but rather an atmosphere on location of the shoot that allows your actors to achieve their best work. This last element is very difficult. If you've ever been on a motion picture set, you know that literally everyone except the director and actors involved in that shot – from the camera operators, to the sound techs, to the grips and teamsters are all tapping their feet, impatiently waiting to go to the Kraft Table and get some food. It's amongst this atmosphere that a director must ask his actors to pretend they are someone else, somewhere else – with all the subtleties of 'reality' interjected – and make it completely believable. The director must make the actors feel no rush, no pressure, and to gently ease them into the skin of another person. Its even far more difficult than it sounds. Usually the best directors at this second trait are often former actors – for obvious reasons. Once you've worked in the craft, you respect the subtleties required to master it. Hollywood has a laundry list of Luke-warm actors who turned out to be excellent directors for this exact reason – both Richie Cunningham and Dirty Harry come to mind. Well, believe it or not, Ben Affleck now belongs on this list. And the two traits I mentioned above, he possesses in spades. I know, I know impossible to believe, right? Mikey's lost his mind, right? Go see 'The Town,' and tell me I'm wrong. The Town, co-written, co-produced, directed by and starring Ben Affleck is a by-the-numbers heist thriller, that has no real surprises or twists – and yet is exceptional for one reason = Affleck. Scenes where you know the outcome before it begins are still gripping because they are so well acted and shot. But Ben's not alone in his brilliance – almost every actor involved gives one the best performances of their careers including both Blake Lively and Jon Hamm (who jigs like Nero with his Fiddle while playing a wicked evil cop) and part of that must be attributed to Affleck's direction. And Chris Cooper has only one scene, but his gravity is so severe I felt myself being pulled into the center of the Earth by it. But the stand-out performance here belongs to Jeremy Renner who plays the type of friend you love because he's your ally, yet you'd fear and loath him if his loyalties lied elsewhere. A dragon of a friend, one who would eat you if he didn't love you. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a landmark film (like say Inception) or a possible Best Pic nod, in fact the film is very simple and straight forward. If you like action films with razors' edge dialogue and a healthy dose of moral ambiguity – you are going to love this film, but it ain't Citizen Kane. It didn't reinvent formula or advance the genre or anything like that, instead its proof that a well made film doesn't have to break convention or change the way scripts are written to be worth the price of admission. What I loved most about the picture was it had some of the best dialogue in a film since Tarantino convinced everyone with Pulp Fiction that campy, unbelievable dialogue is how people in action movies are supposed to talk. Instead the film portrays dangerous, uneducated, unpredictable people who talk like dangerous, uneducated, unpredictable people. It was so refreshing it felt like cool spring water from a hose in 110 degree weather. Furthermore, it convinced me that Affleck wrote more of Good Will Hunting's epic dialogue than I ever thought possible beforehand. Frankly, I thought Damon wrote that script while Ben smoked weed on the couch. The Town proved I was wrong, in fact some of the best dialogue in that film was Affleck's alone – cutting riffs and dry comebacks are Ben's literary specialty. So tomorrow you might look out the window and see a pig flying to work, or Dana Carvey might wake up with monkeys literally flying out of his butt, because Ben Affleck is a major directorial talent. Who knows maybe Carrot Top is waiting in the wing with a script that will become the next Rashomon, at this point I believe anything is possible... but I doubt it.",8
7 November 2010,Surely coming back to the town,"When I first saw the trailer it seemed like it was going to be pretty good movie. But this is not only good, this is an intense, dramatic and touching experience that surpassed my expectations by far. Ben Affleck used to be the pretty boy that started in popcorn movies such as Armaggedon and Pearl Harbor, but as a director he has shown tremendous talent. Of course the plot is not original but the performances of all the cast are terrific, action scenes reminded me the best moments of Heat and the way that the story is pulled together leaves you wanting more and most important you care about all the characters. There is no good or bad guys, simply very human people trapped in a concrete prison. This is for me one of the best films of 2010 and leaves me expecting anxiously the next Ben Affleck film as a director.

28 December 2021,Solid crime flick,"Great ensemble cast, realistic action, perfect setting - if you like cat & mouse crime stories, give it a watch. The only real beef I have with it is the depiction of anyone driving 80+mph anywhere in Boston. In broad daylight. Total fiction.

26 November 2020,Liked it but....,"....but I don't get the meh brigade who consistently cite 'worst this' 'worst that' as if there is some accepted and standard measure used to arrive at such a conclusion. Ok you didn't like it but chances are it ain't the worst ever so be a little more imaginative. And, if you're tempted to add the phrase 'that's 2 hours of my life I won't get back'.....please don't. Like you might have cured cancer or ended global warming as the alternative. No, more likely you would have stared at your phone or your Xbox...so please don't make out like it's a huge loss. Urging others not to 'waste their time' because you feel you have....im not interested. Have something useful to say or just shut up. Next time consider the 2 hours as an experience. If ain't enjoyable why waste more time whining about it in print?

7 October 2010,myETVmedia recommends this thriller,"Ben Affleck is back behind the camera and has a starring role in his latest crime drama ""The Town"", set in Boston. ""The Town"" is based on the book by Chuck Hogan ""Prince of Thieves: A Novel"". Affleck (Doug) is a hardened criminal type who finds he is deeply conflicted when he falls in love with Claire (Rebbecca Hall) a victim of their latest bank robbery. Aspects of the movie are reminiscent of techniques used in ""The Departed"", Mann's ""Heat"" and ""The Dark Knight"".

""The Town"" showcases the neighbourhood of Charlestown, touted as one of the most crime infested places in the United States. Doug MacRay (Affleck) is part of a local gang that robs banks to survive. Something goes wrong on the gang's latest heist. The bank manager, Claire sees more then she should, forcing the gang to briefly take her hostage. Aware that the bank robbers know a lot about her Claire is unaware that Doug is one of them when she happens to meet him a few days later. The immediate chemical attraction between them leads to a passionate romance that will capitulate the couple into dangerous territory.

The strongest aspect of ""The Town"" is its stellar supporting cast which include: Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, Titus Welliver... read more @www.myetvmedia.com/film- review/the-town/",7
14 February 2021,Great all rounded Film,"This film has everything! Awesome action sequences, thrilling moments, a heist!, and really good character driven scenes and development; which are acted superbly. Jeremy Renner in particular was a standout; gelled nicely with Ben Affleck. It is well written; Ben Affleck acts and directs the film well. Enjoyed it very much.

14 May 2011,Ben Affleck and his crew do a standard bank job but don't realize until after its done that the bank manger can eyewitness one of his crew's members tattoos,"My movie going interest lead I to go see the town rated R. A very well done drama writing and directed by and starring Ben Affleck, Blake lively, and the reliable Jeremy Renner.

Ben Affleck went back to his home town of Boston to write, and direct this gritty drama about the city of Charlestown, where the local employment trade is bank robbery among its citizen's. Ben is the unofficial leader of a cast of characters lead by Jeremy Renner. Ben and Jeremy are best friends in this well written drama. A monkey wrench gets into the work when been falls in love with a female bank manger from bank they held up Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). She can identify a tattoo on the neck one of Ben's crew. What ensues is some very tense and well done acting involving Big Ben Blake lively,Jeremy Renner,and Jon Hamm as FBI agent Adam Frawley.

Some of the best scene are involving the car chases in the very narrow streets of Charlestown's, I'm still trying to figure out how they did some of those stunts... I love they how they used Fenway park as back drop for a fantastic shoot out scene. They did a admirable job using the town itself to get a real feel what it's like in the bank robbing capital of Boston.

I thought the combination of the cast back ground of the city, story line makes for a good time at the theaters. I give it 4 stars.

My blog is http://www.thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/",
20 September 2010,Almost really good,"Ben Affleck's sophomore attempt at directing is solid. The characters are examined and expanded upon from beginning to end giving the audience a reason to care for the outcome, unlike many action movies these days. but wait, is it an action movie? This question is pondered the entire film. Is it a drama or an action film? Many times these can never both be true, at least successfully. Affleck, who focused on the pure authenticity of Boston in ""Gone, Baby, Gone"", seemed to have been confused by this same question. For the first hour and a half the film is shot as a realistic, no bull crap story, not to the same extent as ""GBG"" but still. Yet as we reach the climax it completely switches gears leaving the audience puzzled and unsure.It loses all the this-is-really-happening emotions and instead strives for this-is-pretty-cool.

If Affleck, who also co-wrote it, had stuck with the this-is-really-happening feel, and lost all the poorly aimed gun battles then it'd be an 8. But despite the acting quality, especially of Jeremy Renner, and the sheer beauty of the direction, it is lost in the ongoing battle of action vs. drama.",7
29 June 2019,JUST AMAZING!,"Can't remember a good film about bank robbers other than this. Ben Affleck is really did a great job as a director and screenplay writer, not as much as actor. Sometime his dialogue delivery feels heartless, he just reads his lines loudly, major cons of this flick. But this doesn't takes u away from film's good parts. GOOD THINGS 1) THE CHARACTERS- They are interesting, Thanks to well written script, Jeremy runner shines, his performance is so much better than other actors, He really captures the essence of a Boston bank robber (his character). He is funny, smart, loves his family but with short temper ( typical ) . Blake lively looked so hot in this movie, she did a good job same as other actors. 2) DIRECTION- Affeck did a great job as a director. First bank robbery scene is really good. He really did a good job maintaining the flow of the movie , so it doesn't get boring. Romance or romantic scenes between Affleck & the girl is really well done, it really doesn't disturb the main plot . The ENDING is perfect to me . Ending wise it is better than heat imo. I watched this on Netflix, worth watching!

16 January 2018,"Great story, the police-related scenes a bit flawed.","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting.

23 September 2010,Ben Affleck is a God.,"The Man can make one hell of a movie! Ben Affleck seems to never disappoint, first he makes a spectacular movie called Gone baby Gone, then he makes The Town, which is also a brilliant movie, and he is smart enough to give himself the main role, which he played to perfection! Another great factor about the movie is Jeremy Renner, who just seems to be getting better and better as the movies keep on coming. He was truly wonderful in the Hurt Locker and in my opinion his role in this movie was even better. This actor as well as Ben Affleck have something that many actors do not have, true talent. Watching these two men in the movie was a real treat, it was believable and impressive acting. Overall the movie itself had a good plot, it was a great action movie that just kept on giving till the very end. It was without a doubt one of the best movies i've seen this year, it had it all. I recommend this movie to all genders, it was probably more of a guy movie but Ben Affleck's amazing body(sadly only seen for about 5 seconds) will keep the ladies happy the entire time. Go see it! It was Brilliant!

24 September 2010,Good ol' cops and robbers no-nonsense genre film,"A fast, post-HEAT genre vehicle that substitutes the glossy sea-view apartments and wide highways common to this sort of thriller with a more downbeat, old neighbourhood feel (bank robbing is a 'profession' passed down through generations), with narrow one-way streets that hinder any getaway truck and community buildings long in need of grants and refurbishment. If it's heart is in the right place – one can see its intentions firmly written on its sleeve – it settles too often on old-fashioned motion-turning: even the 'moral ambiguity' of the cops and robbers dynamic has point-of-view on its side, and Affleck is too keen on playing the good-guy villain. Scenes between him and Rebecca Hall are driven by shorthand superficiality: personal past parental problems stand in for genuine character depth; John Hamm seems to be on board only to test his big-screen potential. That said, it's an often involving entry into the heist genre that handles its material with much commitment and not much pretension.

10 November 2013,!,"Action in case this movie robs was interesting. The burglar has been committed without killing people, and taking a hostage, but this movie hero, Tag fall in love with A hostage's woman. The love of the prohibition of two persons was interesting.

However, I thought that the place which does not tell a woman about true character was pitiful because Tag is masked. I waited for when A woman gets to know that a criminal is Michae with a pounding heart. I thought that it understood in voice if he was me. However, if I was which is a hostage, I will not think as usual. And I fount persons cannot think and cannot do anything in polar.

I was surprised at a burglar family's teamwork, and the merit of performance. Although he did not want to become a burglar, I thought that they were so cool. I recognized that fail in love with someone.

30 January 2011,Awesome Film,"I don't know which actor commented that Ben Affleck was overlooked for an Academy Award nomination for The TOWN, but he was RIGHT! This movie was the BEST movie I have seen in a long time. It held my interest from start to finish--suspense, romance, danger-- my heart was pounding through most of it cheering on the bad guys, the robbers. I cried in the END. All great actors. Renner's performance was excellent right up to the end. The FBI leader was pretty good and easy on the eye. This movie was well directed and it's great that movies are being made in and around Boston. Ben Affleck is an all-around Awesome Guy--Way to go Ben!

7 February 2011,Watch-able,"I bought the DVD last night due to the previous rather highly praising reviews. However, I was disappointed.

It was kind of like HEAT, but better titled TEPID. Everything was OK, but that's it! It was just OK. Nothing special, nothing new. The acting OK, the direction OK, perhaps a little on the ""trying"" to be arty side. The production could have benefited from a little extra cash flow. It's not a bad film but I would describe it simply as ""Watch-able"", just don't get excited first. It does keep you on your chair, but in the hope that it picks up and gets better. Sorry to disagree with so many of you, I was looking forward to seeing terrific film and was surprised when it wasn't.

28 October 2014,A night on the town,"Dinner and a movie does not constitute a night out on the town for this film. This Town has something else in mind.

Taking place in the suburb of Charlestown near the city of Boston, four men participate in bank heists that ultimately force them to make devastating decisions.

Extremely intriguing, the balance between action and romance in the film is divided so perfectly that it leaves action haters wanting more action and romance haters wanting more love.

""I'm putting this whole town in my rear-view mirror;"" is the ultimate goal of Doug MacRay, the main character played by Ben Affleck. However, he learns that there are times when business is business, and you may not have another choice but to take care of it and let your desire go.

The movie encompasses a variety of costumes, each entertaining the idea that you never know who is robbing you. Whether deliberate or not, the final nun disguise worn in the crews final bank heist, carries a subliminal message about the church.

Exceeding expectations, The Town keeps you enthralled from beginning to end, holding juicy outcomes that you will have to witness for yourself.",7
18 September 2010,You get a Lil more than expected,"Saw this movie today it follows the normal heist movie formula well enough. didn't find it to be to long or find any really dry parts to it. there much to hold your interest in between the action scenes. The action scenes are very well done and its hard to spot a unrealistic moment during. i found myself really feeling drawn in the action scenes. there are points in the movie where you find yourself thinking the exact same thoughts as the guys in the movie. the acting is well done by all i liked blake's role she surprised me the most. but overall solid movie if you asked it like an updated shortened version of heat which is one of the best.

24 August 2014,excited,"I watched this movie because of Ben Affleck. I am really big fan of him.

The mind of characters, the car chases and the gun battles are enjoyable to see. They are reality and well done. I thought the production was too over but it was good to enjoy.

But I did not satisfy about its ending.

After I watched this movie, I thought I am happy to born in Japan. However, I Have to reconsider about ""peace"" at the same time. People must be different by the environment in which a person has grown up. Really difficult problem.

5 August 2011,Affleck's Heist,"What Ben Affleck accomplishes in ""The Town"" is to inject life into his prospects as a director -- and even more surprisingly -- as an actor. In the first endeavor, not much could be expected, his experience being non existent; in the second, his less than convincing body of work was his cross to bear. Surprising or not, Affleck pulls off with passion and dexterity his dual role as actor/director. This is good work. While I would have ended the film with his demise, it wouldn't be because of the Hollywood cliché that crime doesn't pay; I would like to think we have grown out of that Cinderella thought process by now.

I found myself wondering, near the end, if Affleck had contrived to let his hero move onto a new life. That he did so bent believability a bit, but what doesn't these days, the real world giving solid evidence at every turn?

What Affleck has done here is put together a film in a genre that has been particularly popular of late, and, in this opinion, finished ahead of the competition. I found this grittier and more provocative than ""The Departed"" and ""Mystic River."" Affleck in the company of the Scorseses and Eastwoods? Really? Yes, it says here.

The performances of Affleck's ensemble are excellent down the line. Rebecca Hall is appealing as the apple of Affleck's eye, in the role of an innocent bank manager whose life is bent out of shape by the heist. Blake Lively is profoundly effective as the whoring mother of Affleck's child, a woman whose dignity was robbed from the get-go. Jeremy Renner, whose forte seems to be that he will implode ala his ""Hurt Locker"" persona at any moment; Pete Posthelwaite, one of those magnets who electrifies in any scene; Jon Hamm, as a believable FBI straight shooter out to gun down his contemptible target, Affleck.

This is good stuff, and I must admit, that even though he's a Red Sox fan, Big Ben has homered here. If you know anything about Yankee fans, you know I'm biting the bullet, as it were, here.",
30 April 2020,An excellent directed film,"Ben Affleck's performance as Doug was really good but he also did an amazing job directing this film. This film is a different take about band robbers instead the film shows them as actual people and the struggles they have to go through in life; making them ordinary people on the inside it's just they choose the wrong paths in life. Jeremy Renner's performance as James Coughlin was amazing he showed he was willing to do anything to risk his life.

The Town is definietly worth a watch as it captures both the FBI and criminal's perspectives of the law. Cinematography was done really well in this film as well with some breath taking shots of the city.

3 October 2010,Utterly Brilliant,"While I enjoyed the creativity of 'Gone Baby Gone', I just felt that the movie was dragged, especially towards the end. With 'The Town', Ben Affleck highlights his superb directing skills in this riveting movie. He also did quite a good job in the lead role but Jeremy Renner was the star of the movie in my books. Jon Hamm did a quite believable job as the FBI dude and its good to see him take up roles that require more scenes as opposed to his previous movies. The entire cast was superb and I think Affleck did his homework well. The movie goes in-depth, making you actually feel that you are part of this experience; you feel what these characters feel and you ultimately empathize with them. The ending was awesome but I feel like I have seen it somewhere before. I really hope this garners Oscar recognition as it really is one of the best movies I have seen this year.

29 September 2010,"Excellent Story, great acting, worth seeing.","Mr.Affleck def. deserves kudos. My husband & I went to see it, honestly, to escape the heat. We wound up pleasantly surprised when we both liked it, tremendously, something that rarely occurs.

The acting was excellent. The story was well told and compelling. There were a few holes, but not nothing really horrid or enough to detract from the movie as a whole.

I was really looking forward to Wall Street, but as much as I thought Wall Street fell flat, The Town exceeded my expectations and made for a wonderful surprise, almost like a little hidden treasure.

There were some decent action scenes, but not that horrible bumpy camera work, that is suppose to be 'artistic', but frankly just give me a head ache.

27 September 2013,Best Crime Movie,"Dag, a member of a bank robbery group becomes familiar with one woman who works at a bank where his group attacked. As the relationship with her goes deeper, he wants to quit his life of crime and leave the town. But that can't be easy. He confronts his friends, former girlfriend, and boss . Furthermore, FBI run after them persistently.

Through this movie, for the first time ever, I watched a movie Ben Affleck directed. Before watching this, I don't like him because of his bad impression comes from Golden Raspberry Prize winner and affairs with Jennifer Lopez. However, now, I do respect him. I can't believe he directs so skillfully.

He's really good at filming people and catching the atmosphere of Boston. Even though this is the second directed movie, he is well aware of location and when to insert musics. This is brilliant.

There're many good points in this movie. The scenes of robbery has reality and are thrilling. The climax scene's gunfight is very powerful. It's suggestive of Michael Mann's Heat.

Not only as a crime suspense, but also as a love romance it serves. Dag really suffers. He loves the woman but his boss threatens to kill her if Dag doesn't continue robbery.  I'm fascinated by this psychological conflict.

All of the cast are marvelous. Especially, Jeremy Renner is outstanding. He's a bad guy but I can't dislike him. Besides, other supporting roles are impressive. Gloansy acted by Slain is not only a bad guy but a considerate man for friends like Dag.

Although some critics may say the last scene is not good, I'm very satisfied with it. It makes me moved and I could bask in the afterglow. This movie gives a question to us , ""Can people start all over again even though he commits a crime?"" There's an answer. You should know it through watching.

I'm afraid it may be spoiler, but a tangerine orange plays a great role. I think it's a great direction.

As a similar crime movie, there's one named Heat. I love it but The Town  surpasses it.

Always tense, always well-acted, and always making me glue to the screen. It builds up to a climax without slowing down. This is undeniably masterpiece.",10
20 October 2013,Ben Affleck and a good movie? Who knew...,"Apparently Ben Affleck does better when he writes, directs and stars in his own movies. The performances that he is able to illicit from the entire cast is stellar. The cast has great chemistry especially between Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner. This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over. The Town is reminiscent of The Departed and like The Departed there are some violent scenes that aren't for the squeamish, if you can tolerate moments of violence watch it. The movie stays as true to the book as best it can with the main difference being that the back stories have been dropped. To me, however, this did not detract from the movie.

23 September 2010,"Not ""Gone Baby Gone"".","I went into this movie with very high expectations and sadly they were not met. The movie was surely thrilling, entertaining, and even comedic at times, but Affleck advertised and picked the wrong details to accent throughout the movie. In commercials they portrayed Claire to be psychological torn because of the incident, which would have made a fantastic story to run with after the two of them got together. Or at least, that is how commercials portrayed, this is what I was hoping. Something deeper, something more than just the thrill of an action movie, something like Gone Baby Gone, which is Affleck's most recent notable work, in my opinion. But there was none, The Town was a simple bank robbery thriller with a shallow, not nearly elaborated enough love story and an empty psychological thriller pathway. If you want to see something suspenseful and entertaining, sure, go see The Town. If you were looking something for a little bit more than that, may want to wait for something else.

2 July 2023,Hardcore crime drama,"This movie probably marked the comeback of Ben Affleck as an actor after his shameful early 2000s and flops like Jersey Girl, Daredevil and Paycheck.

Also, this film became Mr. Affleck's second directorial project.

The city of Boston, the capital of Massachusetts located on the east coast of the United States, is infamous for the fact that its territory has always been under the influence of Irish mafiosi. And the crime situation in some city areas still leaves much to be desired.

According to the movie, which is based on the book Prince of Thieves, the city has the neighborhood of Charlestown - a home to the highest number of bank robbers who attack Boston banks on a regular basis.

Doug (Affleck) is one of these robbers. During a bank robbery, he and his accomplices take Claire (Rebecca Hall), the bank employee, hostage after blindfolding her. When the gang escapes danger, they let the girl go. But Doug is not sure whether Claire has seen nothing, so he begins to keep an eye on her to be the first one to know if she has. Soon, the couple start a relationship, but Doug's lifestyle, connections and friends don't let him go, so everyone who is dear to him is in danger.

Despite the romantic component, The Town is a hardcore crime drama with shootouts, robberies and fights. Two actors deserve special attention here: Jeremy Renner, who played Doug's thuggish childhood friend and received an Oscar nomination for this role, and Blake Lively, who, perhaps for the first time in her career, portrayed not a glamorous beauty but an unsophisticated simpleton.",8

25 December 2010,Pretty good job,"The film starts with a bank robbery. Classic. But already you appreciate the realism. Characters go fast, are professionals and are here to take the money, not to show off, they get nervous because someone alerted the police despite all the precautions they took. So comes the story that I don't intend to spoil, so I won't go further.

The film's story won't surprise you a lot anyway. As one of the criticizers say, it is a tentative of imitating ""Heat"" , ""Point Break"" and ""L.A. Takedown"". And this is absolutely right as the film clearly refers itself to ""Heat"" as one of the heros watches the film on TV :)

That said, this would be an error to reduce it to a bad mix-copy of those films. For me, this film achieves to take the value of them and render a pretty good job.

The film doesn't plunge into the easiness of ""grand spectacle"" with multi explosions, unrealistic stunt hot-pursuits or karate fights ... No, here, everything looks real. Even the photo shots of the city. The heros are not genius and just prepare their scores well.

This links the film directly to ""Heat"" . It doesn't reach the perfection of Mann's directoring in dialogs, musics and, how to say, the ""dark atmosphere"". But there are some really good inspired aspects of it. And in exchange we got some nice feelings of Boston and its atmosphere.

We also appreciate the way the film shows how the heros are bounded to their own destiny, even when they manage to take distance with it. Contrary to ""Heat"", it is even documenting here. We actually ""understand"" people's mind of Charlestown and their no-vision lifes.

The film ends on a good last scene. So, no deception.

Jeremy Renner is perfect here. Blake Lively really convincing.

Ben Affleck is OK but less convincing as a tight guy from Charlestown. But as a director, Ben Affleck does score this time.",8
27 November 2020,Fun Crime Drama,"Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston.

16 April 2022,Hopeless,"Extremely mediocre and cliche. It seems like anything in the film that had any originality or value was mashed into a flaky powder of an easily digestible Hollywood flick that contains characters we have already seen, plots we have already followed, and some of the most boring and excessively long action sequences I've ever seen. I'd rather rip my eyes out than watch this movie again. The Town legitimately made me depressed by perpetuating the notion that this is all cinema can achieve - a lukewarm melodrama force fed down our throats. Like I said, the plot, characters, and even the score imitate movies with real heart, making it not difficult, but at least somewhat murky to distinguish why a film like The Town is bad, and a film like Goodfellas is great. The important thing to note is that there is a definite distinction there, even if the line is blurry to you. So if your watching this movie in spite of this review (bad choice) and your wondering why you don't like it as much a film with the same plot and character, it's because it's not the real thing. That being said, the average person probably won't care or notice this because just like McDonald's chicken, it tastes so close to the real thing, it might as well be.",4
6 July 2020,A decent action thriller,"A good action thriller ,the relationship between Doug and his friend Coughlin was good.The FBI agent and Fergie had a punchable face which is good imo.The second heist and the car chase following it was so good.A very good movie for those who are looking for an action movie with a good story as well.

19 September 2010,"Felt it, no need to rate or vote on it!","Say what you want about Affleck, he creates great, genuine street movies! Through this movie I felt it as I was there, he even puts the little things in there, it caused me to turn to my friends at the movie and say, ""Remember my situation like that""! You feel it with them because you see it in the actors face, body movement, and there crews actions around them, and not many actors can give you that, unless your directed by someone who has away for them to give him that and put it on the camera. I can go on, but never do this and I will keep it short. Of course I loved, Good Will Hunting, he co wrote with Damon, and co-starred? There were plenty of movies in between, some good, and bad. Then, ""Gone Baby Gone"", I was impressed, and he directed it. He caught the large and small meanings of the street, the good, bad, and how it sucks you up, or makes you stronger. I thought the best from Affleck, and his buddy Damon was more enjoyable, and maybe it was the way Damon created himself with the characters in the move, or just his very unique swagger. But this movie is not about the rating, or stupid voting (voted 10 anyways), it actually caught you threw the movie, you were there, you know that feeling, and this is as real as it gets, and you are blown away. Affleck blew me away, and the direction talents are very original and real, you very rarely see anymore. I sometimes think I should put my life on a piece of paper, the streets of Providence are a little different, but there is no other director who would make it realer. So Mr. Ben Affleck, thank you for letting me spend that $10 twice already to see your creation, I will never think or say the negative things I thought in the past about you. you have created a film that really speaks to everyone in the streets, and teaches the streets to the silver spooners. I was born and raised in this type environment, and this is the Bible.",10
3 October 2010,The Town - F***ing Awesome,"Blake Lively did awesome, expanding her acting range and ability to take more serious roles. Jeremy Renner nailed his performance and makes the viewer completely buy his whole edgy unpredictable personality. Pete Postlewaite's performance adds some class and depth to the story. The action scenes are amazing, especially the big car chase scene. Overall a satisfying rise, climax, and gradual close of movie that was well paced and well directed by Ben Affleck. This movie has convinced me that he truly has skills with directing and just working on films in general.

Do not underestimate this film, there is true art hidden under all the box office buzz.

4 November 2010,"Thank you Ben Affleck, thank you...","A friend told me about this movie...well in fact we entered it on a hurry, and let me tell you this: this movie is a must see!

It's about a group of professional bank robbers who get the job done perfectly but one of their hits ended up taking a hostage, but seemingly Doug McRay(Affleck) has taken an interest in her, he wants out but his friend's won't take no as an answer.

The bank robbery scenes are perfectly done, it's like real action in front of you and the acting is really powerful, the action and the shooting scenes will get that Adrinalin rushing and the plot just keeps evolving and evolving until it reaches the finale.

It's a movie that you will feel satisfied after seeing it, actually i never mind seeing it again, highly recommendable.

11 December 2010,cheap copy of ''the heat'',"there are many dialogs that repeats itself monotonously. my wife fell asleep after an hour. i insisted with higher expectations. but it's an ordinary story with cliché acting patterns.today i hardly remember what the film was about and have no scenes in my memory i am surprised with the vote. but i think people love predictable and easy productions. +why did not the police follow the suspects after the briefing? +i have never seen bearded police officers before +you remember the scenes from 'Heat(1995)' and 'Leon,The Professional(1994) +you should not expect anything original from this movie +you will forget the film an hour after you watch it

29 April 2018,A cliffhanger,"Where should I start? This movie was beyond expectations in every aspect. It's about the story of 4 bank robbers who're astonishingly perfect in doing what they're supposed to, leaving nothing behind that could even give any iota of help to FBI in tracing them. The plot takes a twist when Ben Affleck falls for the assistant manager of the bank they recently robbed. They both start seeing each other and everything works smooth until Jeremy Renner, who also has done his role breathtakingly well adorns this film with his Oscar worthy acting, finds about it and a tussle develops between both the leads. Rebecca Hall is wonderful as Claire, it fells as if she is really feeling her character and delivers each dialogue with a command which is captivating. John Hamm and Blake Lively have done their part well enough as the FBI S.A. and a drugged out mother of Affleck's child. Another brilliant performance comes from Titus Welliver as Dino who apparently coaxes Affleck to against the grain in the later part of the movie. Although his screen time is short but he does impress in every second he occupies the screen. The film is evenly paced with a great screenplay. The chase scenes are a treat to watch. The dialogues are absolutely amazing. You'll miss out on something important if blink. Watch it for the performances and for the twists.",9

29 December 2010,Boston Loves Ben,"This was a good movie. I am not a big Ben fan but with each movie I watch him in, and with each movie he does, he grows. He clearly owns this movie. He's hunky and tough and gritty , yet vulnerable and that makes his character strong.

It has the feel of 'The Departed' and being from Boston myself, the accents were perfect. Ben of course worked in all the Boston hot spots and it worked in this movie.

I really did find myself in his corner despite the fact that he was technically a 'bad guy'.

Although Jon Hamm wasn't great in this , the rest of the supporting cast was; along with great location shots, great acting and a truly great story add up to another fabulous Boston flick.

Good job Ben! Now we need another with you and Matt!",7

This was better than Heat, Gone Baby Gone & The Departed. Everybody who bad mouthed Ben Affleck better sit the F down and write him an apology, because with films like ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Gone Baby Gone"" and now with ""The Town"", This young man truly has become Boston's Scorsese.

This IS the best film of the year!!!! It should win Best Writing, Best Supporting Actor (Jeremy Renner), Best Actor (Affleck), Best Director & Best Picture. If you haven't seen this movie, GO NOW. Stop reading this review and JUST GO!!!

29 December 2011,My Kind of Town,"Synopsis: After pulling his last heist, bank robber Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) seeks out hostage and potential witness Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). In finding out what she knows he unwittingly begins to fall for her which angers his partners in crime, specifically hothead James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) who thanks to Doug's former relationship with his sister Krista (Blake Lively), feels betrayed. Doug's problems begin to escalate as he attempts keep his identity a secret from Claire while dodging FBI Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and local mob boss ""Fergie"" (Pete Postlethwaile) who forces him to pull one last heist. Buzz: The ""Superman"" persona that Ben Affleck usually exudes in every role he plays is actually believable in the Boston setting he's obviously accustomed and comfortable with. Although Jon Hamm's FBI agent comes off as a pompous version of his ""Mad Men"" counterpart and Blake Lively is obviously miscast as former lover who judging from her age would have put Affleck in the can long ago for statutory rape. It is however Jeremy Renner that steals more than bank money as he walks away with every scene he's in. Unfortunately Rebecca Hall manages to get as lost in the shuffle as she did in Woody Allen's Vicky Christina Barcelona. Adding great support are Chris Cooper as Affleck's interred father and of course the very visual Postlethwaile, whose face can be found in the dictionary under ""Character Actor"". Verdict: Although Affleck and Renner's performances are enough to carry the day, it is the story that sells the movie. The twists, turns, double-crosses and downright action are all interwoven into a tight script also penned by Affleck. In addition, Affleck's direction behind the camera has some nice touches of creative expression and style that he obviously picked up after years of performing in front of it. In addition, the film's production values, which include car chases, explosions and various shots of Fenway Park during an actual Red Sox game will leave even non ""bean town"" fans impressed. The ending is somewhat predictable, yet satisfying and all in all, worth the wait. Did you know? Jeremy Renner decided to surround himself with actual convicted bank robbers in Charlestown for research reasons and to help him nail the accent.",9
23 February 2012,Ben Affleck is aims good with The Town,"I was amazed Ben Affleck directed the whole thing including writing. The outcome is absolutely great, simple as that. It has a very good plot which develops intensely and drags you into the story. It is not rushed and it gave me a sense of ""Heat"" (with Robert Deniro and Al Pacino), because the story is about bank robbers. Realistic action, cruel at times, all that is well contrasted by the tendency of the main characters - Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) and Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) to live a normal live.

This is the first movie when Ben Affleck is playing a very mature and serious star role, not his usual ""whining"" style. I really hope he will continue to make more movies.

Jeremy Renner has perfectly caught the ""bad boy"" aggressive and offensive attitude, and what's interesting is that at the beginning he is put in a negative light, while at the end you come to sympathize him.

Overall a 9 for The Town has well worth it and I definitely recommend it.

15 October 2010,The Town,"Background and insight: I wanted to see this film from the moment I watched the trailer. Now I've been watching films/movies for as long as I have any visual memories and I know how easy it can be to make a film look good in a trailer. But the trailer for the Town contained all the elements of a great film. This was the difficult 2nd film for Ben Affleck. Gone Baby Gone was received well on release although it did get caught up is a small amount of controversy because of the similarities in plot to the real world tragic disappearance of Madeleine McCann. It proved to be a solid film, well written, well cast and well directed by Affleck. Critics then as critics do, started to suggest it was a fluke. What did Affleck do? He upped the stakes. This time with a bigger budget, much more ambitious plot and cast himself in the leading role. Not only that, but the trailer suggested action sequences to rival one of cinema's finest heist movies, Heat. Affleck stars, directs and co-writes the film which this time is a big studio film with a modest budget of $37 million, of which from the film I watch, you get to see every cent on the screen.

Rest of review here: http://seanryantownreview.blogspot.com/2010/10/town-movie-review.html",9
1 November 2010,Worth the money,"I enjoyed this movie, one of the best I have seen at the actual cinema since Inception. The story line is simple and easy to follow, a quick read of the description on this site or have a look at the trailer is pretty much all you need to understand the plot. I was a little skeptical of a Ben Affleck directed film, although admittedly this was the first film I have seen which he has directed. I thought it was very well made, the dialogue was excellent and no scene played on to long. The acting was almost flawless, Ben Affleck, being from Boston was obviously a big factor in this. I think one of the most notable performances goes to Chris Cooper, Doug's (Ben Affleck) father. Only in one scene, he added to the tension brilliantly and gave the film an edge. All in all, good film, worth the money, honestly can't say anything bad about it, only thing I would have changed would be to have had the film end in the florist, but you will have to watch to see what I mean!

5 June 2011,Boston's Finest,"I can take or leave Big Ben as an actor, at times. Sometimes I believe him and sometimes I feel like he's a little inhibited in his work and he starts to act. But as a director, I think he has some great potential. And acting-wise, this is one of the movies he nails. Yes, perhaps he was playing a guy from Boston and all that, but there were things going around him that were not just a guy playing a guy from where he's from. People need to understand this. He's directing a movie and he's acting in it like many greats have done, such as the masters Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson (despite any personal viewsand who gives a sh*t about thatleave the dude alone already). Not saying Ben is on the same level of these guys, but he has some years to get there. So, my hat's off to Mr. Affleck and his directing AND acting work in The Town. If I was his personal entertainment agent, I would take my time and focus on his strong points, and pick what he can do really well. He should do a couple of really strong acting roles next, get the respect level up to where it needs to be, and then direct (and if the role is right, act) another movie he understands the backdrop that the story stems from. Two thumbs up Ben, you've done well.",9
23 September 2010,Something to be desired...,"Having seen the IMDb rating and reading reviews likening The Town to ""Heat meets The Departed"", I must say I was sorely disappointed after viewing this film. That is not to say, of course, that The Town is a horrible film. I was a sobbing mess after seeing Inception. The thing is that while films these days are dashingly mediocre at best - that is - not too sore on the eyes but always leaving something to be desired, they are chopped up to be too much too fast. How long did they preview this film before it dropped? How much hype did it receive? More often these days than not, the answers to those questions are a lot more than the overall satisfaction the film itself delivers. We'll see what value these films hold in time, but me not being here to criticize the movie industry as a whole – let's get right down to it.

The Town is a movie more based on story than anything. There are really no quirky one-liners (save the usual crap talking and drug/sex references). No outrageous car scenes (those that do occur are mild). No dainty, prolonged sex scenes. Although, having said that, The Town isn't really a thinking man's movie either. While the story is what the film's strong point is: the brutal honesty is there isn't much there. But then again, as my girlfriend who I saw the film with tonight pointed out, maybe that's what's great about it. It's clean and good, quick and simple. Fair enough, but then, this isn't what this is about, is it? It's about being tricked into believing Mr. Affleck has made the next catholic classic. Jeremy Renner toting a Tec-Nine and bursting it randomly in his coke-head characters quirky fashion easily has to be the best part of this movie, and I CAN'T STAND Renner. Anyway, nothing about the plot differs much from ""Set It Off meets any-run-of-the-mill-girl-gets-with-her-hostage-taker"" flicks out there. The real evidence in this is that Casey Affleck chose not to appear in the movie. That's what I asked myself before, and answered shortly after watching this film. Would Michael Mann's brother miss out on a pivotal role in a movie such as Heat to follow Joaquin Phoenix around? I think not.

**Also, the flashback scenes didn't really affect the movie and were thrown in at the oddest, most redundant of times. I only say this because they added no real knowledge or meaning to what was already known.",6
23 September 2010,They say don't go into business with friends.,"I don't think this is the crime film it would like to think it is. I gave this movie a 7 on the grounds of it being an action movie. One more sensical than The A Team, Takers, or the like.

I don't think it functions as an effective crime/drama/thriller, because the aspects of criminality are laughable. Either that, or the intent of this film was to portray a bunch of idiots with automatic weapons brutishly ransacking rent-a-cops and incompetently prepared banks. If the latter was the intent, it'd still commit to being over-wrought and sensationalized (the blueprinting voice-overs detailing the guards, the elaborate cosplay, etc.).

People on these boards have pointed out the lack of foundation in the characters; Hamm as a thin hellbent 'detective,' any relational chemistry between Lively and Renner in regards to Affleck. Or even the flame between Lively and Affleck shoddily shoved in to facilitate the plot. But my main concern regarding Affleck and Renner's characters are that they seem to both be very unintelligible.

Renner is crazy--impulsive, like Waingro in Heat, sit his ass in time out, or tell him to cut that sh!t out. And Doug (Affleck), is a moron, willfully compromising his team. So he loves her? Grow up. You don't always live happily ever after. Maybe you shouldn't sometimes. Not that the film made it tangible past words anyhow. If these guys love each other so much, act professional for their own sakes.

I hope there is a director's cut out there so I can make more substantial sense of these inferences. Maybe some transitioning scenes to establish plot elements better.

Thanks for reading.",7

8 September 2011,Affleck gets the ''heat'',"First off, before I saw this I expected it to be a big joke being directed by Ben Affleck. I was DEAD WRONG this film is brilliant and its up there alongside Michael Mann's Heat.

The performances are excellent and Oscar worth especially from Affleck, Lively, Renner and the late Pete Postlethwaite. It's a surprise it got only one Oscar nomination because its the best film of 2010, its far better than the overrated King's Speech.

It owes a lot to Heat and Dog Day Afternoon as a bank heist film and has a very similar storyline to Heat. Think what you'll like about Ben Affleck like him or hate him, he's the next Clint Eastwood.

24 December 2010,Good 2010 action/heist movie,"A well done action heist film. Kind of reminded me of Heat though is not of the same caliber or as ""deep"" (if my memory serves me well).

Renner is scary in his role. One of those performances that gets you tense for what he might do at any moment. Affleck plays a very stoic criminal mind. I got a kick out of the business place of the ""boss"".

If you want to see a movie with complex heists, and typical but good tough guy performances this should do well for you. Not the most original but entertaining and well done. How many movies really are original? Very few. The differences are in the little pockets within the movie where they do things you've seen before but you still enjoy watching how they get there.

Definitely renews my interest in Ben Affleck outside of comedy. I just remembered he did Gone Baby Gone. That was impressive too. Maybe I need to catch up...

I finished it, but I want super attached to the screen or anything. The ending was good though, I liked it. I think Ben Affleck did a great job, seeing as how he acted in it and directed it. His acting was great, played the part well. Plus he's a cutie. I'm the beginning I was planning on giving it a 7 because of how much I enjoyed it, but like I said, around an hour or so before the ending it lost me unfortunately.

6 October 2010,Badass Town,"I didn't know Ben had it in him, but I have found a whole new respect for him in this film. He not only delivered as a lead, but somehow directed a film which really broke out of the usual mode I think we've seen from him.

The town most definitely kept me very compelled and on the edge of my seat, and I thought that the acting was spot-on. There were,of course, a few minor points that I felt were a tad forced story-wise,but other than that, it was a solid picture throughout.

The action sequences were really intense and had me twisting. The character portrayals were real and gritty. The editing and sound design were up to par, as was the cinematography.

I'm glad I went to see this at the theatre. Definitely the best I've seen so far this year. Very riveting, visually done well, and a great overall theatrical experience.",9
24 September 2010,'see you again...on this side or the other' - Superb film!,"Just got back from seeing this film today and got to say it is one of the best films I have seen in along time. It had everything, heist, action, police chases, sex, romance! From the very start you are gripped and you know you are going to be in for an edge of your seat type film and it doesn't disappoint. There are no lows and you are kept interested all the way through.

The relationship between affleck and the bank manager is very real and you are watching through your hands hoping that he gets away so they can someday be together.

The actors are all very talented as is the writing and the directorial side of it from Ben Affleck.

Well worth seeing and I would actually go see it again I loved it that much, which I never normally say after I've been to the cinema to see a film.",10
24 May 2011,Starring Ben Affleck along side a colourful array of actors; a couple of bank robbers from the projects hitting heists all over town.,"The one thing that this film has going for it is a kind of realism that bypasses the typical glamour usually attributed to stories of this kind. That is not to say it's a bad script with nothing more to recommend it. Not a bad script at all. But not particularly stunning either.

The entire concept (which dominates the plot) is of a couple of amateur but undoubtedly talented bank robbers who go around breaking banks around the city (Boston, Charlestown). Admittedly far from an original concept, as they've been many similar plots throughout movie history.

However, what sets this concept a little apart boils down to characterization, setting and circumstances. That quality which I stated earlier provides something praiseworthy.

Unlike most bank-robber flicks, The Town has no suave, impeccable, super slick big city rebels putting the ""cool"" in clever robbery. Rather, the leading/supporting roles here present the reality of the bitter disenfranchised, downtrodden by economic hardship who either striking back in protest of the general unfairness of life or simply adhere to the low expectations given them by birthright as natives of the projects of Charlestown.

Yet in spite of steering away from the stereotypical, there remains that quality about the movie that fails to set it above mediocrity, something not helped at all by certain discrepancies of script that detract from what is a clear attempt at circumventing the ""commercial"" arena into the possibly literary. And that basically means, it's a film that tries to be ""literary"" but misses the mark by painfully mere inches because of key plot factors that are a little absurd.

There are two of them, these little unrealistic key plot factors, and for the sake of not being a total spoil sport, I will mention only one: The developing connection between Doug (Ben Affleck) and Claire (Rebecca Hall). This comes about in a way that is outright absurd, to be a harsh but factual critic.

Claire is forced face to the floor in a bank robbery stick up; watches a man bludgeoned to death by one of the robbers, and is taken hostage after sounding the alarm, to be ditched by the edge of the ocean with a blindfold, and, this same Claire – after such a horrendous ordeal in which she glimpsed none of the men who'd carried out the attack because of the frightful masks they had on – this same Claire meets a random guy at a laundry mart – she doesn't know him from Adam; she should be at least a little on guarded/hesitant in meeting random guys who could easily be the still at large bank robbers that traumatised her, but, oh no, this Claire immediately attaches herself to this random guy, spilling every little detail about herself, including how she's working with the FBI on the robbery case! Absurd? I'll say.

And in the end it gets even more incongruous – something I'm not even going to get into.

So, my final statement is this: well-made + well-executed (by fair characterisation and good acting) + an alright script = promising, but not a must see.",
21 October 2010,"A gritty American film for international, mature people","I had been waiting for a movie that would gave me the same feeling of the good old ""US of A"" that the original ""Taking of Pelham 123"" did back in the seventies, and when I saw the shorts for this film, I was pretty sure that this was it. . . I wasn't disappointed. There are so many movies that bore the older person (50ish) who actually watches a lot of movies these days, from Hollywood (or the USA). E.g. the 2009 version of ""taking of Pelham 123""; I just couldn't stomach going to see it. It would make me feel sick to see such an original film; so gritty American - no pretense to know the rest of the world, redone in ""Hollywood"". Without telling you any spoiler, or anything that adds to what is already known from the short or the synopsis; this film, while I rate it 8/10 (the averaged estimate is perfect), I would for instance rate a new Harry Potter film, or Avatar at about 6 or maybe 7 /10. So this gives you some idea of how 'suited to the mature, international person' (I'm Australian), that wants to see a well made, unpretentious American film, likes this type of film. The Boston accent is so good an Australian actually can't walk away not speaking partly in Boston accent. The scenes and filmography are cleverly done so as to also be unpretentious - just raw Boston (I imagine). The story is smart enough to leave plenty of questionings at the end, while still creating its own clichés that help the watcher understand themes, feelings, and results. All actors performed well. Mature people are able to ignore bad past media (press), and know when they are seeing good actors, and all were excellently cast, and did their jobs incredibly believably in this film. Remmer was great as the 2nd 'lead' - Hamm fantastic as the hard cop with conscience, Hall also great as a wholesome bank clerk. I just could not take my eyes off her lips - the shape of her lips and the accent (she as others) had, were engrossing. Affleck - totally believable in his part and his making of this film shows great depth and maturity of understanding the movie business. He's not lightweight in his films, like so many coming out of USA these days. If you are a mature person, with intelligence, who knows the world a bit, and can take USA as it is, you will *certainly* enjoy this film.",8
8 April 2019,Love action flicks,"I really love this one I highly recommend it. Ben Affleck really has grown into an awesome lead actor and producer and director. I'm sure anybody that watches this and loves action flicks as much as I do will enjoy it.

14 January 2011,This is one heck of a great movie!!,"Everything about this movie was fantastic but I have to give the most credit to Ben Affleck - best acting yet and one heck of a directing job!! I've been on the fence with you Ben and honestly gave Matt Damon most of the credit for Good Will Hunting's writing. I am sorry about that - this movie proved me wrong. I now give YOU most of the credit for Good Will Hunting!! ""The Town"" felt like I was watching one of Clint Eastwood's best directed masterpieces. Just a fantastic job Ben!! This movie has the perfect amount of action, suspense, drama, love, lust, grit, and it's very believable. It shows you everything about the tough streets of a corrupted city that you don't want to admit you know is real and never crosses the line into unbelievable. Everything from acting, directing, filming, and surround sound are perfect and pull you right in. I found myself leaning forward as if I was part of the action. I'll be watching it again. Rent this movie and enjoy!!

2 July 2020,"So Intense And Great, Yet So Very Underrated","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better. The only actor who looks out of place is Blake Lively. She just can't get rid of that Cali feel and her accent sounds terrible. Brit Rebecca Hall does a better job than her. The action is exciting. And the story is riveting. But it's the characters and the actors that are so engaging.",10
4 January 2012,Short of memorable,"Despite it's great reviews, Ben Affleck's The Town falls short of memorable. Affleck plays Doug McRay, a notorious bank robber from Charleston, Massachusuetts, who was forced into the business following the imprisonment of his father, also a noted bank robber. McRay grows up learning the ropes with his nominal brother James Coughlin, played by Jeremy Renner, a belligerent, unruly ex-con who has become completely hardened by his life of crime and his stint in prison. The film begins with an intense, chaotic opening scene. McRay and several accomplices run a heist on a bank, kidnap one of the bank tellers, Claire Keesey , played by Rebecca Hall, and release her later with the admonition to keep her mouth shut or they will find her and kill her. Coughlin, not entirely convinced that Keesey will cooperate, suggests to McRay that he follow her around to make sure she doesn't give incriminating information to the feds. Knowing Coughlin's whimsical nature, and believing that he will probably kill Keesey, McRay suggests that he watch her instead.

What unfolds from here is part love story, part crime-drama. While the scenes are full of action and violence, the storyline is predictable and one dimensional. Affleck's performance in his star role is good, but the film would benefit greatly from further character development to provide greater intellectual stimulation, or perhaps an interesting twist at he end. Overall, I am not a big fan of The Town, but I still have hope that Affleck's future films will get better as he continues to grow as a director.",6
1 November 2010,The Town,"Does people remember ""Heat, from Michael Mann"" 1995? This film seems a nice tribute but slighty different on the original screenplay as expected. This is his second feature film and I just point a film plane that did not seem well done when Claire is in the bathroom after FBI S.A. Adam show her the photo from Doug and he arrives There are also some scenes that could be better directed (my opinion) but overall good! The sound was great. The music had some details that also make me remember Elliot Goldenthal on Heat Nice actors performance as well and Rebecca Hall had some great moments! The director did a great job, it was a nice surprise this film by Ben Affleck. All my best wishes for next projects.

20 February 2011,"Anatomy of a bank robbery in the context of character relationships, Charlestown, and the inevitable love interest.","This movie was hyped quite a bit before I saw it. And a lot of it was deserved. However, I was somewhat disappointed. Despite the high action content, I found myself drowsy at times. Too much of the usual chaos of robberies gone awry in some way. I found myself confused about the relationships with the ""bad guys"" who forced Affleck's character to do another job. Perhaps that was because I had trouble staying awake...which I don't necessarily blame on the movie. The acting was good, and I did admire Affleck's understatedness. Rebecca Hall did a good job as the bank manager. In fact, the trailer led me to believe (and hope) that more of the story would involve those two characters and the relationship twists inherent in their story. I think that was my biggest disappointment. Too much of the inevitable shoot-'em-up, the predictable FBI involvement. Too many innocents killed without any real character remorse -- which I would have hoped for given the depth of the characters portrayed. This movie obviously succeeded without my approval. I just didn't think it deserved all the praise it garnered.",5

Ben Affleck isn't one of my favorite actors but he fit the role well and is one hell of a director he hasn't had a solid track record but this is definitely one of his better pieces of work. the movie seemed realistic and somewhat relatable(well minus the criminal side). i liked the movie so much that i am going to read the book it is based on/influenced by.

27 March 2011,Ben Affleck Scores a Slam Dunk!,"I see Ben Affleck in a whole new light after watching this movie. Up until now, I regarded 'Heat' as the best heist movie. This overtakes that movie as the best I've seen. Great performances, great directing, great cast, I was really on the edge of my seat throughout this movie. This movie, just like 'Heat', is over 2 hours long, but never did I find myself thinking about the time. This was an honest and gutsy role by Ben Affleck. I hope we see a lot more directing from him. I honestly wasn't expecting too much when I bought this movie, how great it is to be surprised and bowled over with more than what you expected. This is what I love about movies, you never know what you are going to get, and when you get more than you bargained for, it's great! Great stuff Ben!

Affleck directs a gem,"For me this movie had everything I hoped it would have and more, I'm not usually a big Ben Affleck fan at all, but he actually produced a good character, with the exception of the changes his accent makes every scene. Jeremy Renner stole the show in my mind, his character was very well done, and he executed the role perfectly, really got into his character, great actor. Something else I really appreciated about this movie was the execution of the action scenes, the chase scenes in general. It seems like in Hollywood these days action seems are all way overdone, the town provided a perfect balance. Final verdict, very solid movie

15 November 2017,My Favorite Crime Drama of all time!,"This film has its Roots tied to the novel ""Prince of Thieves "", by Chuck Hogan. It's a crime drama that tells the story of a crime crew that's specialty is robbing banks. As with most Crime Drama's, there are cops chasing crooks and this film has a unique set of ""Crime Fighters""! As in the movies as well as real life, many criminals have had a sorted family life. In the case of this film the family business is ""Robbing Banks""! Starring Ben Affleck, the gangs leader as ""Doug MacRay"". His Evil, yet loyal Lieutenant Jeremy Renner ""Jen"", was nominated for the ""Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor"". There's a classic comparison of the ""Good Bad Guy"" & ""Bad Bad Guy, between Dougie & Jem throughout the film. Part of this comparison involves the love interest's, played by Rebecca Hall & Blake Lively. Throughout the film the characters are in two distinct categories, ""Lawful & Unlawful"". There isn't anyone in the gray area, even if they appear to be an upstanding citizen who runs the town ""Flower Shop"". In this case it's ""Pete Postlethwaite"" aka ""Fergie"" playing the ""Crime Boss"". The reason this film is so great is due to both the story & Excellent acting. Postiethwaite Performance is award worthy! Not to leave out our ""Crime Fighter"", (the less than respectful term for law enforcement used by the citizens in the town), is John Hamm aka ""Adam Frawley"" FBI Special Agent. Hamm plays the slick FBI Agent who has met his match with an even Slicker crew of bank robbers! In the end you will find yourself quietly rooting for the bad guys & not so much for the ""Bad Bad Guys"".",10

A lot of the stories and relationships are developed much better and clearer and many necessary scenes are extended so the actions of the characters make a lot more sense in the extended version. Not sure why they decided to take 26 minutes off the movie for theatres, maybe for commercial reasons to keep it under 2.5 hours.

I think they did the movie a disservice but at least they had the sense to release the extended version.

20 December 2010,Good Movie,"Critics have slammed Ben Affleck in recent times, but their criticism is sorely misplaced when it comes to Affleck's latest blockbuster - The Town. Fresh off the success of his last venture, he has starred in and directed a masterpiece.

The Town is the story of Charlestown. A low-income neighborhood in Boston. The people coming out of this blue-collar town have rap-sheets stretching way back. But these gangsters and bank robbers are as savvy as they are violent.

The Town is a great movie, but doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Not that it has to, by the way. It's a movie that casual movie goers will enjoy, especially with its traditional ending. However, it's ability to capture your attention (and emotions) from the intro of the film all the way to the end deserves to be acknowledged. It has pretty good dialogue between the characters, but it's the bold performances that will stand out. The Town is definitely worth visiting.",7
2 October 2010,Amazing Movie,"Personally, I have not normally liked Ben Affleck's acting, but his acting, directing, and writing here was nothing less than amazing. He perfectly played an integral role in The Town and it would not have been the same without him.

I went into the movie a bit skeptical, but still quite optimistic due to the positive reviews I had seen. And sure enough, it was a great movie. There are a lot of really great action scenes and the movie flows very well while keeping you literally on the edge of your seat.

In the reviews for The Town, Eminem's ""Not Afraid"" played in the background. If you go into the theater looking forward to seeing how they implement the song into the movie, you will be sadly disappointed as no part the song is not played whatsoever. However, the movie is definitely a must see and is definitely on my top five of this year.

29 December 2010,A great heist film,"I was impressed with this movie. It's different from most robbery movies...there's twists and turns that really make this movie unique. The movie leaves you anxiously wondering what's going to happen next. Especially you will question what's going to happen at the end. There's also more than just heisting to this movie; this film contains personal background of a robber's life. Ultimately, this robber recognizes this and attempts to make a change in his life. There is a battle in this movie for this robber to achieve this. Ben Affleck did a fantastic job directing and acting in this movie. Overall, a great film, definitely worth the purchase.

9 January 2011,A bank robber tries to change his ways and start anew.,"Overall The Town was an excellent movie. It was relatively fast paced (necessary for heist films) but still had a strong plot. The movie takes place in Charlestown, right outside of Boston, which is a place notorious for bank robbing. The main character Dough Macray (Ben Affleck) is a failed pro hockey player who returned home and entered the family business of bank robbing. During the first robbery they take the bank manager hostage with whom Doug later becomes romantically involved with. His relationship with Claire (Rebecca Hall), encourages him to leave Charlestown and change for the better. Unfortunately, the other characters do not take this very well; Especially James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), who is practically his brother. The rest of the movie deals with the difficulties and consequences of committing crimes and trying to escape from the criminal underworld of Charlestown.

The acting in this film is fairly strong because of its famous cast. Doug and Claire's relationship is somewhat strange. Whether this is due to Affleck and Hall's acting or it was intended the relationship was awkward. Affleck's acting is strong in the portrayal of a hardened criminal with a softer side. The fact that he directed the movie probably helped him because he was able to portray the character exactly the way that he wanted. Renner's acting as Doug's best friend Jim is excellent. His character is deranged and extremely violent and was able to play that role very well. His acting was arguably the best in the film. Jim's sister, Krista (Blake Lively), is Doug's trashy ex-girlfriend who claims that her child is his. This role for Lively is different from other role's that we've seen her play. Her character Krista and brother Jim create a good example of what Doug wants to leave behind. Finally, Jon Hamm played a determined FBI special agent named Adam Frawley. Although he is on the side of the law, the movie makes you dislike him for trying to make Doug pay for his actions. The Town is a must see for anyone who enjoys thrillers or organized crime movies.",9

This is a richly character driven crime thriller. Ben Affleck knows these characters well. And acting with the intense Jeremy Renner makes Affleck better.

18 September 2011,"A review of the movie, ""The Town.""","First off, the movie The Town, is about the town, Charlestown, and how there are more robberies and armored car thieves in this town than any other town in the world. There is a robbery that takes place in this film and a hostage is taken and released. The main characters in this film are Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), and Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). Claire Keesey is the woman that is takes as a hostage and then released. She is threatened by James Coughlin because she would be investigated. Doug MacRay becomes acquainted with her to find out if she is going to tell the FBI anything important. Doug MacRay eventually develops feelings for Claire. This creates conflict between him and James. Doug ends up going against James to protect Claire. Claire is unaware that Doug and James are the robbers until later in the movie. Until that part, Claire and Doug become close (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).

The theme of this film is about the town, Charlestown, and it being the town with more robberies and armored car thieves than anybody else in the world. The title of this film directly reflects the theme of this movie (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).

According to me, the main characters in the movie, The Town, are Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), and Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).

I have one example of a short plot point that is in reference to my thematic ideas. This example takes place when the FBI agents are describing how the four bank robbers are products of fathers that are criminals. Unfortunately, they followed in their fathers' footsteps. For example, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) is one of the main characters and he inherits his father's violence. His father was a murderer and he too tried to commit violent acts especially against Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). There is additional conflict between James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) and Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck). All three of these actors portrayed their characters in a great manner (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).

Furthermore, I want to discuss my reference to one other film with appropriateness to the theme that is for this movie, The Town. In my opinion, the movie Jumper is somewhat similar to this movie. This is because the boy in the movie, Jumper, is a struggling bank robber and haves a past that is similar to Doug MacRay in the film, The Town. In addition, the young boy is pursued by people who want to capture him. There is some romance that occurs in both movies and the ""girl"" in each movie remains safe because of the main character. These are the type of movies that lets the audience know that male main characters that are somewhat seen as a ""hero"" do have a good side, but there can be emergence of their bad sides (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).

Additionally, the director in the film, The Town, uses two techniques that I want to discuss. The first technique is the usage of motifs. For example, Ben Affleck uses motifs in this film. When the main characters are introduced in this film, they follow the same pattern of criminal activities that their fathers did. Furthermore, the image of the fighting Irish tattoo is used throughout this film. This image is very important. It is a part of the criminal profiling that goes on when it comes to the bank robbery. According to me, this tattoo is one of the main motifs in the film, The Town. Furthermore, the director uses different angles in this film to add to the suspense in the film. For instance, when the robbery is going on and the robber looks down to look at Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), this emphasizes the suspense and the acknowledgement of one of the main characters, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).

In conclusion, this movie does have romantic scenes, but the theme of the film, The Town, is mainly about robbery. There is somewhat of a bad guy gone good aspect in this film. This is the unexpected ""hero."" Over all, this movie was great and I definitely recommend those who enjoy movies that are about crime to watch this film (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).

8 April 2016,Simply terrific,"A story of people having no choices.No choice but to leave the town, put the past away, or even fall in love. Great piece of art. I've always wanted to join IMDb but I never did. This movie gives me the motivation. This is my first time writing a review, and I'm glad and honor it's The Town I'm writing about. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job, both acting and directing. Jeremy Renner is even more eye- catching. Every character was there for a reason.They all have depth and their back-stories are set perfectly well. Last but not least, those masks! Damn they are horrifying. I think I'll definitely see this film again(,this side or the other).

29 March 2018,Amazing entertainment - never gets boring!,"This movie had me on my toes from the first get-go. Superb chemistry between all actors, action packed but not over the top as many action movies can get. Intriguing crime with intriguing characters. I also find many of the characters to be very likable, it's not black and white who is a bad guy or good guy but rather a gray area that is more similar to real life.

A superb movie!
