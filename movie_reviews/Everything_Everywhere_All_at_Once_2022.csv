24 May 2022,Felt Like I Was Seeing the Inside of My Own Mind on Screen,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

2 May 2022,best film of 2022,"Profoundly deep, genuinely moving, utterly hilarious, highly imaginative and a visual feast. Haven't laughed this hard, cried this much or thought so deeply about any film in 2022 Much less all in the same viewing. This was indeed everything, everywhere all at once.

8 April 2022,"Don't do drugs, watch this instead.","If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.

20 April 2022,Fantastic,"""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""

If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.

Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.

The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.",10

25 March 2022,The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!,"Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.

And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? ü§£ü§£ü§£ This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!

Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.

This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.

EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.

Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.

There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!

If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.

Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!",9

26 March 2022,What a perfect title for this movie.,"It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.

Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.

Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.

Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.

Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.

The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.

It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)

The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!

I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.",9
3 April 2023,It Seemed Endless,"There's a point here where we are swept up in sensory overload, where so much stuff is thrown at us that we tune it out. I reached a point about two-thirds through this where I couldn't get my mind back in it. Have we reached a point where we have no expectations of a conclusion. When one has someone playing multiple characters in multiple settings, there needs to be something tying it together. The protagonist needs to be someone we identify with who has wishes and hopes that lead us on. She seemed as confused as the storyteller and the husband. I guess I'll read some more about this film and hope with guidance to try to figure it out a bit. Obviously, all these universes and all this actions (way too much battling in my estimation) are leading somewhere. I thought the film had ended about six times. I don't mind being brought back in, but I wish I understood where we just landed. Yes, there is a lot going on and it is violently splashed on the screen. But I ended up exhausted and unsatisfied.

1 April 2022,Near Flawless Film,"Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.

The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.

Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.

The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?

That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.

I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.

Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.

Thank you for this movie.",9
13 March 2023,Bit incredulous at the amount of Oscars....,"Firstly I should say I thought the actors did put in some very good performances and I can see why they were nominated although as to whether they deserved to beat some of their competitors is another matter.

I have to say I found this film to be tedious and almost unenjoyable to watch. It feels like a film made for the TikTok generation - no overall coherence with nuggets of scenes rammed together. Is this a film I would ever bother watching again - absolutely not.

Yes it is different - in much the same way The Artist was (and who talks about that film anymore?) but that doesn't make it good. It aims for a profound message whilst its style is overwhelmingly superficial. It's a film with little artistic merit or dare I say beauty (I am talking about the scenes and cinematography here not the actors) and it definitely did not move me except to pray it was going to finish.

In short it barely ticks the boxes of what I'd consider to be essential criteria for a great movie. Maybe this is the first of a new wave of this type of film and I am not getting it but when it had finished I felt pretty much nothing.",6
29 March 2022,Bonkers!,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as ""Daniels"", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.

Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.

That's just about the end of the ""normal"" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.

It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel""), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as ""Big Nose"", a regular customer at the laundromat.

As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!

Opens in select markets on March 25 and April 1, 2022 and nationwide on April 8, 2022.",8
23 May 2022,Way overhyped,"This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though.

23 June 2022,To Bagel Or Not To Bagel...,"It was my brother who recommended I watch this movie. He said it's crazy, but every time he thought to stop watching it, something else would happen to hold his attention. That wasn't quite my experience although I did stick with it to the end. I was also reminded of an almost identical experience some 20 years or so ago when a friend took me along with him to see a film he was raving about, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and that missed me by miles too when all that levitational martial-arts stuff started.

Well, I couldn't get into ""Crouching..."" and I'm afraid it was the same for the sensory overload that was ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"". Go with the flow, sit back and let it happen is probably the best way to approach it but in the end, it was all too much for me.

I sort of get the idea of multiple universes, where different versions of ourselves play out different destinies independent of what's actually happening to us in the here and now. Here though, the worlds are about to disastrously collide due to the emergence of an intergalactic super-criminal and it seems the first line of defence is Michelle Yeoh's unlikely middle-aged laundry owner Evelyn whose only concern when we first meet her is to get an almost unrecognisable Jamie-Lee Curtis's hulking auditor to sign off on the business's annual accounts and so keep her in business. Her dull husband then takes this moment to reveal that he's an alternative version of himself from what he calls the Alphaverse and that they are about to have the fight of their lives to try to thwart the approaching big bad super-villain whose identity I'll hold back from revealing.

And that's your condensed plot. There are lots of characters straddling the universes you'd barely noticed earlier who suddenly drop back in and out of what I'll loosely call the narrative. Just when you think you've got a reasonable grip of one plot strand, it completely unravels and takes you in another direction.

I certainly saw things I've never seen before or ever will again in a movie, including characters with hot-dog hands, a bagel as the centre of human knowledge, two inanimate rocks sharing a conversation and then there are the spoofs drawn from original features like ""2001"" and ""Ratatouille"" two films I didn't think I'd ever bracket in the same sentence.

I also found the several attempts at humour to often be way too crude and vulgar for my taste, especially when you get two of the villains looking to boost their powers by sticking a sharp object up their behinds or another baddie getting knocked about by a set of male genitalia.

Good luck to you if you managed to comprehend and actually enjoy this movie, but in the end I'm afraid it overpowered me into resistance. Maybe it was just some giant spoof of all those superhero blockbusters which have obsessed Hollywood for years. I don't know, but despite its successful box-office and the ratings here, I sort of wish that for two hours at least, I'd woken up in an alternative universe where I actually hadn't watched it at all.",3
25 June 2022,What was that?!?,"I don't mind weird films. Truly, I don't. But films that are pointlessly bizarre? Yeah, I'm not a fan of those. This is one such movie. I'd give it a pass if I were you.

9 April 2022,"With its strong storyline and amazing parallel universes, this sci fi movie sets a new bar for sci fi","Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline. Like Inception (2010), this is a breakthrough movie setting a higher bar of sci fi movies in the future.

9 April 2022,Most accurate title ever,"This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).

9 April 2022,The best movie of the 2020s so far,"Apparently the IMDb plot synopsis before this movie's trailer came out was ""a woman tries to do her taxes,"" and really, the plot's so creative and goes to so many unpredictable places that I don't think you should know much more than that going in. It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.

All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.

The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.

All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.

Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.

I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far. I hope it performs extremely well at the box office and gets awards recognition, because it deserves it.

Believe the hype.

Go in knowing as little as possible.

See this movie.",10
11 April 2022,I am a changed man,"Leaving the movie theatre, I can barely comprehend the thoughts swirling around in my head right now. From the intriguing trailer, you wouldn't even begin to fathom the existential depths this movie submerges you under. Only to bring you back to the surface gasping for air just when things are at their bleakest. The directorial choices are the sign of geniuses at work, the acting and cinematography and editing really show that mastery plus effort leaves the roof smashed off the place Everything Everywhere All At Once is perfection in all these regards.

You know it's special when you leave the movie feeling like it was made just for you. Daniels accomplished just that with this work of art coming to me right exactly when I needed it. The themes of family, fulfillment, love, and everything in between hit resoundingly close to home. I'm so glad I got to experience this even if it doesn't win any Oscars which it absolutely ought to. If critics don't carry this little picture on all their best of lists I don't know what to do. The picture itself, Michelle Yeoh in Actress, Stephanie Hsu in Supporting Actress, Ke Huy Quan in Supporting Actor, Original Screenplay, Directing, Editing, Costumes, Visual Effects, Score., Sound, Academy please consider Everything Everywhere All At Once. I know it's a challenge given the absurdity of some of the plot beats of the film but when you boil it down it's a very heartwarming and affecting piece of cinema.",10
9 July 2022,Too whacky and not very funny for my taste :-(,"I love many of these actors in the many roles I have seen them in, but this quirky, artsy, not very funny, hard-to-follow spectacle was not enjoyable at all for me :-( The artsy writer/director tries to mesh intellectual topics with quirky humor, and it just does not work for me! :-(

9 April 2022,That's what I call a movie,"Non stop action and laughs the whole way through. Everything Everywhere All At Once is the movie that you need to see if you want a great cinematic experience. In my opinion I think this is as good possible better than No Way Home. I loved the acting in this as well.

The way that the directors filmed this movie was also genius. The whole concept of the film was brilliant. Jamie Lee Curtis was also phenomenal as always. This film was just absolutely stunning to watch and to look at. Easily one of the best films of the year so far.

29 May 2022,Nothing Nowhere All at Once,"Did I watch a different movie? The entire beginning was a fast-paced convoluted mess of nonsense, that was also difficult to understand in between the fast subtitles and fast broken English. Sure, the story was unique, but all the attempt at humor was a fail, and thus made the story feel infantile. As for the acting, everyone was pretty much annoying except for Michelle Yeoh, of whom seemed to be the only one working her butt off. It's a very generous 6/10 from me.

10 April 2022,Good To See Miss Yeoh,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",8
12 June 2022,Aimless,"This film wasn't for me. Weird for the sake of being weird. What it attempted to do was something that can't be done. Similar to TENANT, it's a concept of the intangibles with the overall theme of love falling flat because there's simply too much going on.

Hence the name.

It's well acted, well produced with amazing choreography but as a movie its just odd. Original yes, but odd and hard to become attached.

22 January 2023,Overhyped and Overrated Bad Trip,"I watch and re-watch a lot of movies per year as a hobby (no money involved), and today I have 9988 reviews in IMDb. Last month, I received an email from IMDb listing ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" as one of the Top-10 movies of 2022. In IMDb, it is informed that this flick is nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards, 240 wins and 351 nominations. I can only understand that this is a heard behavior to the promotion of studio, using ""professional critics"" and press to promote such a garbage. I cannot envision a normal being, without financial interest or being manipulated by critics, to enjoy this crap. It seems to be a bad trip of the writers turned into a movie by insane productors. In the end, this film is 2h 19 min of complete waste of time. My vote is one (awful).

Title (Brazil): ""Tudo em Todo Lugar ao Mesmo Tempo"" (""Everything Everywhere All at Once"")

28 June 2022,Insufferable Intolerance All at Once,"A lousy movie. The underlying themes are the best there are but are used in a way that is nothing short of shameful. Two and a half hours of pure dementia, arrogance and useless effects without any substance. I wonder how this film can be considered as the best of the first half of 2022. A waste of time, health, expectations and enthusiasm. Garbage.

24 August 2022,SPüéØT-üéØN Magnificent.,"Michelle Yeoh and the rest of the cast and crew KNOCK this mind-bending, mile-a-minute, multi-universe film right out of the entirety of space and time, and take our minds, funny bones and our hearts along for the ride!!! In short, this film is ingenuously, honestly, chaotically, beautifully, disgustingly (in parts), quietly, reflectively, frantically, open-heartedly, MAGNIFICENT.

I giggled, laughed, snickered, cried (in both senses) and mostly, FELT.

It is one of the best films of our time, and I say this truly and with my heart on my sleeve: 1). If you have not seen it, don't waste another minute without seeing it. It is more than a film - it is an EXPERIENCE. 2). If you are someone who has seen it but were not quite transported through the exquisite subtleties or the outright power of this film, do YOURSELF a favor (I mean that) and watch it again - this time maybe with subtitles throughout the entire thing so as not to miss one iota of its utter brilliance. üíû",10
8 April 2022,Pinkies for peace,"If you get weirded out just stay through til the end. It's worth it I promise. Thanks everyone who helped this movie be made. In a time when there's so many remakes and more of the same this is a wonderful original movie. Enjoy it.

31 March 2022,Absolute Stunner of a Film - Sure to Be 2022's Best,"2022 is not even halfway over, but I saw Everything, Everywhere last night, and I simply cannot imagine it not being the best film of 2022.

To say I was stunned is an understatement. I am 37 years old and have been a movie buff since I was a child. Movies are my passion - classic cinema, international cinema, domestic cinema. I see at least 30+ movies in theaters every year from all counties and compile a top 10 list of my favorite films.

I can count on both hands the number of times I have sat in a movie theater slackjawed and stunned, unable to move as credits rolled on a film. I can count on one hand the number of times this has occurred to not only me but the audience with whom I've watched a movie. I have also only seen a few movies where the audience erupted in applause during the credits - rapturous, earnest, sustained cheering.

Last night's screening of Everything, Everywhere falls into the latter category. As credits rolled, no one moved in a sold-out IMAX theater. We all sat and stared at the screen in awe before eventually cheering and clapping.

This is a special movie, a miracle of a film, the type of lightning-in-a-bottle motion picture that comes along once in a blue moon to blow your mind and annihilate your heart with its boundless, bursting soul, energy, spirit, and creativity.

In all my movie-watching years, I have never seen anything like it. The closest comparison I can muster is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are many similarities between both films' unhinged, creative expression as well as their ultimate message of persistence and living life in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds and the inevitably that all things, both good and bad, will eventually come to a crashing end when the curtains on our lives close.

Michelle Yeoh is remarkable and delivers a knockout performance that will surely garner plenty of awards attention. It's hard to imagine many actresses who could have so effortlessly kept step with such a demanding role, but she coasts through drama, comedy, action, and sci-fi with a verve and energy that left me breathless. It's the fiercest performance I've seen from one of the best actresses of our time and one of the best performances I've seen in years.

As for the movie itself, really the less you know going in, the better. I saw the trailer two or three times prior to watching the film, and it did little to spoil the experience. I really do recommend going in blind, though.

I don't rate many movies a 10/10. I also rarely leave theaters feeling the way I felt last night: dizzy on the possibilities of cinema and lost in thought over all I had just experienced. Even as I write this, I cannot wait to see the movie again with new people so they can experience just how special this is.

Everything, Everywhere dazzles with its creative vision, but it marries the bizarre and magical with the mundane and the ordinary to make a statement about human potential and how often we let our daydreams - what could have been, should have been, will or won't be - roadblock who we are. The movie obliterates the veil of ordinary to reveal the extraordinary, but it never loses itself within its relentless, wacky, metaphysical vision.

Quite the contrary, really. When the dust settles by the end of the film, you feel like you have been taken somewhere new - to a place only the best films can take us - and are reminded that even though we might not matter in the grand scheme of the universe, there are kind things we can do - to one another and ourselves - to make the pain and joy of being human mean...something.

And at the end of the day, maybe that's everything.",10
26 April 2022,A lot to take in for the cerebral cortex,"Wild masterpiece that is a captivating deep adventure with so much all at once! Evelyn tries to file taxes then gets mixed into multiple universes of hundreds of events happening. This movie is metaphorical, realistic, bizarre numerous times, action greatness, family love, romance, comedy, ambiance some of the time, and some thrilling bits; Everything Everywhere All at Once has all the essentials for a magnificent experience! It's kinda like quantum physics adrenaline rush done very well.

20 March 2023,I don't get the hype,"I FINALLY sat down to finish watching this movie. I had started it when it first came out to stream and turned it off about 20 minutes in, I found it so boring.

But, last night I decided to sit down and finish watching it to see if it lived up to all of the hype and Oscar accolades...to me, it didn't.

Don't get me wrong, I do feel Mechelle Yeoh did a great job with this very complicated role, so perhaps she deserved it...but the rest of them, ehhhhhh maybe, maybe not so much.

This movie TOTALLY lost my husband, he just couldn't keep up with the different story-lines in different dimensions, and the fast-pace of jumping around from dimension to dimension often game me the ""what in the world is going on"" feeling. I get it....everything all at once, but sometimes way too much.

This movie, for me, didn't make sense at all until the last 20 minutes or so when, at that point finally, the writers basically spoon-fed the viewer the meaning of the movie, because (in my own personal opinion) even they knew people wouldn't get it on their own.

As for Jamie Lee Curtis, I also think she deserved her Oscar for this one. Hers was also a pretty complicated character in oh so many ways and a huge departure from many roles she has played.

So was this an Oscar worthy movie....eeeehhhh, not so much. Were there good performances? Yes. Was this an original movie? Yes, I can appreciate that too.

Was it over-hyped? Most definitely.",6
19 April 2022,Now this is what I like!,"This depiction of multiverses addresses the meaning of life and nihilism, with the protagonist having to be multiple versions of herself. A lot of it goes by so fast that it's hard to process, but it always manages to be funny. Michelle Yeoh does a perfect job in the lead role, with support from Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan (of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""The Goonies""), Jamie Lee Curtis, Jenny Slate and Harry Shum Jr. (of ""Glee"").

20 April 2022,One word: OVERRATED.,"Having seen countless raving reviews about this movie both on IMDb, and even more so on Twitter, I thought ""damn, I have to go see this ASAP"". I went in expecting something incredible, movie of the year standard, but wow was I disappointed.

Literally 75% of the movie is fight scenes, like okay it was cool at the start but 2 hours in and still?? 'Everything Everywhere' is perfect for people with a short attention span because there's always something ridiculous going on. I understood what they were trying to do with the plot but honestly nothing stuck, it just felt shallow.

Don't get me wrong it's not a bad film, but it's nowhere near these 10/10 reviews that's being advertised.

26 March 2022,Epic and Bizarre,"I dont often give a film 10 stars, but this was superb. It was an intense and bizarre ride, with the strange concepts stretching so far out there at times, it was as though they made more sense. It was visually stunning, the costumes were epic, and the balance of humor and emotion was perfect. LOVED IT. No one else was meant for this role other than Michelle Yeoh. She brought the lead to life in the most beautiful, meaningful, perfect way. This whole movie was mind blowing.

30 March 2023,Huge disappointment,"When I heard the buzz, saw the oscars etc., I expected this to be a great movie.

Wrong!!! It was simply a below average foreign movie, complete with subtitles. I managed, with much squirming, watch checking etc., to get through 45 minutes.

I guess its possible, the 2nd hour was equal to Shawshank or GWTW, but I doubt it. The acting was decent, but oscar worthy, not imho. I'm 76, and a movie-addict. So this movies rating, reviews were a real head scratcher. There have been foreign movies, I absolutely loved. But this one missed the mark, in so many ways. I will watch the second half, and if a miracle happens I will re-review.

For now 3/10.

30 April 2022,This is my early pick for best picture for 2022,"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows an Asian family that owns a struggling laundromat and is under the eye of the IRS. Meanwhile, the family is also struggling as the daughter wants nothing to do with them and the parents are considering a divorce. Further complicating matters the mother has been selected to save the galaxy against the ultimate evil that may destroy all existence as the family knows it...

This movie is codirected by Dan Kwan (Swiss Army Man) and Daniel Scheinert (The Death of Dick Long) and stars Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), Ke Huy Quan (Goonies), Stephanie Hsu (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China).

I loved everything about this movie. The cast was perfectly selected and everyone delivered their characters to perfection. The family dynamic is very well written and evolves well throughout the picture. The science fiction elements are clever but the fight scenes and choreography are even better. The depth of this movie is impressive and how all the intricacies evolve and come together is unbelievable.

This is my early pick for best picture for 2022. This is an absolute must see that I would strongly recommend and score a 9/10.",9
8 June 2022,imaginative and original,"Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh), her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), and her father Gong Gong (James Hong) are meeting IRS agent Deirdre Beaubeirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis) for an audit of their business. She is also struggling with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) coming out of the closet, a possible divorce, and a disapproving father.

This is imagination gone wild. The action is visually exuberant and shockingly comical. The sci-fi concepts are familiar and yet new. At its core, the story is personal and emotional. It's the same filmmaking team which brought us Swiss Army Man. Let's just say that they are unique in their cinematic visions and story ideas. At a certain point, the movie threatens to overload the audience with its imaginative visuals. That's when the story pulls back to the personal. It's definitely something different from the standard Hollywood fare.

26 January 2023,A Metaphor of Love for Ordinary Lives,"Anybody who thinks this film is about multiverses really misses the point. The multiverses are simply metaphors for the more ""successful"" or exciting lives that we sometimes dream that we might have had. To quote the summarising lines ""Here all we get are a few specks of time where any of this actually makes any sense"". The reply is ""Then I will cherish those few specks of time"". So the meaning of life isn't about success or glamour or achievement. As the film says in life ""Nothing matters"" (or nothing really matters - like Freddy said!). So life is about relationships and those few ""specks of time"" when we share with others the magic moments that make the.golden memories that define our lives. Just a few magic specks of time.

10 April 2022,A wild wacky action movie that has heart to it,"This might seem like a weird thing to start off with but, the editing in this movie was really well done. For a movie like this, the editing needs to be clean in order to properly follow the story and the editing team succeeded in this task. The use of parallel editing in this movie was cleverly done and worked flawlessly with the story especially when a match cut was also used. The story for this movie as well is a unique one that makes you think one thing but then becomes something else. The main story for this movie just seems like any other action/sci-fi movie with there being a chosen one who's the only one that can save the universe but underneath that is a deeper story. The deeper story is really what hooks the audience for this wild and wacky ride of a movie as it's one everybody can relate to. What I really liked about this story though was how it easily mashed everything together from the comedy to the more serious moments and the action scenes. Another thing about the writing for this movie is how something will be mentioned and just seem like a throwaway thing but then come back in some way. This is a testament to the writers and directors of this movie Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. This movie is a weird and wacky ride and the directing duo understood that and dived headfirst into it which is what makes this movie a unique and memorable one. What also helps in that department is the acting in this movie and man did everybody deliver for this movie. Everybody in this movie had to juggle between being serious and comedic and nailed it. Michelle Yeoh was the stand-out performance for me and I just want to know how she was able to stay in character during some of the scenes in this movie. The final thing I want to talk about with this movie is the lighting in this movie and how well it was used. The lighting in this movie, along with the screen ratio, helps the audience figure out which universe it is. In the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a wild and wacky ride that has a meaningful message along with it that you need to see.",10
13 March 2023,"Many good parts, not really good as a whole","A very ambiguous one. If we take any other aspect of it, it can be really good. The acting is great, the cinematography is cool, the editing is a masterpiece, the music is really good - but it was all put together in a very weird way.

Crazy stories are fun when everything is in the right order, when nothing is exaggerated, but you can't say that about this movie. It's like the creators took LSD or some funny shrooms and started tripping while someone else wrote down everything they said while they were tripping. It's sick. It's like that bagel with everything stuffed in it, both tasty and nasty. And it doesn't taste any good.

You can't unite the disparate in the hope that it can somehow make something good. No, it can't. I can understand an Oscar for Best Actress and Best Film Editing, but the rest of the statues should have gone to other people. I can't get this mindless awarding. And I'll never watch it again.

P. S. And no, it's not science fiction, even if they use smartphones and computers. Pure fantasy with delusional elements :)",6
18 April 2022,"Sliders, The Matrix, and Cloud Atlas in one mutation","Evelyn(Michelle Yeoh) a middle age woman who owns a laundry matt with her husband(Ke Huy Quan, The Goonies), and seems to be on the verge of a breakdown cause everything in her life is fallen apart, until her husband has a personality change when he claims to be from another universe, and tells her she is the key to saving the universe, and that is far is I go.

Michelle Yeoh is a very talented actress, and here she shows all of her talents at once and does it quite beautifully. Ke Huy Quan is also great, has it starts you begin to think it's Data from The Goonies(1985), but you'll stop thinking that has the movie goes on, cause he shows how versatile he is. It's not just a sci - fi action film, it has a lot of heart to it. Also has great effects also, and not mention a great supporting cast, namely James Hong, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Jenny Slate.

3 April 2022,"Goofy, Action Packed, Gorgeous and Deep. Daniels strike again","An instant classic, on par with the first Matrix film, EEAAO is a genre-bending masterpiece, equally parts funny, intense and emotional.

The basic plot follows Evelyn, a middle aged Chinese woman who develops the ability to share the skills and memories of alternate versions of herself across the multiverse in order to save it.

It is FAR deeper than that, and I wish I could go all spoilers, but I saw it early so I'll say this much, it is far more accessible than Swiss Army Man (which is still a great movie in my eyes) and I think many people will find much value in this film.

I will say that the audience I watched the movie with was the most excited and active audience I've watched a movie with since Spider-Man No Way Home. A completely original film with no nostalgia bait, getting several cheers, laughs and applauses. Not to mention the few times I got close to crying.

10/10 a must see.",10
12 June 2022,A novel idea...but just too messy and tonally dissonant for me to fully enjoy it,"""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" is a rollercoaster of glitter, color and chaotic multi-verse hopping nonsense. Beneath it all is a stretched story about a dysfunctional Asian family trying to muddle their way through life as they negotiate their relationships, heart-breaks and bitter disappointments.

While visually impressive, with a kinetic pacing and clever editing, I found it hard to be invested emotionally in the story. The absurdist slapstick humor is sporadically funny -hotdog-fingered apes reenacting the stick scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey made me snort- but more often it's just crude and stupid (yes, butt-plug fight scene, I'm looking at you). When it slips from Gen-Z 'Rick & Morty' style gags to tender family moments that are supposed to make us cry, these scenes don't really hold up. It's hard to feel moved by a mother embracing her wayward daughter when you've just watched a guy sumo squat on a dildo and dropkick someone through a door.

The script pokes at existential questions, but isn't really clever enough to come at them in a meaningful way; In fact, I don't think it's really interested in doing so. Much of the dialog is just exposition for the wacky dimension-hopping world rules, which you quickly realize don't make any sense. The sequences where characters are switching in and out of their parallel selves become so frantic, it's often hard to tell which version of a character you're looking at and what their motivation is. The writers can of course always keep leaning on the main point of the film that 'life doesn't make sense, so this doesn't need to either'. The ultimate effect on me was that, rather like our main character Evelyn, I just felt exhausted by it and rather lost.

I have to give a film kudos when it dares to try something new. There were some spectacular moments and genuine laughs, but it wasn't the masterpiece I'd hoped for.",6
22 December 2022,Disappointing: more style than substance,"Evelyn Wang and her husband Waymond run a laundry. Times are tough and they're in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. There's also some niggle with their daughter and her father is a constant source of belittlement and scorn. Now Waymond wants a divorce. Could things have turned out differently for Evelyn, maybe in a parallel universe?

The plot summary for this movie intrigued me immensely: the idea of exploring how things might work out if you'd plotted a different course or, more broadly, the idea of parallel realities. The actual product, however, is far less engaging or coherent.

The lack of engagement begins immediately. The Wangs' everyday life is a manic, unfocussed existence and just following this for the first 20 minutes or so was fairly annoying. It doesn't get any better once the multiverse concept is introduced, this just being an excuse for random detours and well-choreographed but meaningless action scenes.

It's like a typical pretentious concept-driven sci fi/fantasy movie: paper over the lack of plot with a concept and developments that are so radical and in-your-face that viewers are fooled into thinking there's something clever there, when there isn't. Then, to make it seem even more important, have the movie go for 140 minutes when 100 minutes would have been sufficient.

Every now and again there is a profound moment but due to the preceding scenes being all empty random action there's no context and the impact is diluted.

Disappointing.",4
28 March 2022,Stunning,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

19 May 2022,"It starts a little slow, but it's worth it","It was disappointing that my wife chose to stop watching it after 20 minutes, because the film was really good. It wasn't perfect, but it was executed well and the final return to the actual meaningful present gives one the feeling that everything everywhere at once can be OK. Not great, but also not bad.

At its core, the film tells you to not give up, that if nothing matters, then everything does. It is a movie for depressed reluctant cynics, which is what I probably am. It is fantasy, too, but only to make points that are relevant to real life. I guess it could have went really easily towards a Quantum Leap or Sliders kind of story, but ""the Daniels"" kept it fresh and tight and the acting was great.

I wonder if they started with ""We need an actor that can do everything and anything!"", so naturally they got Michelle Yeoh, then they made the story Chinese so it fit. I am sure in some universe that story is true :)

Bottom line: Most films have some qualities that makes them special, but very few are so considerate as this one. It's obvious that the authors gave it a lot of thought and love, which is rare. I guess that's also a message of the movie.",9
2 May 2022,Weight of Multiverse Talent,"I have not seen the Nicolas Cage movie yet - has not started in Germany. I think it has a June or July release date at the moment. But if one can talk of the Massive Talent Nicolas Cage posseses (rightfully so by the way), you can not forget about Michelle Yeoh. That woman is just incredible - anyone who has seen her 80s and 90s Martial arts movies from Hong Kong can attest to that. And hearing her behind the scenes stories a few weeks ago, made certain things even more incredible.

But I digress. It is not just her - we have the kid from the Indiana Jones movie. A sort of comeback thing, than Jamie Lee Curtis and so many other people involved. And of course you have the filmmakers who came up with the whole thing. Add to that a bit of Marvel flavor - at least in the producing chairs - with Joe Russo ... and you have a real pool of amazing talent working together here.

There are scenes here, that you might find woke, but it also has a lot of scenes that you might find disgusting. But as with Swiss Army Man behind the story, behind things that may be disgusting, there is so much heart. Yes seeing someone rip a (dirty of course) gum off a table and chew it was not something that made me feel good inside ... but those scenes work, because the movie itself works.

The frantic pace is just out of this world. No pun intended - especially considering how many worlds there might be. It is not entirely out of the realm of possibilities right? Who knows what me - or all the other me's are doing at the moment? Surely not all writing a review of a movie - but also hopefully not caring about the inconsistencies the movie has. If you break certain things down, they do not make much sense. But this is heart over mind - do not overthink it - let the movie and the experience take you on a journey and you will not regret it. It has some violent scenes and some other disturbing content (lesbian characters not being high on that list), but all that is packed neatly and in a way that works like a charm ... highly recommended.",10
31 March 2022,Stunning,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is stunning. It's a corky spectacle, but remains deeply vulnerable. The narrative follows Evelyn, whose business and personal relationships are failing. Plus, Evelyn is unexpectedly tasked with saving the entire multiverse as her personal life bursts. This story might sound familiar, but it develops into an unparalleled blend of comedy, action, adventure, and drama. Each role is compelling, the conflict is relatable, the arcs are earned, and the plot devices are utilized to their fullest. Furthermore, the entire cast displays a wide range of skills: switching characters, blending tones, and striking beats in a symphony of emotions.

Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once is masterfully crafted. Motion, lighting, colors, framing, and focus make every shot engaging and meaningful. The sound symbolically conveys psychology through silence, volume, and echoes. The multifaceted effects contribute to the ambitious atmosphere. Similarly, the production design is boundless, yet united by a lighthearted vision. Lastly, the editing is a powerhouse, jumping between several timelines, yet synergizing perfectly. Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is marvelous because it fuses so much into a cohesive experience. In other hands, it would be a mess, but Everything Everywhere All at Once works beautifully.

29 September 2022,Tries to be everything all at once and fails at most of it.,"To be honest I don't know what the hell I just watched. Bland family drama, comedy, action, science fiction, all haphazardly mashed together into a +2 hours senseless new-agey blob.

The family drama which runs at the core of the movie feels strangely forced, specially in the third act which drags on forever. Most jokes are genuinely funny at first, but some of them are dragged for way too long and stretched thin and a few others are bordering cringe territory. Spends an unnecessary amount of time explaining the multiverse concept that drives the comedic/action parts. Character development is basically absent.

On the bright side, action scenes are well choreographed and imaginative. If you want some wild, absurd, flashy action mixed with cheap tear-jerking, go see this.

26 March 2022,A beautifully unique exploration of nihilism,"Wow, what a movie. Being able to be so wacky yet so profound is difficult, but this movie is able to to do it all at once(no pun intended)! The main characters exploration of her relationships with her father, husband, and especially her daughter ground the movie, but it's willingness to turn the mundane what if scenarios that we make up in our heads into plot points is truly something special. While it drags on just a tad near the end, this movie is a must watch, and expect it to get some Oscar nods this coming year.

19 May 2022,Not as good as everyone is saying,"People are saying this is the most creative masterpiece ever, but I disagree. I think people are so used to garbage films of today that they don't remember what true creativity is. Most of the film is just random stuff like hotdog fingers and raccoon ratatouille, that's not creativity, that's just random stuff happening that only ordinary people would think is creative. Creativity is something truly new and outside of the box, like a sensation that nobody has ever felt before.

Second, the film's message and theme is very millennial (god millennials are the worst generation). The jist of it is how to live even though life has no meaning. It's an obvious, childish conundrum that most people get past when they're teenagers. But of course millennials are stuck in the past and don't know what a purpose-driven life is.

Finally, and I haven't heard anyone mention this, but the film is pitched to you as an epic sci-fi adventure but it actually feels very low budget. Most of the settings are ordinary places (like an office, laundromat, etc) and the weapons, even the futuristic multiverse-jumping gear, are just mundane cheap objects. It felt like those episodes of Community where they played paintball. The movie feels really cheap and thus the multiverse stuff feels like it's fake.

That being said, it's not a bad movie. It's just okay. It is certainly brave, unique, but it's really not creative, it's just random stuff happening, and the overall message is a dead end conundrum only for millennials to struggle with.",7
13 May 2022,"Unconventional, Creative, Imaginative, and Fun!","This is a very dense film, and I mean that in a good way. There is so much going on, but at the core are silliness and profundity. Trying to explain the concept or the plot would be a disservice to potential viewers.

But I will say that, for me, it feels like a cross between ""The Matrix"", ""Moulin Rouge"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and a Rorschach test. I suspect other viewers will perceive a diverse array of cinematic influences and be reminded of many other references.

One could watch this film many times and still be able to note new details. I marvel at how much work was involved, especially in editing.

18 March 2023,Not Worthy of Best Picture,"Because it had won best picture, I felt obligated to watch. The start of the movie, the scene in the apartment above the laundromat, was chaotic to the point of making me uneasy and anxious. About 40 minutes in, I literally wondered if viewers were supposed to be high to enjoy it. It didn't evoke any emotions in me, however, at times I did laugh - not with the movie, but at the movie.

Once I commit to watching a movie, I see it through to the end, hoping it will improve and I ultimately become invested in its resolution. But you know a movie is total trash when someone in this household says, ""let it play,"" before leaving the room. It was a colossal waste of time.

9 April 2022,LOOK ABSOLUTELY NUTS BE IS VERY VERY LOGICAL,"An Asian woman in a middle age crisis suddenly is informed that there is a MULTIVERSE and she is the only who can save from total distraction.

From there; everything is absolute madness, violence and many humorous situations for a trip of almost two and half hour.

No, is not SPIDERMAN and even the SCI-FI suddenly becomes more of a metaphor. It is never boring (perhaps a little too long) but everything that happens becomes absolutely logic by the end.

Michelle Yeoh is excellent and I hope she at least get a nomination. Jamie Lee Curtis also very good as always. The rest of the cast is on the same level.

9 April 2022,Maybe I'm a raccoon,"What a smooth synergy of sci-fi, action, comedy and some of the best editing I've seen in a long time. The psychological and story-telling elements are reminiscent of Terry Gilliam, but with a much bigger budget, and over-the-top comedic action reminiscent of Jackie Chan and Deadpool.

But to me it's the Oscar-worthy editing that really shines, so shiny that I'm dazzled enough to overlook what I'd consider the movies flaws: namely some pacing issues and the inability to give the film some real heart. (Let's be honest: sexual-orientation issues are passe at this juncture, and just come off as low-hanging fruit.) But the whole experience seeing this in a theater filled with riotous laughter was truly memorable.

My honest wish: that the fake ending was the real ending, followed by a ""To Be Continued."" I would have genuinely preferred this film to have been a two- or three-parter.",9

5 May 2022,"I don't get the hype, it really was just so so","Starting with what I did enjoy about this movie.

1. The setting of this movie was indeed a more accurate representation of an Asian American household. The family dynamics sounds about right. I like that Asians are getting more spotlight.

2. The concept/theme of this movie is rather novel and therefore interesting. Although I think it could have been played out much more sophisticatedly.

3. The parent-child relationship is well portrayed. The perceived lack of validation from parents felt by the child, the poorly communicated love of the parent, the process of gaining awareness and emotional growth for both the parent and child is inspiring.

Things I didn't like 1. It is a very bizarre movie, you could even say chaotic. It's as if they tried to combine every single meaningless detail together and gave up filtering out what's actually worth or necessary to the main plot. Tried too hard to make it funny/original/emotional/relatable that it ends up being neither of those things very well.

2. The movie is also unnecessarily long.

Those two points combined makes this movie just a long, confusing, and sometimes boring mess. The novelty makes it watchable/bearable, but to me, it's nothing more than that.",6
8 April 2022,The most original film in the last decade,"Whoa! This movie blew me away. I haven't seen a film this original in at least the past 5 years, and could possibly be the most original in the past decade. Brilliant film. Michelle Yeoh is phenomenal as is her supporting cast. She is going to be a frontrunner for Best Actress at every awards show for this coming year and she would deserve to win it. I can't quite put into words how well done this movie is, but it is magnificent. Easily won it's way into my top 10 best movies of all time list and top 5 most important movies of all time list. I refuse to put anything about the story in my review as I feel it's a movie that just needs to be experience. I laughed, I cried, I loved, this movie really does have it all. 5 out of 5, just freaking see this film! You will not be disappointed you did!

But for those that do know what this movie is about, where they draw their inspiration, you know this movie is awesome!

This movie has so much going on that its definitely worth watching more then once. Much like where it comes from, it takes time to unpack it. So expect to revisit this movie again if you plan to watch it the first time.

9 April 2022,Highly overrated. It's a solid 7/10,"This movie wasn't bad, but it's definitely not over a 7 rating. It has to have a good ending for me to rate it higher. I was hoping for a more complex ending with the story being so original, but it was just meh. Kinda ruins it. Story originality/acting is a 10, but the ending is a 1 for me.

It's a bit too long for me as well. Unless I missed a deeper meaning to it I won't be watching again. For me it was a goofy/original film with a simp ending. Some scenes were kinda cringe too, but that's what they were going for.

It's a must watch if your a Yeoh fan, she was amazing in this.

24 February 2023,Over-hyped and Just Plain Bad,"This movie gets tons of hype. I wonder why. I bet know why. That doesn't make it good. The film is just a mess.

A complete mess.

The storyline is idiotic and boring. The direction is completely and totally disjointed. It's nearly impossible to follow or even understand what's supposed to be going on.

I was bored out of my mind.

I'd say this -- don't support this garbage by renting or buying a ticket. If you HAVE to see it because you want to be duped by all the hype, wait until a friend has it and go to their home to view it. Or get it free at the library.

If I had to describe the movie: you know that one kid in your class who took taking high as a personality and thought being funny by saying totally arbitrary things, that kid would be less annoying than this movie. Just felt uncomplete and overdid the one concpted. Recently watched Monthy Python and that really shows how random can be funny, idem dito for the shows like adventure time. The weird things are funny, unique and sometimes cleverly found. This was just weird writing to be weird. Most critics and reviewer seem to describe this as genius, for me this was just a waste of my time and struggled with keeping attention. I do believe there are ways to make this movie good, but this just felt so artificially made and lacking. Would recommend everybody to skip this one, except if your somehow in a really quirky mood and you are easily enjoyed by 'random' things. The cinematography and action was actually pretty nice, but that was just a hard pill to swallow with all the ""weirdness"" the movie tried to push through my throat. Especially some scenes were beautiful comprised, kudos to that, but sadly a loss due to entirety of the movie.

5 June 2022,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"What did happen to that kid from Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom and The Goonies?

This movie will give you the answer!

Life is more than death and taxes for Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh.) She is a bored middle aged Chinese immigrant housewife stuck in a rut in a launderette somewhere in America.

Her meek husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) wants more to life and is getting ready for a divorce. Their daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) wants her lesbian girlfriend to be accepted as part of the family.

Everyone wants approval from Evelyn's father Gong Gong (James Hong.) The crusty tax inspector Deirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis) is gunning for Evelyn because of her expenses claims.

Suddenly another variant of Waymond appears and introduces Evelyn to the concept of the multiverse. Where she can gain some powers and skills. All so she can stop some the impending destruction of the multiverses from a weird bagel.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is basically another take on Dr Strange 2. It's overstuffed with freaky ideas that really leads to a multiverse of madness.

It has energy, philosophical ideas and pathos. Due to all the chaos some of the concepts end up in a cul de sac. It was overlong and maybe the appropriate endpoint would had been the two rocks in an alien planet.

Great performance from Yeoh, there is a version of her that is a famous film star that Everlyn is envious of. She holds the movie together and once again displays that she is more than a far eastern martial arts star.",8
15 April 2022,One of the more visually interesting films of recent memory,"I knew coming into this adventure, this film was going to be something unique and different. Created by the filmmaking duo aptly called ""Daniels,"" I was prepared for a cacophony of visuals that would melt my brain and force me to register images at an alarming rate. Unlike their previous venture where Daniels attempted to make a film comprising of tropes they loathed, they most likely were seeking to make one of the most philosophically dense movies on record. Needless to say....they pulled it off.

Like cramming a couple of semesters of beginning philosophy and psychology into one script, we get a pretty stark picture of what is happening in the life of our protagonist, Evelyn Wang. Her business is struggling, she is becoming distant from her daughter while embracing the poorer qualities of her father, her marriage is on the rocks and all of the mundane faux realities like taxes and business are colliding; becoming far too important in her life. There is a lot of internalized guilt on her part, and she is trying to utilize poor coping methods to deal with it. And then of course, she finds out she might be the most important person in the universe(s) even though it is blatantly clear she is the worst version of herself in all realities.

I won't get into the sci-fi mumbo jumbo of the film, but basically an all powerful being is looking to destroy the very fabric of space and time. We talk about multiverse theories and cause and effect theories while also meshing them with abandonment, guilt and insufficiency syndromes by Evelyn's character. As she struggles to figure out her place in all of this, she is being pulled in multiple directions by multiverse jumping men posing as her husband and father, while her daughter is essentially the representation of destruction. This is where things get heavy.

Is humility really possible if you can literally be anywhere at once? Is nihilism even possible with this kind of power in tow? How important is the meshing of tradition and progression to a person from an unique culture assimilating into a new one? Are women truly the destructors of reality as so many ""enlightened"" misogynists like to stupidly put it? Does an Everything Bagel really have everything? And why has Ke Huy Quan been off the map for so long? I mean he was great in his role, seamlessly switching between the overly nice Waymond Wang to his Alpha Universe version that can turn a fanny pack into a weapon of mass destruction.

There were a lot of things I didn't expect from this film and I hope some people remember it for the unique vision it had. Framing a story about the universe in danger while a mother and daughter come to terms with their differences makes for a fun coming of age story that does not reek of the usual step-by-step tropes. It was also great to see people like Michelle Yeoh and James Hong get some great roles for once. Kudos to the film makers on that one.

Go watch this film. It does drag a little in the middle but once you get into the final act you will definitely want to get the Blu-Ray because there are literally dozens of little detailed moments that will require a very slow run through. And in my book, that is a good thing.",8
15 April 2022,A Fun Ride...With Heart,"The first recommendation when watching EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE is to not try to figure out what is going on in this movie during the first 1/2 hour to 45 minutes. This will drive you mad. Just sit back and enjoy the mind-bending experience you are having.

After that point, either it will click in your brain...or it won't. If it does - great! If not...continue to sit back and enjoy the mind-bending experience you are having.

For...EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE is a trippy head-trip of a film that is certainly unique - but it also has something going for it that all good films do - characters that you will care about in a story that will touch your heart.

Written and Directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (SWISS ARMY MAN), EVERYTHING...tells the tale of unhappily married couple Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) and Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), her father Gong Gong (the great James Hong) and their daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu). When interdimensional travel interrupts their mundane life, things get much, much more than mundane.

Yes, folks, you read that right INTERDIMENSIONAL TRAVEL - and this is not a Marvel movie! Evelyn and family start jumping to parallel dimensions, experiencing everything, everywhere...all at once (hence, the name of the film).

This is a smart, unique and visually interesting film and credit for this must go to Wang and Scheinert. They have come up with something unusual. However, they don't just do ""unusual for unusual sake"" they wrap this film up - and connect the dots - in a satisfying way in the end. Oh...and they also build in some incredibly impressive fight scenes along the way. To not hype them too much, but these are the best fight scenes that have been on film in quite some time - certainly the most interesting and unique since the JOHN WICK films.

The duo, smartly, enlisted the aid of the underappreciated - but very talented - Michelle Yeoh (CRAZY RICH ASIANS) as the protagonist of this piece. It is a wise choice for she must go from mousey housewife to kick-butt SuperHero (and everywhere in between) throughout the course of this film and her Martial Arts background comes in very, very handy. It is a bravura performance by Yeoh and it would be TERRIFIC if her name is called come awards season next year (yes, it is that good of a performance).

She is ably assisted by Hong (a veteran character actor with more than 450 credits to his name), Hsu (known for her role as Mei in THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL) and, especially Quan (the kid ""Short Round"" who assists the hero in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM) - it was good to see Quan back on the big screen.

The filmmakers also sprinkle some very strong character actors/actresses in the mix here. Both Jenny Slate (Mona-Lisa Saperstein in PARKS & REC) and Harry Shum, Jr. (GLEE, CRAZY RICH ASIANS) are fun in small roles as is the aforementioned James Hong as Gong Gong (the Grandfather).

But...the person who ALMOST steals this film from Ms. Yeoh is the incomparable Jamie Lee Curtis as the somewhat overweight and out of shape IRS Agent who plays a pivotal role in Evelyn's life across the Dimensions. It is a fun role for Curtis who is not afraid to look physically bad. Again, I would LOVE IT if she got some love come awards time next year (she won't, but maybe in some other parallel Universe she would).

Not for everyone - the multi-dimensional travel is going to give some folks a headache as they try to figure things out - but if you surrender yourself to the wildness that is going on, and embrace the spirit and the heart of this film, you will be rewarded with a very rich film going experience.

13 January 2023,What was the point?,"I will agree with lots of poor reviews here by the audience. As much as I would like to love this film, it did not do something different for me. The concept of the film, the reasoning behind the plot is quite similar to the movie ""tenet."" And the reason is ""nothing at all.""

The movie runs us through the problems of the main character and how different choices made by her could have meant a ""better life"" than the one she already has. But the main reasoning for all of the action and plot was confined down to her daughter's issues with her. It'd have been interesting if the main character was the villain in the alternate universe, where she snapped and gotten all vengeful of the universe/s as she crumbled down the years of emotional and mental torture.

Also don't even get me started on the bagel. It was an annoying detail in the film, i don't know if I need to have an artistic mind to actually appreciate that concept but I truly do not.

It's a good action movie but not a great sci-fi movie. Which is why 7‚≠ê is for the action, acting and overall attractive scenes. You just have to turn your brain off in order to enjoy it without thinking about it in the back of your mind. The movie is infact not worth the hype, watching it or not watching it wouldn't make a difference in how you understand the concepts of science or the possibility of alternate realities.",7
19 April 2022,A wild ride,"Hold on tight. This is a wild ride! I knew nothing about this film. I hadn't heard of it, didn't know it was in production, nothing, until yesterday, when I saw this tweet from Neil Gaiman -""...See it in a cinema if you can. See it knowing nothin if you can. Best, most wonderful film I've seen in ages... Thank you Michelle Yeoh for existing."" Purely on that advice, I went to see it, as he suggested, ""See it knowing nothing if you can."" READ NO FURTHER if you want to take his advice. I don't know if there was a single department of this production that didn't excel. The writing was clever, unexpected, witty, deep, poignant, insane... the editing must have been an Herculean task and it is executed absolutely amazingly. The premises that are morphed together totally eclipse any singular focus on its own. Michelle Yeoh performance is indescribably brilliant. The supporting cast deliver with brilliance of their own. You will laugh out loud, cringe, gasp, cry, examine your life and be awestruck. I'll just stop, now, because I could go on ad nauseam. I give this film an enthusiastic 10 (superlative) out of 10 {no genre will be a sufficient label}",10

6 April 2022,"Contemporary cinema at its most cosmic yet most intimate, this is a triumph for the ages","Charlie Kaufman once wrote ""Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you'll never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out"". I can start with nothing better to talk about an immense new movie, the Daniels' ""Everything everywhere all at once"".

This hyperreal piece of art comes to us quietly sampling something that crosses our path only every decade or so to remind us that there is still more to explore in our collective cultural consciousness and that we are yet to discover a fraction of what a truly good script can do; How images can transform a script to something better, deeper, and more effective; How a harmonious marriage of script and picture can explore emotional depths that are commonly visited yet rarely understood. ""Everything everywhere all at once"" is only the second movie project of its writers/directors. Their first was a subject of small talks at drunk parties and ""the weirdest I have seen"" conversations, the story of a desperate loner who was saved by a dead body that mainly flatulates then comes alive to ask existential questions about the meaning of life, ""Swiss Army Man"". That project might have been too eccentric and much ahead of its time for the common taste, but it was a true eye-opener. Now, after 6 years since that ambitious project and the experience it distilled, comes this utterly more marvelous achievement.

""Everything everywhere all at once"" is impossible to describe and synopsizing it is unjust as it is a true and rare symbiosis of script and picture, each highlighting the other, making each and the whole something more than words can explain. But perhaps to describe it best -and you must see it yourself to try and state your own- it's a surreal psychedelic journey through the eyes of a financially struggling immigrant nuclear family with their crumbling owned business and their cyclical hopeless life and what bent it of their dying hopes, missed opportunities, decaying bounds, and their valiant efforts to maybe bring some love and tradition and purpose back to it. This essence of the story is challenged by the simple concept of ""what if"" through a theme of a multiverse with characters sliding through the different possible versions of themselves to try and find meaning through the overwhelming nonsense of their lives.

There are many aspects that make this movie a bombastic one. The screenplay introduces a simple premise but then quickly, continuously, and relentlessly evolves into absurd levels that are unpredictable and, frankly, unprecedented throughout the whole runtime, effectively challenging your sense of what is ""enough"". The story is an adventure of cosmic proportions of characters and characters' versions of themselves that then is juxtaposed with its intimate origins. And so, this gargantuan design is just an external manifestation of the emotional depths of a dialogue between a mother, a father, a daughter, a grandfather, and a tax auditor in the span of 6 hours of one day of their tiny lives. It's childish and hilarious and creepy. It is a meticulous machine that keeps discovering unimaginable dimensions to portray an intense emotional and philosophical battle between purpose and nihilism, and then purpose through nihilism. The script actively prevents itself from committing to a moral conclusion. It juggles continuously -as life is and any grasp on it- between the hopeful and the hopeless and is only bound by accepting the inevitability of chaos while rejecting the perceived destiny of loneliness.

This immense script wouldn't have made this piece without the visuals. Here, the actual pictures do not only serve as a representation of the script but also feel that they have their own identity. The visuals are utterly and out worldly surreal, like a Salvador Dal√≠ or a David lynch or a stargate sequence of Kubrick's Space Odyssey. They are beautifully influenced by the exciting and fun Chinese martial arts Jackie Chan movies, the action/mystery of ""The Matrix"", the eerie imagery of Charlie Kaufman's ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"", ""Synecdoche New York"", and ""Adaptation"", and Wong Kar-Wai's sexy romantic spectacle ""In the mood for love"".

Script and picture being their own separate entities in this movie needed a masterful editor, and here too it excels. This cinematic piece could have been easily a disorienting mess of random events and visual madness, but what the editing actually achieves is a story that is easily followed and understood with characters that are poignant, close, and intimate, creating relatability that captivates and elates. The acting is flawless, specifically on the parts of Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, who both complete and finesse. The cinema that comes from all these passionately crafted ingredients creates what can be described as a particle accelerator that elaborately assaults the senses, with passion, from every angle, generating a hilarious, creepy, and immensely emotional journey that will undoubtedly leave you to tears on many occasions, and then latch on to you with a fantastic and inspiring after taste.

The Daniels wrote and directed ""Everything everywhere all at once"" to make it look like a marvel blockbuster but with the spirit and the feel of an art-house independent picture, effectively thriving through the fierce competition that is threatening creativity in cinema. They -either willingly with the audacity of an artist, or instinctively through the passion of a child explorer- ditched the three-act structure of a script and then went above and beyond with a bizarre and mind-blowing cinematic exploration of the depths of meaning and love. It is contemporary yet traditional, enormous yet intimate, focused yet living up to its title; It is truly Everything first, everywhere second, then all together all at once. This picture is an absolute triumph, a true masterpiece, one of the best movies in the last 20 years, and one of the most beautiful things I personally have ever seen. Be sure not to miss it.",9
18 September 2022,Difficult to understand the 10/10 scores,"Finding it difficult to think of the words to use to review this movie.

Acting 9/10

Top notch performances from everyone involved. Yeoh in particular is magnificent. Great to see 'Shorty' make a major flick comeback

Plot 5/10

People seem to think it's hugely original but if you think about it, it's got loads ripped off from The Matrix. Some funny parts and an interesting concept but too slow, mainly due to the huge over use of slow motion effects

Entertainment 5/10

Some entertaining parts with nice choreography and fight scenes but it felt way too long and started to drag near the end

Cinematography 10/10

Some truly beautiful scenes and very well made

Characters 6/10

Lead and her husband are great. Her dad is great too. Daughter rather annoying.

Effects 10/10

Superb. Top notch, especially during a time of some diabolical CGI being used in media.

Dialogue 7/10

Great mix of the two languages. Some truly mental dialogue at times.

Longevity 3/10

I won't be watching it again. I feel like it won't be a long lasting classic that people talk about in the future.

Music 2/10

Actually pretty poor. Quite annoying and frustrating at times. Hurt my brain.

Flow/Pace 3/10

Far too slow and really dragged towards the end. Too much slow motion used.

14 April 2022,"A truly bizarre, fast-paced mind trip that revels in every minute of its originality","""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is a sci-fi action comedy film written and directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, a.k.a. ""Daniels"". Starring Michelle Yeoh in the lead role, it is a truly bizarre, fast-paced mind trip that revels in every minute of its originality.

For many years, Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) has run a family laundromat with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). Things aren't going too smoothly for Evelyn due to many amounting problems - the IRS is in the process of auditing the laundromat, Waymond is considering divorcing her, Evelyn's father Gong Gong (James Hong) has recently arrived from China, and Evelyn's daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) is struggling to convince her mother to accept her girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel). One day, Waymond's personality suddenly changes right in front of Evelyn and he reveals himself to be from an ""Alpha"" parallel universe. This Alpha version of Waymond informs Evelyn about the existence of different multiverses due to the abundance of choices people make all the time, and provides her with a device that allows her explore many different realities and borrow special powers from different variants of herself.

It seems that thanks to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the idea of multiverses and alternate realities have become rather popular with audiences lately, and for that I couldn't be happier. I've always enjoyed fiction that deals with hypothetical scenarios in which we see how differently things may have turned out had one small little thing happened instead of what we actually ended up with. In ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"", we are treated to a surreal, over-the-top exploration of multiple possible timelines in one of the most uniquely strange films I've seen in a long time.

This film takes the very concept of exploring the multiverse and flips it on its head, quite literally sometimes and often with humorous results. I was surprised how many times I spontaneously laughed out loud at certain parts just out of sheer absurdity, but it never felt like I was doing so at the film's expense. We see so many different twists and turns throughout that it's hard for me to definitively categorise what they are truly about. One scene may involve a reality where people have hotdogs for fingers and the other might feature literal rocks with googly eyes as the variants of our main characters. Yet, strangely, this film has created a world where all of these things could plausibly exist. It would have been easy for the film to be simply weird for the sake of it, but there's a certain cadence to all this weirdness that makes it so appealing to watch in the long run.

The two Daniels (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) have clearly given close attention-to-detail to every scene of this film. Most of the time we are shown several blink-and-you-miss-it moments alluding to what particular version of Evelyn may be like in a certain reality or which of her obscure memories may be the trigger towards gaining that one's power. I can't discuss these in too much detail here, not just because I am reluctant to give away spoilers but also because even as I write this I'm still trying to fully comprehend what I have watched. Due to all the intricately hidden things that will likely go over people's heads, this is the type of movie that will require multiple viewings. However, I believe this is a good thing since it will help it attain the cult status it rightfully deserves. Not many movies released these days have the courage to go all out with this much passion and charm, especially one distributed by an independent company like A24.

There's more good news - the action is fantastic as well. The fight choreography is so well done you'd be hard pressed finding better hand-to-hand combat outside of a Jackie Chan film (funnily enough, Chan was actually the original choice for the lead before the filmmakers decided to make her a woman). Even better is that the shaky-cam elements are kept to minimum, which makes it easier for us to see who is fighting whom. The high quality of the action scenes in this film can likely be attributed to the involvement of the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who serve as co-producers. Their creative fingerprints have been left on this film as that same style of MCU action and fun is definitely present here. Any fan of the MCU will be aware of the Russo brothers' important contribution to the series in that they knew how to correctly balance character development with solid action sequences to go along with it.

If there's any person who can truly hold this crazy but wonderful film together, it's Michelle Yeoh in the main role as Evelyn. Just watching the way Evelyn goes from a frustrated family woman struggling to make ends meet to a full blown action hero in the same movie is quite a staggering accomplishment. Yeoh never misses a beat battling her way through adversaries from unfamiliar realities while borrowing powers from her variant counterparts. I think it's safe to say this is the best performance she's ever given in a film, even more so than in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Additionally, we also see the surprising return of Ke Huy Quan to the big screen as Evelyn's husband Waymond. For those who don't know, Quan played Short Round in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and Data in ""The Goonies"" when he was a child. It's nice to see that Quan's acting talent hasn't waned as an adult and his inclusion in the film's cast should make for an amusing, albeit minor nostalgia trip for fans of 80s movies.

With the endless possibilities a multiverse can present, ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" has successfully established itself as one of the most unique films of the 2020s. It's rare for such an ambitious, risk taking venture to have made so many different elements work so harmoniously but every now and then a film like this comes along and shatters all our expectations. This is the type of film you could watch over and over and still find something new to talk about each time. Because of that, I foresee the film achieving cult status in a matter of years, especially among fans of time travel and surrealist cinema. However, this can only occur if enough people end up seeing it in the first place so if all of what I described sounds exciting to you, what are you waiting for?

I rate it a solid 9/10.",9
10 April 2022,Bonkers and insane... one of the most original and creative films in years!,"This is a movie you must experience for yourself to fully grasp exactly what it is. I absolutely loved it, and yet I find myself unable to write a coherent review... because the movie is absolutely crazy, as well as being cinematic perfection. It's one of the greatest films I have ever seen, or rather, experienced! Instead of writing a full review, I feel this movie is best described in points, because I don't want to say too much about anything, I just want this to convince anyone reading this to go out and see it as soon as they can (in theatres with an audience)! It's the most original and creative piece of filmmaking I have witnessed in probably the last 5 years, I just can't believe what the directorial duo Daniels was able to pull off here! So without further ado, here are my thoughts on ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"":

* The film is flawless and true cinematic perfection in my eyes!

* An assault on the senses; the visuals and sound design are insane!

* Extremely impressive from a technical standpoint.

* Editing is a huge standout and was incredibly done, the edit alone took us on a ride! They used match cuts so creatively too!

* Cinematography was stunning, I especially loved the creative use of lighting!

* Sound design was absolutely crazy, it had so much going on and complimented the visuals perfectly!

* Every genre of film in one!

* I've never seen anything like it, it's ambitious, crazy, bonkers, insane, creative, hilariously funny, heartfelt, clever, wild, awesome, the best, odd, wacky, touching, chaotic but in a well-written way, stylized, brilliant, and most of all, masterful!

* None of this movie should work, and yet due to the Daniels' excellent and clever direction, it somehow does (and yet I still don't know how they were able to pull it off) * There is no way Multiverse of Madness will be half as crazy as this movie, this is the best multiverse film we will probably ever see * The writing so cleverly establishes the multiverse rules and keeps it flowing in a way that allows you to feel like you understand what's going on despite how complex it gets. It perfectly guides you through the story without spoon-feeding it to you, making sure the chaotic multiverse makes sense.

* Also loved the thematic exploration in the story, and that they didn't let the novelty and entertainment value of the multiverse stuff take away from the story, it just complemented it instead. It's some genius writing, especially when heading into the second half of the film where the emotional/thematic core really starts to open up and shine!

* Action is phenomenal and intense. It's some of the best I've seen in the last few years, it's so wild! It's very stylized and impressive, the Daniels know how to direct action so well. They get great coverage that shows off the choreography and every hit, and perfect timing for cuts.

* The film is so funny, has some witty dialogue, insane gags that I never saw coming, and some hilarious comedic payoffs - one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while, it had both me and the audience howling with laughter!

* Michelle Yeoh's performance is astonishing! She's just awesome as the lead; she's so badass in her action scenes, so funny, and yet still gives such an emotional, heartfelt performance * I also loved Ke Quan as her husband, he was so loveable and had some of the funniest moments. So great to see him acting again, have really missed him since his days in ""Indiana Jones"" and ""The Goonies"".

* Stephanie Hsu was phenomenal as the daughter, and a huge part of why the 2nd half of the film works as well as it does!

* Jamie Lee Curtis had me laughing so hard, she was hilarious here, I've never seen her do anything like this!

This film does things you would never expect to see, and I loved it for that! I was enamoured by this film, it's truly a glorious piece of filmmaking. It's one of the coolest films of the last decade and I cannot stop thinking about it. I really want to see it again too, it's so much to take in on first viewing! Daniels truly knocked it out of the park on all levels; as a comedy, action film, familial drama, sci-fi film, something that's thought provoking and emotionally potent, technically impressive and so imaginative. It's just a masterpiece; cinematic perfection. It left me with a feeling of pure joy, I really hope everyone gets a chance to experience this film. You have to see it in a theatre with an audience... it's an insane experience! I just loved it, highly recommend! The film's title really says it all; it's ""Everything Everywhere All At Once""!",10
25 August 2022,"I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish, I Wish","I wish I could lend my eyes and ears and my mind to the ones who didn't quite grasp this movie so they too could see how every single scene in it is a marvel.

30 April 2022,Everything,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is the best movie I've seen so far this year and it'll be hard to top, it blew me away in every way possible, this is one of the most original stories and plots I've ever seen in my life, with some of the most creative stylistic decisions I've ever seen, this movie will be hard to top.

This film has an unbelievable cast, Michelle Yeoh KILLED it as Evelyn, but Ke Huy Quan was absolutely phenomenal, and it was unbelievable how long he hasn't acted and how well he pulled it off, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years, with fantastic action sequences and an epic ending.

Everything Everywhere All At Once is a beautiful, hilarious, heartbreaking movie with one of the most interesting parent and child dynamics ever, they threw everything at the screen, and this is the best A24 film since Midsommar

And, it's the first movie in 2022 to get an A+",10
24 January 2023,Something missing for me,"This is typically the sort of movie I'd spend days thinking about and then come to the conclusion it's absolutely brilliant. Despite having all the right ingredients, that didn't quite happen this time around.

The average viewer is going to struggle getting through the first half because it's slow, confusing and has a lot of subtitles to get through. Which is a shame because the magic in the movie is definitely in the 2nd half.

Ultimately it's a high concept movie that can be explained quite simply but not without spoilers. However the basic premise in the movie sees the main character Evelyn, a run of the mill middle aged family woman, interact with the multiverse to save every universe.

Whilst it is visually stunning and one of the most creative movies you'll have seen in a while, I feel it falls somewhere between serious philosophical sci-fi and in part daft comedy and doesn't quite blend them well enough. There are two food based elements of the story which could have been something different and it would have A) made more sense and B) made a more satisfying story.

This is definitely the kind of movie that can split the crowd, with the average viewer unlikely to give it much of a go. So the current iMDB rating of 8 at the time of writing this review did surprise me, but fair play.

Great visuals, quality acting, awesome ideas but something is missing for me.",7
27 March 2022,Best Action Movie in Years. Offers so much!,"This movie is quite literally everything. A little romantic, a little endearing, hilarious, absurd, absurd again, brilliant, exciting -- all the things.

It's Lucy meets Ligion with a hint of The Matrix and some Shaolin.

This movie will blow your mind, and have you shift from laughing to crying from one scene to the next. It's beautiful and remarkable and incredibly memorable.

I could not endorse this movie more.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head.

Stephanie Hsu is not a very good actor and I wish someone else had played her parts. She didn't convince me at all in this role. I'm sorry I'm negative to this movie but what can I say? I absolutely love a good movie but this was not my cup of tea AT ALL.

12 March 2023,"Confusing, annoying and insulting","This movie was supposed to be the best ever, but it just freaked me out. The movie is all over the place and the depth it could have had is ruined by randomness, absurd humor and pretenciousness. In one of the scenes the characters suddenly have sausages instead of fingers and they make a pretensious referance to A space odyssey where the pre human apes fight with sausage fingers. Maybe that's just humourous and well meant, but I could hardly watch. It's impossible to tell if this movie is a comedy or an action movie or a deep drama and if such confusion is your thing, then maybe you would love it. I could barely stand it.

11 April 2022,A first-rate fantasy about the multiverse and much more with Michelle Yeoh at the top of her game.,"Here is a kaleidoscopic ride through the multiplicity of an individual's possibilities that will amuse and astound you with what a life can be. Try to find a more imaginative film out there today or in recent memory. You won't.

Everything Everywhere All at Once depicts a Chinese immigrant, Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), empowered to travel multiverses to confront the many selves she could have been in order to save the world and more importantly her family. Like Lars Van Trier's Melancholia, this fantasy is an answer for what to do about clinical depression: Face your many demons and vanquish them with the sheer power of love.

Everything is more impressionistic than narrative, offering exotic takes on our culture like satirizing the animation Ratatouille by placing a raccoon on the head of a chef and calling it Raccacoonie (Jason Hamer) or having Jamie Lee Curtis play Dierdre Beaubeirdra, an out-of-control IRS agent storming the Wang family's struggling laundry. Directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, labeled as ""Daniels,"" have taken their Swiss Army Man to a manic level even that quirky film couldn't imagine.

In comments on the world as we perceive it, Everything references the popular theme of rediscovering family, so prevalent in super hero movies and elsewhere. Yeoh as Evelyn is a perfect heroine because her current self, which she considers a failure, becomes an active psychic traveler cum martial arts dynamo experiencing the lives she could have led. The branching choices she can make at any moment propel her into different outcomes. It's what we oft have thought about the many possibilities we have within our grasp every moment of our lives.

Easy to see the themes bounce out, like becoming all you can be and loving family, such as her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), whom she strives to save from the negative forces of the world. Similarly, she struggles with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), to serve him divorce papers while every step of the multiverse he travels proves to be dangerous and loving.

In the chaos each day brings, destruction around each corner, madness omnipresent, the film manages to lard its scene with kindness sneaking through each frame. Gone is the tyranny of the pandemic; here is the chance for salvation through charity that accepts our weaknesses for the sake of love.

Here is The Matrix reimagined for those still reeling from the perceived mania of the Trump era. Buttplugs and an alpha version of Evelyn's boring husband are two of the many running gags that challenge us to think of our personal multiverses as not just daily apocalypses but containing everything to help us through to the best universe of all-a loving one.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is everything cinema should be: stunning, challenging, witty, amusing, and true to life in its infinite forms.

In theaters, thank goodness, because of the brilliant images and mind-capturing sound.",
8 April 2022,"My expectations were high, but....wow","You see people say things like ""a once in a lifetime movie"" or ""run, don't walk to the theater!"" and it's easy to dismiss because they seem sensationalized. This was the first movie I have seen in a LONG time where I don't think that's an exaggeration. Sweet, sad, touching, hilarious, crazy, doesn't even begin to describe this one. Wonderful performances and the runtime flew by. Entertaining from beginning to end. I'm trying to avoid saying much, because I'd hate to ruin anything for you. Just go see it.

18 April 2022,The most bizarre movie to never have a moment that didn't make sense,"I had succesfully avoided any trailers or spoilers prior to seeing this film. All that I knew was that my favorite film critics were calling it excellent and weird. While both of these are true, I want to offer what may be a common praise but I have yet to see because I am reviewing blindly: this film handles absurdism in the most realistic way I have ever seen. Taken out of context, numerous scenes from this movie would be the most ridiculous thing you have seen on the big screen. But every single one of the bits and jokes and plot devices works within the context of the film, which is so beautiful. I don't know that I count this as spoiler so I feal comfortable saying, there is a bit where two objects are talking to one another that is so absurd, but it serves to eventually be the most poignant symbolism in the entire runtime.

Of note, Stephanie Hsu is an absolute standout. I am scrolling through her film history now to add things to my watchlist because she was so phenomonal. I assume she had a blast with the role given the context of the character, as did the design team. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film you won't soon forget, and you should see soon so that you can be in the conversation if it is ever brought up, inevitably, for years to come.",9
8 April 2022,"Crazy, Funny, and Heartwarming","What makes this film exciting is not its premise, but its execution. Each scene demonstrates the creativity and silliness of the filmmakers, as well as the talent of the actors to pull off such caricatures. The cherry on top is the beautiful message of the film; it somehow grabs you and doesn't let go.

14 March 2023,Funny and emotional with a kind message at it's heart.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

30 April 2022,One for the Ages,"When it comes to independent films, namely the studio A24, I'm always eager to watch. As much as I do love going to see blockbusters on opening weekend, it's really all about how good a story is for me when it comes down to it. Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of A24's latest releases now playing in theatres and I haven't seen a film this weird and also thought-provoking in all the best ways, in a very long time. It's been almost a week since I've seen it and I'm just now wrapping my head around what I watched. When I first heard about this film I was excited, but I didn't expect how deep it would be under the surface.

To put it as simply as possible, Everything Everywhere All at Once is about Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh), a woman who is struggling to keep her business going. As she's being audited an opportunity presents itself. Since she's in just a bind, she goes along with it, but it unleashes an endless number of realities. Being able to see many different versions of herself, her husband, her daughter, and many others, she basically discovers what her life could've been like, for better or worse. On top of that, abilities are garnered by her, due to the studying and linking of her other, smarter selves. The way this film gets to its climax was both wacky and emotional for me.

This is the first review I've written in a while where I don't feel the need to complain about a single thing and also don't want to get into too many details and ruin it for anyone. I will say that it's absolutely not for everyone, simply due to the sheer weirdness of it all. This will more than likely turn off some viewers. Yes, it's incredibly weird and off-putting at times, but if you really think about the visuals on-screen, the meaning behind it all and where it leads just brought me to tears. Speaking of the visuals, for a smaller budgeted film, I was blown away by how this film was made and looked overall.

In the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once earns one of the biggest recommendations from me in quite some time, but I also want to warn those who aren't a fan of weird cinema. It's bonkers in all the best ways. I loved the direction by both Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, but I wasn't surprised by that because I loved their previous film, Swiss Army Man, which is arguably even weirder. From the technical achievements to the moving dialogue, to the straight-up cheer-worthy strangeness that it has to offer, I walked out of this film overjoyed. Everything Everywhere All at Once deserves to be recognized for awards all year long and I hope it continues to get the attention it very much deserves.",10
20 March 2023,I wanted to love it- was MEH.,"After all the awards hype, I finally watched this mess. To be fair, it was an original concept and for that it was refreshing. The actors did wonderfully with the material.

I just didn't really care for all they crammed into it. I do prefer a linear story and this was not that. So my MEH, is based on a self preference and not based on presentation by these fine actors.

Honestly, not all movies are meant for everyone.

Please give it 15 minutes of your time, before you dismiss it. I think that entertaining the masses is a hard job and although this was my take on it, you should make up your own mind!!

20 March 2023,Practically impossible to describe...you just need to see it for yourself.,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a nearly impossible film to describe. Suffice to say, the plot is very weird and existential...and defies my ability to explain it. In other words, just see the film and have no expectations regarding the story. Suffice to say the story is bizarre and is a combination of drama, comedy and sci-fi/fantasy. Whether you love it or not will really depend on your willingness to watch the film without trying to think about the plot too much. If you think too much, you may find yourself bogged down by details or a desire to make sense of everything...and I highly recommend against this.

While I did not love this film enough to imagine it receiving so many Oscars, I must admit that the acting was exceptional. My only complaint is that although Jamie Lee Curtis was fine in the movie, I think Stephanie Hsu (who also was nominated) seemed more deserving of the Best Supporting Actress award. My assumption is that Curtis' was more a career achievement award, like John Wayne's for ""True Grit"".

12 March 2023,I get the movie,"But it's so fast moving and hard to understand that I don't want to follow it - it's a waste of my brainpower. I see why Michelle was nominated. She is a good actress, and I'm glad Asians are getting treated like they deserve to be treated. This movie is just not my cup of tea. I have it on now, and it's an hour into the movie, and I have to turn it off. Okay, they're saying I have to write more in order for this to get posted, so I will write more. I have been thinking about the possibility of past lives before I saw this movie, but, I didn't know what to expect of this movie. If I were a kid, I'd love it, but I wouldn't get the meaning. I'm not a kid, though, and I get it, but I don't love it.

30 May 2022,Rubbish,"Maybe I'm missing something obvious but I thought this was a load of rubbish. I read the reviews before watching and say everyone raving about how great it was. What I saw was the bizarre storyline, characters jumping into parallel universes that were just weird. People in other worlds with hotdogs for fingers, talking rocks or someone with a talking racoon on his head gives you an idea how bizarre it is. The cinema was pretty empty anyway but 6 people walked out after about an hour, that again tells you everything. I stayed hoping it would improve and it didn't. Unless you like these Matrix style, alternate universe style films I would't waste your time.

13 May 2022,This must be what it was like watching The Matrix in 1999,"Wow, what an experience. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a genre-defining masterpiece. I haven't been this in awe of a film in a long time. It mixes so many disparate elements together to create a kaleidoscope of profound commentary on the world we live in.

The mix of martial arts, absurdism, comedy, and family drama makes this a truly original film. I went from laughing out loud at one moment to having tears in my eyes in the next. The mixing of this is so seamless. The script is razor sharp and everything that happens occurs for a reason that is later explained and leaves you in awe. Michelle Yeoh is outstanding and should get serious awards consideration. This film should be the absolute frontrunner for Best Picture and I really hope it wins.

12 May 2022,Blew Me Away,"This movie is on par with ""The Matrix"" for offering a mind-blowing plot with terrific special effects. I won't go into the plot much cause I feel like you need to go into this movie as blind as possible. Don't let the first twenty minutes fool you, it seems like a sappy drama about a down-on-their-luck family at first, but it quickly heats up and will leave you completely stunned.

The special effects and the choreography and the acting: all terrific. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong, Jamie Lee Curtis. All amazing here.

Do yourself a favor and check this one out. It's already received rave reviews among critics and on this site, and I have no doubt that it will receive a lot of gold at awards ceremonies next year.

18 January 2023,"Funny, ridiculous, and poignant...","üî• RATED PHOENIX üî•

I'm just going to go around in circles for this review, so for a tl;dr: Everything Everywhere All At Once is perfection. It's a rapturous cinematic experience that takes the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster through existential dread, the crushing burden of expectations, and the overwhelming nature of life. It's funny, ridiculous, poignant, and, above all, unashamedly hopeful. In spite of its themes, Everything reminds us that, even when the world overwhelms us and brings us to our lowest, there are moments, moments when, sometimes, just sometimes, we can overwhelm the world.

17 April 2022,"Gratuitous weirdness, but that's the whole point","It's hard to criticize this film cause it works as a an insane story, in an insane world, and is obviously appreciated by many people.

Strange how it was like a rollercoaster ride but also really boring at the same time, with no real purpose beyond 'be kind', and 'accept people'. Both nice themes but paper-thin to sustain a 2+ hour movie.

There's a superficial level of excitement, a key element of the plot is 'do random stuff' and that's okay, but beyond that there's not much more. It just depends on how you like your entertainment.

8 April 2022,It's a lot....,"8.3/10

This isn't much of a review, but it's a small tidbit on the film

This film is absolutely true to its name. It's pure chaos with so much going on. I don't think I have a big enough brain to explain what I watched. The cinematography, score, story, and acting were all just spectacular.

The meaning of the story was ultimately the thing that made me most pleased with the film. We all have stuff going on in our lives and though we may be distracted by them. If we be true to ourselves and those we care about we can come out on top.

Overall, if you can get past reading subtitles this is a film I would recommend checking out. It's pure chaos, but it tells a compelling story.

Thank you for taking the time to read this very short, and not entirely helpful review, but I hope someone gets something out of it. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",8
8 July 2022,Trying too hard to be quirky?,"Sorry, I kind of feel crazy for not loving this film as much as the masses do. It definitely was interesting and highly original and a lot of it was fun and I thought the ending was particularly moving.....but a lot of it just also felt like it was weird for the sake of being weird. Like, did we need to have so much focus on hot dog finger world? I can get the irony of the mom's relationship in that universe but it otherwise didnt really serve anything narratively. It felt like they kept cutting back to it purely because it was ridiculous. I just didnt find the scene where Jenny Slate swings around a dog to be particularly funny. I liked the visuals in the movie and Stephanie Hsu wears some pretty rad costumes. But overall, it felt really long and overstuffed and like it was trying too hard. It certainly wasnt a bad film. Just not my cup of tea personally.

6 April 2023,Overrated populist surrealism with a twist,"I'm convinced we're living in the only universe where this film becomes the most awarded ever - even above LOTR.

In short; it's overrated. In long; it's a brilliant (although overdone) showcase of the multiverse theory - which I have a strong suspicion most viewers weren't familiar with until watching this film. This is populist Sci-Fi surrealism given yet more momentum by the social justice headline of its mainly asian cast.

The writers posed the question - what if somebody could become anything? Why must somebody only engage with, and be limited to, their subjective existence? We could have been a singer, or a chef, or a movie star in another life. It's a creative and innovative premise. We may naturally like our familiar subjective existence; it provides meaning, a point of reference, a starting place to build out from in relation to other things around us. That's the overarching dilemma of the film; the main character experiencing their life as it might've been in various other universes (possibilities) by universe hopping. It just takes a long while to get to the final epiphany.

As the film's title suggests, this is a bombardment of everything, everywhere, all at once. It's a maximalist explosion of possibilities, restrained only by its budget, whilst fiercely driven by heaps of overambitious imagination. Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn is a strong performance that encapsulates the Chinese immigrant mother, she's quickly swept into the storm of everything. Other members of the family such as Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) and Gong Gong (James Hong), are given only moments of real dialogue before they too, are seemingly lost in the midst of the film's chaos.

Most of the film's unduly long runtime is a messy fancy dress brawl which quickly grows tiresome. Other angles of engaging with the multiverse weren't explored much beyond how it can apply to having, well, a massive and progressively boring fight. That being said, these *are* full-blown fight scenes choreographed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' Brian and Andy Le, but it amounts to an excess of their choreo expertise.

A strong point besides it's novel theme, was the camera work, imagery, and lighting. This is consistent eye-candy in a constant flux of movement and dynamism. Images machine-gun themselves into your retina. Representing ""everything"" really takes some serious visual stimuli, and they've put in the hours to do just that.

There are some utterly inspirationally beautiful one-liners and social commentaries in this film too. Evelyn mentions that in a universe where we don't have access to our hands, we get real good with our feet. It's expressions like that which stay with you long after viewing.

Overall, as another reviewer puts it - the film becomes oversaturated with its own brilliance, becoming a formless splurge of Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time.

Most of the reviews are horrible yet it won all the awards. No. Im all about creativity but no way. I could not even watch all the way through. It was like a train wreck meets drowning and a panic attack. Academy, who are you? Please stop; it sort of makes the Academy seem unhinged. I think there are enough lying liars in the world without pretending Horrible movies are good movies. From now on, the nominated movies will be my list of ""do not watch under any circumstances."" The opposite of everything is true is now the United States.

11 April 2022,"crazy, crazy, crazy, did I say crazy?","This movie is insane. It has multiple universes, an IRS audit, oddball comedy, insane action sequences featuring buttplug statues and dildos to name a few, a main character who is a middle aged low-wage immigrant worker, her husband who is scared of her and wants to divorce her (at least in the main universe). And none of those are really the main storyline. The main storyline is a troubled mother and daughter struggling to connect due to a variety of factors. And it's later revealed that this issue stretched across multiple universes and realities to which it manifests itself in an absolutely bonkers way. The movie sometimes puzzles over what reality....is....man...you know. And how small we are, whatever we are.

Overall I felt the pace and moment where the 2nd act meats the 3rd act was the weakest part. I felt like it the pacing near the last 45 minutes seemed too slow as well. I also think it might have been improved if one or two of the alternative universes had been cut to keep the story more digestible.

But overall I had a fun time. I want to reassure people that I'm not someone who always loves crazy, artsy, sci-fi movies. I despised, the Matrix movies, Tenet and The Green Knight movies for instance. And all of those films have similarities to this one. However, this movie has moments which I found very funny. It doesn't treat the sci-fi concepts too seriously when they're clearly ridiculous. And it does take the family dynamic between the characters seriously. And that to me makes this movie worth watching and recommending. It's probably more fun to see while on drugs. I'm sure it has as a lot of interesting Easter eggs to spot on additional viewings as well. The acting and cinematography are great. The script is good given how many issues it could have had for how ambitious the scale is for this story. Overall, it's a film I would recommend. Just prepare yourself for insanity beforehand, and you'll only be rather surprised by what you see. Luckily it's also engaging and emotionally relatable rather than just odd for the sake of being odd.",8
17 May 2022,Truly original,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film like no other that effortlessly switches between painfully funny comedy, impressive action and heartfelt drama. A truly original film that covers so many genres and ideas without ever losing sight of the extremely emotional core at the centre of its truly ambitious narrative.

Michelle Yeoh has never been better with an incredible lead performance that utilises all of her talents. Ke Huy Quan makes a triumphant return with a performance and character that's endlessly loveable. Stephanie Hsu is also impressive, skillfully switching between antagonist and emotional core.

The direction by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert is phenomenal, always visually striking, endlessly inventive and the fight scenes are impressively shot, exciting and impactful. The visual effects are ridiculously impressive, especially considering the lower budget.

The pacing is extremely strong, gaining momentum early on and never losing it. The music by Son Lux is fantastic, swapping genres along with film perfectly whilst also keeping the core style and voice when necessary.",10

21 January 2023,Don't Judge Until the End,"There are many split universe movies out there like Mr. Nobody, Cloud Atlas, Dr. Strange, etc. But I think this one has the best balance of any that I've seen so far. It is just complex enough.

Only a couple of small critiques before I gloat. Some of the scenes were so ridiculous (yet funny) that it can take you out of it. Also, not to be hypercritical but because there were so many special effects, some came a little short.

With that being said.. you have to appreciate how much work went into making this movie. Not only is it visually stimulating, it is also emotionally and comically stimulating as well. Haven't had a good chuckle and cry like this in a while. I was skeptical halfway through the movie but it came together quite beautifully and had to actively remember the things I did not love while watching it.

13 June 2022,"Good, but not *that* good.","Giving this a 9 or 10 is just bonkers.

First half was interesting and funny and the over the top 'fights' were a joy. 2nd part tried to be artsy... and failed... tried to be ""dramatic""... and failed.

Last part went back to being interesting and fun to watch. I'd give it an 8 if the middle part wasn't so bad.

Story is fairly original, but could definitely feel a ton of 'The Matrix"" vibes.

I think the entire think was just some random lady that suddenly had a psychotic break and imagined the entire thing.

1 April 2022,First movie I've ever attended to receive an applause across the theater,"Nihilism explored in such a perfect, creative, mind-boggling and hilarious way.

I walked out of the theater feeling elevated in a way I've never experienced from a movie.

I'm not a wordsmith and have never left a movie review, but this movie deserves it. People need to know how amazing it is!

To everyone involved in bringing this movie to life: Thank you.

31 December 2022,A fun idea that came off dull.,"The biggest complaint I have is that the movie seemed to start at the end of the first act. The setup of this ""world"" seemingly happened for the sake of happening. If you can accept the premise, then you will enjoy the movie.

For me, it didn't earn my attention. I found myself watching the movie and liking the concepts, but not caring. It felt like I knew the ending before it came. Usually this wouldn't bother me, but I thought about the ending because I wanted it to come faster than it did. Most of the meat of the movie is good, but nothing is ever great.

With an almost no first act, it's like a tripod with 2 legs that slowly toppled over. The top of the tripod was filled with good acting, good action, good direction... but none of it was strong enough to support a score better than just above average.

2 June 2022,Extraordinary,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

8 September 2022,3 course-chocolate-mousse-meal,"I was positively surprised with the first 30 minutes as I had not watched the trailer and was not expecting anything special. Well, it was special and I enjoyed it even though I felt like stuck in a nightmare watching the scenes and jokes repeating again and again. What sounded like a genius plot at first, quickly becomes an everlasting dad joke as the story unfolds.

Ironically, the story lacks of dimensions. It felt like we are served a nice chocolate mousse as a starter and then the main course is also a chocolate mousse and surprise surprise the dessert is also a chocolate mousse. You still eat it because you like it but it does not taste the same at some point.

One important disclaimer comes from the fact that I did not watch EEAAO in the theater, which I heard is a game changer. However, I do not believe that sound or visual effects could improve the flatness of the jokes.",6
24 March 2023,Complete and utter bonkers,"Whenever I approach a film with an interesting, different concept, an inevitable anxiousness grips me for there is a fine line between originality and imaginative, crazy rubbish. I feel a great sense of dread in saying that I think Everything Everywhere All at Once falls into the latter category. There is no doubt that it is original, but there is also no doubt that it is perhaps the furthest we can stray from reality. My first misgivings about the film is with its philosophical meaning. The film explores nihilism and absurdism(that there is no meaning in life) by making it a character motivation(can we even call jobu Tupaki a human character?). It resolves everything neatly by arriving at the sagely solution that kindness and humanity is the way to go. The philosophy in this movie however appears overwrought and dumbed down. The themes of Nihilism and absurdism are never fully fleshed out - we do not closely see the life experiences or factors which motivated the characters to adopt this nihilistic attitude. In this respect the film lags behind other superior philosophy movies(namely The Truman Show or Groundhog day). While the first 40 minutes or so are agreeably fast paced and interesting, the film offers a sensory and factual overload afterwards that dulls its vigour by focusing a great deal on this philosophical theme, rather than continuing the enjoyable adventure mood. Everything everywhere all at once is convoluted, absurd, and intellectually astounding(in a negative sense). It seemed as if the film was hiding the poor logic and reason linking its various scenes behind the term ""absurdist"". Of course, I do realise my opinion run contrary to most of the general public and critic population, and I do not intend to pontificate my opinion, rather to record down what I felt of the film. Filmgoers should see this film because it's high ratings mean they are more likely to enjoy it than I did, but I must say, Everythign Everywhere all At Once is, in my opinion at least, a disappointing collection of preposterous situations bordering on claptrap.",3
31 March 2023,too old for it,"I suppose, I am too old, at my 47 , for this film. Imaginative, energetic, honestly crazy and chaotic, a script created by a sort of too lonely teen, isolated in his room and writing all the thoughts delivered by imagination, fake and childish, a mix of fantaisies, truisms and cliches, it has, for me, a basic virtue - it was the trampoline, for three actors who I appreciate, to have the Oscar prize, against their silly roles in this pure awfull film.

It is a huge puzzle, with familiar influences or references, with a bizarre story, translating some slices from near reality and viewers dreams , but having, obvious, as target, the young - young people, technologized, feeling , in intense manner, the term cool .

Sure, some compensations but for me , a middle age Romanian, an experiment, the relation parents - children or burocracy, Jamie Lee Curtis becoming Michael Myers , the presence of venerable James Hong working only as a sort of...spices in this case.

So, something saves it ?

I suppose, all sins, mistakes, eccentricities are compensated by beautiful eulogy of family, just touching . And by image and the hard try of a large, tenatious team, to show their absolutely crazy perspective about life, mixing obvious truths and large slices of fairy tales themes.

So, a film for very - very young audience.",
26 March 2022,Shut up and just appreciate your life!,"What better, more urgent message can a film have these days? What's so uncool about movies with messages anyways? Sometimes we desperately need them. I read a couple of reviews lightly mocking any attempt to find deeper meaning amid all the silliness, as if there wasn't enough already on the surface. What if we stopped equating tiny with insignificant? What if the more minuscule we discovered ourselves to be, the LARGER our world became, and the more SIGNIFICANT we felt? So it's not surprising that Daniels take us on the most inventive, overstuffed, relentless journey only to land us in the simplest, most heartfelt of places. That's the real judo-move here -- an infectious, goofy sweetness that extends even to the (hundreds? Thousands?) of action set pieces. Anyone can dimension-hop and fight the baddies. This combination of heart and spirit is the Daniels own. Also, for anyone who's putting together the next time capsule of human civilization, please consider the scene of Michelle Yeoh and Jaime Lee Curtis dancing with wiener fingers.

21 January 2023,A great film to watch during Chinese New Year,"Let me say something everyone hasn't said about this film much.

I've never respected an actor more than Ke Huy Quan, he's just extremely charming and wholesome all the time, a really good actor with range of being impressively serious and silly at any time, and has good chemistry with everyone. Michelle Yeoh may be the star but Ke Huy Quan just steals the whole film for me by being the heart of it all, it was a triumphant return to Hollywood after years of child actor stardom and came back with a show stopper, representing every philosophy I respect, and he absolutely deserved that Golden Globe and maybe an Oscar nomination would be nice.

That's all I have to say that hasn't been said before in other reviews.

14 January 2023,Hitchhikers Guide meets Kung Fu Hustle meets the Matrix,"I enjoyed this movie for what it was. Pros: decent acting, great action sequences, good cinematography, great imagery.

Cons: Loads of cliches, sophomoric humor, sloppy writing, overly baked, unoriginal.

It's definitely par for the course in an age of short attention span and low expectations. A high pace tempo and colorful style to keep the masses dopamine flowing.

I'm not surprised it's rated so high, considering how Hollywood force feeds movies like ""Glass Onion"" and Marvel down our throats. But at the same time, this movie was enjoyable enough to get something out of it, Pure energy. This is not a mind blowing movie and not nearly as intelligent as the mainstream believes it to be.

10 April 2022,Quite brilliant,"Wonderful and exciting film. Michelle Yeoh is extremely underrated and I'm happy she's getting the recognition she deserves. Her humanity in her characters and range is incredible. The effects were very cool, interesting characters, timing in the reactions was brilliant. Jamie Lee was amazing as well. Also Data is back! He was hilarious in this.

17 March 2023,Innovative and sometimes funny but not Oscar-worthy,"This is a polarising movie and it's easy to see why. The story of a stressed and unhappy Chinese laundry owner who gets sucked into parallel universes in order to save the world.

It's a mix of sci-fi, martial arts, slapstick and absurd, sometimes puerile comedy. The acting is very good but probably not worthy of Oscars for everyone ; Jamie-Lee Curtis is a standout. The direction is good but not as good as the other Best Director nominees. The script is amusing but shallow. It's certainly innovative and many will find it entertaining, which it is (mixed in with silliness).

My problem is that for a film to be truly great, it needs to generate strong emotions, invite contemplation and have substance. Simply telling a funny story is not enough. EEaaO is really just lightweight fairy floss. They shouldn't be giving Oscars for that, but then the Academy has lost it's way a bit lately. Films are getting the gong based on misplaced sentiment or hype, not on merit.",6
14 March 2023,It's an art film!,"It's hilarious watching the pro wrestling crowd lose their minds over an art film winning the Oscar. This is a Studio A24 production, which means limited appeal and high intellectual expectations for the audience. We saw the same indignation over A24's Moonlight, which was also a powerful and gritty exploration of the human condition.

Yeoh and Quan, deserved their awards. Their multiple character arcs in the multiverse were believable and heart wrenching. Not going to quibble about Curtis, but I certainly could.

This is a quirky film about love, and the many ways we express and fail to express it to each other. (For those who didn't ""get it"")

Production value is amazingly high for a $14 million budget. It's clearly a work of love with A-list actors taking less than their market value to be a part of the production.

If you enjoyed other A24 films in the past, don't hesitate to watch this one.",9
13 March 2023,i don't understand,"There was a time we had master pieces of sci-fi and story telling like the Matrix, for example, that weren't even nominated to the oscar of best picture. And now we have this messy convoluted story of a film winning everything everywhere at the same time. Can anyone make sense of this??

The quality of this film is at the same level as the matrix sequels, and that's the best i can put it, when i watched it i could never think this would get so much buzz. The bar is set very low this days i guess. It's one of those films you watch it one time and you're done with it.

I give it a 6 because it's not bad movie. Just an ok movie.

30 June 2023,I don't see the hype.,"It's not often I treat myself to a blu ray, based on the fact that this one seven Oscars, I ordered it, and have just finished watching it. That's ¬£22.99 that could have been spent on much better things.

..am I missing something, the credits rolled, the first thing I had to ask myself, what was that all about? I'm all for ambiguity and films, but I feel I should at least be in on the joke or story, I felt like an unwanted guest, on the outside, looking in, but the event was too self indulgent to allow for understanding.

The latter part of the film is more interesting and definitely better paced, I thought the early parts were way too sluggish, extra caffeine was definitely needed.

The visuals were ok, if a little too much at times, but the films strongest element had to be the acting, I must give credit to Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis.

Original, yes, well acted, most definitely, fathomable, that's the stumbling block.

The title definitely fits the film. I understand why people like it, I didn't care for it.

13 March 2023,"Nothing, nowhere, all at once","Very painful watch. I had to do it in three takes. Just pompous and grotesque: no backbone, erratic, superficial. If the intention was a tale about ordinary lives and multiverse dreams, it falls flat.

The accolades and the praises are shocking. The vacuum of this movie is impressive.

The musical theme during the credits is good. Except that, my rating is 0 all way through.

Characterization is between non-existing and clich√©. There is no multiverse alternative worlds in the film. It shows only trivial reality in various disguises. The artificial collage and the poor rendition of the concept deliver production of cold images. The film is not an immersing experience as probably was its ambition. Bad-Bad, to me. Maybe I am not alone to have watched it this way.

25 March 2022,Some of the most fun I've ever had while watching a movie.,"There's really something for just about everyone in this movie. It's part Kung-fu action, part absurdist comedy, part cerebral sci-fi, and part indie family drama. I think this is an instant classic that uses the art of cinema and movie-making to it's fullest potential.

They really throw everything AND the kitchen sink at the wall and somehow it all sticks and becomes a really fun and really special film that I would recommend to pretty much anyone.

Michelle Yeoh is fantastic as is the whole cast. The writing and direction is phenomenal and innovative and creative and it features of the best editing I've ever seen. It's a really wild movie, but if you sit back and absorb it, I think you'll have a good time.

13 March 2023,A very bravely action,"In the first days of the release of this movie, I praised and praised it on many critic and and analysis sites. I wrote that this movie is a giant masterpiece in the new millennium. I wrote that this film is like the paintings of Edvard Munch and ""Nicolas Poussin "", which have been made into the movie. And I said that mankind has not been able to create such a thing for centuries. And I also praised the perfect script. But after seeing a lot of negative comments, I became doubtful and some questions arose in my mind. Maybe I thought about the vagueness of Tan's story and changed my mind. When the movie won seven Oscars. I watched it for third time and asked myself, what is the definition of a smart story? If we want to logically create and define an intelligent story (I emphasize, logically), what should we do? And can social effects affect my poor understanding of modern art? In both cases, the answer was yes. And must be done in this way.

We adapt ourselves to life, boys. The last night Oscar action is not only very bravely but is so differentt actionin last twenty years. And is a very game changer act for the continues.....",10
23 January 2023,A unique experience,"There is so may ""what-ifs"" in life. So many questions. Evelyn Wang, the protagonist, is able to know the answer. Evelyn, a Chinese-American laundromat owner, discovers a lot of parallel universes---and within them---different versions of herself and her family.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is a comedy science fiction action film that is also bizarre and eccentric even. This film easily becomes one of my favorite movies I've ever seen.

The story deals with love, family, being lost, and a lot of things all at once. Michelle Yeoh is brilliant, relatable and funny as the main protagonist. Ke Huy Quan, who quit acting in 2002, returns in this movie as well, portraying Evelyn's klutzy and naive husband Waymond, and his acting is perfect as well. I am also impressed a lot with his action scenes, and most of the stunts were performed by him. Amazing. Stephanie Hsu is incredible playing Evelyn and Waymond's rebellious daughter. Jamie Lee Curtis also stars as an IRS agent, and she too is wonderful in this film. She, Michelle and Ke Huy Quan will surely be nominated for an Oscar, and it will be Jamie Lee's first nomination if ever.

The story will make you laugh, thrilled, cry and sometimes you will feel everything all at once. Yeah. The dialogues are also great, with a plenty of beautiful moments to offer. One of my favorite aspects are also the cinematography, editing and soundtrack. It was just done so well.

I wish someday, I can find someone who I'd love to do my laundry and taxes with.

Overall a beautiful movie, so i give it a 10.",10

I think i admired ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" (2022) more then i actually liked it at end this movie. I did like it, but i didn't love it because it was a bit to much for me. I won't go into spoilers or details, because this movie has to be seen to truly understand it. I liked how ingenuous it was, and i highly admired creators for creating such a piece of work. ""Everything..."" is truly an amazing movie and absolutely unique one, but maybe it was just a bit to much for my taste. But i highly recommend it anyway, this one is truly unique.

11 March 2023,There is always something to love,"A woman tries to do her taxes.

In order to keep from giving anything away, I will be vague. The creativity on display is immense. I thought that it would be overpowering and exhausting, but it actually manages an impressive focus, never losing us. It fits multiple genres and does them all well. To describe it, I would say it is an ADHD acid trip, emotionally engaging, funny, and displays a ton of emotional intelligence. I admire the lack of cynicism and exploration of nihilism. And no, I do not agree that this believes in the latter. Someone featured in it does. There's a difference. Every actor does an incredible job. I really hope this leads to way more work for the ageing cast, as it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt they still got it.

This features strong violence, sexual material and language. I recommend this to anyone that believes they might like it. 10/10.",10
17 July 2022,Decent movie but headache is unavoidable,"The movie is breathtaking. Every scene is like moving art and to top it off there are some amazing fight scenes too BUT the movie at times feels like a Bollywood movie. Even with those elements , I didn't mind it but the story is just not polished enough. There are at least 3-4 endings and it felt like the movie couldn't decide which final route to take.

The daughter in this movie is extremely annoying and doesn't know what she wants in life even though her mother already gave her everything.

I liked the movie but the ending didn't feel complete to me.

It could have been much smarter in delivery and in my honest opinion , the movie is overhyped but because of AMAZING Breathtaking visuals I will give it a steong 7.4/10.

13 March 2023,Bad overstretched failure of a film,"First let me start by saying that the acting is great, seriously, but it stops right there. The film on the other hand is the product of someone's random thoughts, badly edited, way over stretched scenes and ideas which repeat throughout the film over and over at random intervals. I have no problem with slow movies at all. I've seen ""Moon"", ""2001"", and many other ""slow"" movies, and I loved most of them. I love art in general, I love staring at great paintings, admiring sculptures, and reading a good book. This is not only a slow movie, but also one where every single idea is massaged over and over, and then massaged again, and when you think it is done being massaged, the director or editor massages it a few more times until you are so fed up with that idea and scene that you feel like leaving the theater. The movie is about love, care, and relationships, but other than that there is nothing deep or complex about the story. Alternate reality is not a new concept, yet the writer chooses to add too much complexity where it isn't needed, it makes the movie difficult to follow, especially due to the alternate reality / multiverses of the story.

While in the theater I heard many people laugh at some of the dumbest jokes, then I realized OK, this movie is targeted to an audience who enjoys these types of punch line jokes.

All in all I found this movie a complete disaster, hence the one start rating.",1
16 May 2023,It's not good at anything,"The fighting is clumsy shaky cam and has many cuts as the worst B movies from Hollywood. The actors are not that great (in this film). The story is beyond derivative, it's just a mix up of The One and Marvel's Multiverse. For no reason., they added some made-up goofy environment and side characters. And some progressive issues to make it Hollywood approved.

It's quite telling of the times this hot piece of garbage got so many awards and managed to trick a lot of people to go and watch it. It's not entertaining, it's not funny, it's not good action, it's not original.

I started it with low expectations but even those were shattered within the first 20 minutes.

How did they pick this over Top Gun Maverick, an imperfect movie but in another level at every category compared to this. Or The Whale, a simple movie with great acting and direction?

How is this best film editing, for example.

I like Yeoh and Curtis, but this is far from their best.",
9 April 2022,Everything Everywhere All at Once Review,"A Chinese woman living her worst life is swept up into a interdimensional catastrophe where she alone can save the universe.

This film is incredible and I cannot believe the Daniels were able to pull off this crazy story. This film combines a number of different themes and genres and somehow makes it work.

You get some extremely good martial arts action along side some raunchy comedy and the two make for an extremely entertaining film. That combined with a complex multiverse story and a family dynamic intertwined makes for an incredible film.

The pacing of this is very quick and you do not feel like you've been there for 2 plus hours. It moves quickly but allows you to get to know the characters and develops them very nicely.

Michelle Yeoh is phenomenal as the lead character Evelyn, Oscar worthy. She is moved from being funny to being an action hero to being this extremely emotional character so flawlessly and it's amazing to see.

Stephanie Hsu is also extremely good in this film. The rest of the cast is also across the board outstanding. Ke Huy Quan, James Hong, Jamie Lee Curtis all give great performances in their respective roles.

In terms of gripes, there are times where too much is going on and it's hard to follow and as a result certain aspects are lost. But it doesn't happen overly often. Also this film can be over the top at times in terms of raunchy comedy. This didn't bother me but I can see others being disturbed.

Overall this film is incredibly well done. Their ability to combine a number of different genres and make it flow so well is something I've never seen before.

17 May 2022,EEAAO is outstanding - you must see it if you get the opportunity!,"A truly sensational film! The utter definition of a must-watch.

'Everything Everywhere All at Once' is impressive from every single viewpoint. I had heard murmurs of it being a great film, yet it still managed to completely smash my expectations. This 2022 release features a superb cast, a fascinating story and some top notch visuals. The editing and pacing, in particular, are brilliant.

The onscreen talent are all fantastic, but Michelle Yeoh is still the absolute standout from this. What a performance! I could watch her in this role over and over and over. With that said, Ke Huy Quan (welcome back!) is awesome as well, as are Stephanie Hsu, James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis. Everyone plays their part very, very well.

All of the humour lands, with some parts being truly funny. It also manages to show supremely enjoyable action alongside a highly meaningful side too. In short: EEAAO is outstanding - you must see it if you get the opportunity!

15 April 2022,Unlike Anything I've Ever Experienced Before,"What a piece of art this was. I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say this film made me laugh, cry and go ""wtf?...sometimes all at once. It was an incredibly original vision that seems to have had incredible care and quality put into it by everyone and was just such a unique experience. I would recommend it to anyone to give it a shot.

22 February 2023,"Hotdog Fingers, So Creepy And Funny","A simply stunning creative masterpiece.

This movie is so well written and acted, the lengthy-ish running time whizzes by in a flash of hotdog fingers and racoons.

I spent much of the time watching the show wondering who I thought was the best supporting actor, the Dr Jones kid of Jaime Lee Curtis and at the end I still couldn't decide.

Best of luck to the judges of the Oscars on this one. Incredible entertainment, funny, great action and enough dildos to fill a um, thing.

An instant cinematic classic that will help drive people back to the movies.

Don't miss this remarkable piece of movie history :)",10
8 April 2023,Did an AI bot write the script?,"A seemingly purposeful mess of nonsense. Nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. I wanted to enjoy this but it was contrived, left no meaning apart from 'there's this concept of a multiverse' and we should appreciate what we have in life. Big and good concepts, but there's a detachment in how the story is told. Just too chaotic to create something you can latch on to, so it becomes unintentionally superficial. On the upside the acting is great, with well deserved gongs for the leads. Why do I have write six hundred characters for one of these reviews? I've made my points concisely without switching people off with a case of TLDR.

30 March 2022,Three Thoughts,"1. After being riveted by a brief shot of Michelle Yeoh watching laundry tumble in the dryer, I now believe I actually would watch her do literally anything.

2. I cannot imagine what possessed Jamie Lee Curtis to take on this film, but I am soooo glad she did!

3. This film is crazy, crazy fun!

16 February 2023,Marvel style humour. Boring and repetitive.,"""All in Everywhere at the Same Time"" is a well-acted, well-directed film with very good sound editing and mixing, however, I don't like its marvel-like humor, its criticism seems hollow, its slapstick style is unconvincing and its editing is tiring, the good editing of the film is lost when you use it to excess, and that happens with all the good aspects, after an hour and a half, everything stops working and at a certain point I just disconnected from the work, I thought about everything , except for the movie there in front of me, I don't understand how hype it is and the theaters are so full, it's the same audience that stays in queues for hours to see ""ant-man"" or any canned food of that kind, and at the end ""All in All Place at the Same Time"" is a gourmet canned food with good ideas that gradually self-destruct, leaving a giant shell of scraps behind. I like the universe created and I like the performances, but all this doesn't hold back the great tangle of ""nothing"" that we have here, in which even its great differential, the ""humor"" is weak, its Oscar competitor, ""Inisherin's Banshees"" it is a film with a humor that is also present but of an infinitely superior quality and tune. Note 7/10.",7
12 April 2022,This Movie Answers the Question of What Would Happen if You Put EVERYTHING on a Bagel,"This film is easily one of the greatest ever made. I laughed, I cried, I had an existential crisis. A perfect movie. Couldn't ask for more. This movie deserves all the praise it gets, and certainly deserves more.

25 May 2022,"Like modern monty python, without the great humour","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",6
7 February 2023,2 hours of nonsense,"The movie starts (20-30 minutes) ""fine"", quite annoying with MCU type quips and jokes that almost destroy the exposition destined to explain the main character and her circumstances (and a bit the secondary characters), but good enough to get us interested in the premise.

After that though, it quickly becomes non-stop nonsense, movie references, and repetetive action sequences full of ""quirky"" ""jokes""/""gags"" that were only embarrasing, if anything.

The plot and characters are so simple, we (me and my cousin) guessed what the movie was going to say and how it was going to end after15 minutes. Also the tonal disnonance between raunchy humor and ""old school"" sentimentality was jarring.

In the end, even Disney movies were/are more sophisticated in their way to tell this type of ""feel good"" stories.",1
13 June 2022,"Great idea, but this one is not for me","The movie is okay. I get the message. I like the creativity and some dialogues, but in my opinion, it's overhyped. For some it might be confusing, dizzy and unbearable to watch, even to me, I couldn't stand some parts, and I have a very high tolerance towards this type of films. I know the point is to overwhelm and have some funny, ridiculous scenes from all the nihilistic, madness and existentialist plot, but it's not my stuff.

4 May 2022,I feel my soul blossoming,"I have never felt this way after a movie that I feel now. I left the theater delirious, feeling drunk almost. I laughed. I cried. I felt despair, and hope, and everything all at the same time. I made it home just in time for me to bawl again and then laugh. This movie is a masterpiece of cinema, and a masterpiece of life. Run, don't walk, to see this movie.

Michelle Yeoh shined all the way through the end and I'd say, it's Michelle Yeoh in the multiverse of madness!!!

7 January 2023,An oddly poignant goofball masterpiece (2022 list excerpt),"There is too much to say about Everything Everywhere All At Once to neatly summarize it here -- and there's a good chance you've already heard everyone else go over it anyway. I've seen people call this their new favorite film of all time, and while I'm not prepared to go that far (almost out of protest, since the film has amassed a weirdly touchy fanbase), I can see why this has moved a great many people:

The way that its relentlessly zany multiverse-hopping actually has thought behind it and stays largely consistent. The way it takes cues from the Wachowskis, Wong-Kar Wai, Douglas Adams, and even Pixar while still feeling original. The way it makes us teary-eyed at even the goofiest sights. The way that its initial craziness -- its full understanding of the fact that an infinite multiverse brings infinite possibilities of comedy and action (take notes, Marvel) -- eventually leads to oddly poignant musings on purpose, meaning, and the futility of worrying over what one's life could've been; in harping on the paths one could've taken, at the expense of what's already there; of endlessly pondering what power we have in the great cosmic comedy that might already have its ending planned when all you really should be focusing on is holding someone's hand (whether or not you inhabit a universe where everyone has sausage fingers).

It's not that we're all ""small and stupid"" and that life is pointless in the grand scheme; it's that the point of life may as well be a simple one.

And really, I think something similar can be said of the way that people connected with this film. For all the nifty things about it and all its ""grand"" ambitions, it's ultimately just a sweet movie about family; about love. Plain and simple.

The mother-daughter dynamic at the center isn't new, but it's rare to see it mainly from the mother's perspective. She's played excellently by Michelle Yeoh, who is backed by a hilarious Jamie Lee Curtis, a cute-yet-menacing Stephanie Hsu, a similarly multifaceted Ke Huy Quan, and of course, the utterly legendary James Hong, still on fire at nearly 100.

I'd say ""go see it"" but you probably already have.",9
21 May 2022,Multificent!,"I laughed, I cried; I peed myself but couldn't access the multiverse. There seems to be a massive disclosure going on. Everywhere I look there are info drops about time ravel, other dimensions and truths that have always been there but kept hidden. Glad this was made...

It all makes sense now...

29 March 2023,"Great acting, mediocre puzzling story","I can see why there may have been oscars given out for best and supporting actors, but this is not a great or memorable film. I found it incredibly puzzling and stressful to watch. At the core of it is an exploration of the relationship between a migrant woman and her daughter. And also the breakdown of her marriage. She steps in and out of alternate realities that ends up frustrating and confusing the viewer rather than achieving its goal of entertainment. It's a flurry of impressive visuals and film editing without substance in my opinion. I don't know how this film got the hype it did at the Oscars, but that's the mysterious world of Hollywood for you. In any event, you could take this film or leave it.

10 July 2022,Certainty unique,"Definitely a unique film. After watching hundreds of movies, I met Everything Everywhere All at Once through my girlfriend.

I've never seen anything like it, it's okay that he inspires in other works like, Inception, Butterfly Effect, Matrix, Rick and Morty (Interdimensional TV), 2001 - A Space Odyssey, and still manages to maintain its originality.

The film is divided into two parts, the first funniest part manages to amuse the viewer very well in the face of the oddities that it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The second, deeper, makes us reflect on what really matters and what our role is in the world.

The plot is out of the ordinary as the title suggests, and the photography, clothing, makeup, performances and soundtrack correspond to the film's proposal.

A film with all certainty unique and that was born classic.",8
13 March 2023,Didn't deserve so much spotlight,"It was the only movie I watched in a theater this year and I clearly didn't get the hype.

I didn't expect anything, I didn't know what the movie was about. But the trailer was very appealing and I liked this idea of almighty.

I heard a lot of people say it was one of the best movies and it's absolutely not the case. I rated this movie 6/10 because the acting and the special effects were very good but the script was a disaster, my rating is also not lower because I really think it could have been a great movie but it stayed on an easy path and was quite pretentious. And the movie was boring, I was always checking the time it was. It was a repetition of messy situations.

30 May 2022,A Gift,"Eat your heart out, Kevin Feige; as much as I've enjoyed the latest MCU ventures (because I'm basic), I much prefer Michelle Yeoh & the Multiverse of Madness. It's the psychedelic sincerity of The Beatles ""All You Need Is Love"" in the form of a cinematic kaleidoscope of colors. Every single element is flawless: script, direction, action, humor, performances, romance, science fiction, heart. It utilizes filmmaking economics with such brilliance you could miss it behind the smorgasbord of fun on the surface.

15 April 2022,Exactly what you expect from the title,"If the Oscars ever decide to present an award for 'Most Apt Title to a Movie', this film 100% gets my vote for being the first laureate. When you look up the definition of the word ""maximalist"" in the Oxford dictionary, the poster for this movie should be the first thing you see. At its core, Everything Everywhere All at Once has a rather familiar premise, where our female protagonist suddenly finds out in her everyday life that she lives within a multiverse and has the power to prevent the destruction of everything as we know them. What makes this movie stands out from its peers is the mind-boggling commitment of the filmmakers to really show the viewers what an infinite number of universes looks, sounds, and feels like from the perspective of a character caught in their wake.

I am honestly very conflicted about this movie. On one hand I am in absolute awe of what this movie was able to achieve in terms of raw impact on the viewers through an all-out sensory assault. It is without a doubt one of the most visually-daring and creative films I've seen in quite a while, with an endless number of insane action sequences flowing from one scene to the next. The story really goes to the max with using the multiverse context to pull off every joke you can and can't think of, frequently conjuring up tens of different skits within a single minute. On another note, something I really appreciated is that underneath all the dizzying spectacles there is also a very heartfelt and touching story about family and living for kindness.

Where the movie gets exhausting for me is from its shear overbearingness of its presentation through the majority of the runtime, which I fully acknowledge is the point and that many others won't feel is a problem. I did thoroughly enjoy the frantic style for the first hour, but after that the relentless attack does start to wear out its welcome and feel a bit repetitive. Some of the jokes also didn't land that well for me, which relate back to the presentation style whereby random bizarre things happen almost nonsensically one after the other due to the presence of the multiverse, making them feel like watching YouTube compilations of meme clips - funny for a while but starts to grate after that. I enjoyed the movie more towards the final act where it focused back on the characters and their relationships, so I personally would've preferred the movie to have struck a bit more balance on developing that aspect with the visual extravaganza exhibition.

To summarise, Everything Everywhere All at Once fully delivers on the potential of its title by giving an acid-trip-esque experience that is designed to mystify and overwhelm the viewers in what might well be the craziest multiverse movie in any timeline or universe. I always appreciate when the filmmakers have the guts and bravado to stick and execute their vision without compromise, and by golly if Daniels did not do just that. As a final note, I have to give a shout-out to A24 again: not all of their movies fully work for me, but you can count on them to be unique and to leave a lasting impact.",7
21 March 2023,Everything is nonsense about this movie.SKIP. OVER RATED.,"Everything is nonsense about this movie. SKIP. OVER RATED.

I couldn't take it after 1 hour. It feels like a bad cartoon and even though there are good actors (the only reason I lasted 1 hour) I gave up.

Not once I laughed. I am not sure what it is supposed to be... A failed fun intellectual movie? TBH I don't care.

Difficult to believe it won so many Oscars. Maybe for the actors. But best film??? I can't believe it didn't go to Elvis.

It is too bad that IMDB has changed its poclicy about reviewing and now we have to write a minimum of 600 characters. This movie doesn't deserve more than a few: SKIP OVER RATED and BAD.",1
10 April 2022,Holy Bagel,"Don't ask. Go and see it, because you've never seen a movie quite like this one. It is a fantasy/comedy, but at times that is reversed. I will now make an attempt at a review.

The middle-aged owner of a failing Chinese laundry is being audited by the IRS, her lesbian daughter brings her 'friend' home for a visit, her infantile husband is of marginal help and her father is senile. On a visit to the IRS her husband reveals himself as an alien who can show her how marvelous her life would have been in other galaxies, to which he gives her access.

Sound confusing? Just go and see it. It is extremely entertaining, and I'm going to see it again to fill in the considerable number of incoherent spots I still have. Oscar noms for Best Actress (are they still called that?) Michelle Yeoh and for Editing and Special Effects.

P. S. The hole in the bagel represents the way to inner peace. (Don't ask).

She must battle a supreme villain, Jobu Tupaki who is also her own daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu). The IRS agent Deirdre Beaubeirdra (Jamie Lee Curtis) is also Dybbuked by a murderous acolyte of Jobu. Great fun as alternate Evelyns possess her body and use their skills to fight back. There is even a universe where everybody has hotdogs instesd of fingers and this segment has a great pastiche of apemen discovering weapons from 2001: A Space Odyssey. There is also a film within a film, actually it's kind of this film, watch by it's star another Evelyn. The traverse of the Multiverse occasionally brings the Marvel TV series Legion to mind, both in production design and charcter traits. Essentially it's a story about the search for meaning, understanding and love. Great performances by Yeoh, Hsu, Curtis, Quan along with James Hong as her father.

22 May 2022,"""I love you""","I've wanted to watch this for some time now, and was not disappointed.

It's chaotic, VERY creative and more importantly.. it delivers on an emotional level, with a message that should reverberate with anyone, out of shared pain, experiences and a desire for something better.

For me, just like it's title, it has a little bit of everything. It might have been predictable in some developments, unrealistic in others (even with the weird rules it sets for itself, but for obviously-fabricated-memorable-moments) and a few lows and slow-paced scenes. But it doesn't matter, because execution is everything! I was entertained, touched and excited as well. It does things we expect and but it also delivers something you probably have only ever imagined. And it works very well. Specially the way it ends the conflict it started, and how it all feels very human.

I also quite enjoyed the superb sound editing!

Easy recommendation for anyone interested in having a small journey. One that might leave you exactly where you started, but with a small smile that might spark something unexpected. I don't know.",8

Immaculate writing and a superlative fusion of multiple genres make this an out of a world experience. Drop everything, take a deep breathe and cherish this phenomenal film.

When we deal with the multiverse, it is bound to be complicated, but with vivid and colorful cinematography this one explains it more beautifully. You get action, romance, family drama, science fiction, and fantasy all coming in one. The Ratatouille reference was pleasantly done. Superlative performances from Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Ke Huy Quan and that heart-touching climax is worth your time.

2 January 2023,Entertaining but completely overrated,"First things first: it's a good movie. I enjoyed watching it. It had mostly good acting, it was funny, most fight scenes were hilarious.

But at the same time it's too long, drawn out badly paced, repetitive and sometimes frustrating to watch. The ending could have been done in 10 minutes instead of like 30 minutes without losing anything storywise.

The over the top praise this movie gets is a thing I don't really understand to be honest. Maybe it's a sign of the times, showing how bad cinema has become, when a good but also quite flawed movie like this gets so much attention.

Nonetheless I'd recommend watching it, as it is refreshingly different to the crap that comes out of Hollywood. Also it's mostly free of clich√©s that make most modern movies so unwatchable

In summary: entertaining and funny but not even close to being the best movie ever, as some claim.",8

14 March 2023,A beautiful exploration of nihilism vs existentialism,"On the surface, ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is an absurd action-filled comedy about an immigrant family that discovers their ability to travel across dimensions.

Underneath the surface, it's a deeply philospohical film exploring the themes of nihilism and existentialism, and the core meaning of life.

Through its blend of surrealism and comedy, the film manages to make these philosophical questions accessible and engaging, inviting audiences to join the main character on her journey of self-discovery.

This is one of the most beautiful movies and stories I've seen, and it's one to be watched and rewatched, and it deserves every award it has received.

--

If you watch this film and don't get it, I'd recommend watching one of the videos on YouTube that talks about the philosophy and/or symbolism of Everything Everywhere All At Once. If you still don't like it, that's fine, not everyone likes the same thing.",10

2 August 2022,"We go in a circle, do laundry, do income taxes, do laundry ... is that all there is?","Besides anything else this is a very manic movie. It plays on the (certainly fictional) concept that there are an infinite number of parallel universes and each of us exists in each of those, with particular traits and skills. We witness each character exploring a number of their alternate existences. Distilled down it is about finding your true self and building loving relationships with others. My wife and I stared watching it, she gave up after just 10 or 12 minutes, too off-kilter and manic for her. I watched all of it but in three different sittings.

The focus is on Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Wang. Over 20 years earlier she starred in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and here she gets to use some of her martial arts skills. While I admire what the filmmakers did here, for ME it would never become one of my favorites, to re-watch periodically. Too manic and off-kilter and too many symbolic elements to make sense of.

This comment by a reviewer reflects my own take:

'Though I usually like high-concept creative films, this time I must admit I felt lost in all its odd layers of storytelling and couldn't emotionally get with such an incoherent film that just kept piling on absurdly illogical sci-fi things to its base plot until I ultimately had enough.'

10 April 2022,You won't see a more original film this year!,"This film is so creative! It's really a film about family and love, but told in a way I've never seen. It has so much heart that it'll have you grinning and tears in your eyes all at same time. All the performances are fantastic. You can tell all the actors are having so much fun. Michelle Yeoh can definitely carry a film. She's was great. It was great to see Ke Huy Quan back in a film again. He does a lot of heavy lifting in this one and honestly deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Jamie Lee Curtis literally lets it all hang out, and you can tell she's having more fun in this movie than any of the new Halloween films. The only negative thing I can say about this film is there is an image that is blurred unnecessarily. I highly recommend this film and hope it's remembered in awards season.

20 January 2023,How a multiverse should be done,"This spectacular, bonkers, incredibly original, laugh out loud and incredibly moving film puts all other attempts at a multiverse to shame. And most other films for that matter.

It is so utterly unique that it is hard to compare it with anything that has gone before it.

That it was even made gives us all hope that, amongst all the regurgitated clones, lazy and unoriginal films that are made each year, a true diamond can still be found in the rough.

Everything about this film is nearly flawless. The script is one of the heros. It's tight, hilariously funny, moving, ribald (don't let kids watch it!) And, despite the utterly chaotic nature of the film, still flows and manages to keep the viewer informed enough to abandon it for being to hard to follow, which is no mean feat.

Yeoh is incredible in everyday. She shows the full range of her talents, which are broad indeed.

The rest of the main cast are superb and the casting team should be commended.

The action is, as you'd expect, it brilliant and varies enough not be become repetitive, a perennial problem with many martial arts movies.

The score is great, as is the direction and editing, which, once you've seen the film would have been a tough gig indeed.

Ive just watched it a second time and enjoyed it even more as there is so much going on, it's hard to take it all in on first viewing.

Let's hope more original films now get a chance at life. God knows, we need the..",10
13 March 2023,mind blown,"I was resistant to watching this movie at first, because I'd seen the directors' previous, awful Swiss Army Man. But the buzz was so strong that I finally broke down and watched it. And it is crazy and exciting and touching and like nothing else.

The movie throws out ideas like the world is ending in five minutes and all the ideas need to be used before it does. The story goes everywhere and I dare you to predict anything.

The cast is great. The biggest surprise is Ke Huy Quan, because when I saw him I was like, ""this guy is amazing, how have I never seen him before?"" and it turns out he was the kid actor from Temple of Doom and his career had petered out years before. Which is tragic, but hopefully he gets to make a bunch of movies after winning the Oscar.

Also great performances from Michelle Yeoh (as always), and really, everyone.

If you like movies that keep you on your toes and mess with your head, you should definitely watch this. It's so much fun.",8
24 April 2022,Stunned,"I'm 68 years old and have seen a lot of films in my time. There have been only a few times when I've left the theater in something of a state of awe for what I've seen. This was one of those times. It is a psychedelic rollercoaster, a Kung Fu flick, a love story, a family story, an immigrant saga and a comedy all wrapped up in quantum physics. It is also surprisingly moving at times and the ultimate message of the film is sorely needed today. I really can't praise it highly enough though I know it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. Michelle Yeoh was simply amazing.

10 May 2022,INSANE CINEMA!üò≥üçøüé•,"ITS CERTAINLY A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE!

What I Liked -

1. It's a Completely Insane Cinematic Experience.

2. The Rock Scene

3. The Fights are Good.

4. The Comedy for the very most part landed well with the Audience I was with. There were I would say close to a dozen Belly Laughs throughout.

5. The way they tie Everything in and out of eachother throughout the movie, was in my opinion done very well.

Critism -

1. Its Too long. Multiple Times i thought it ended.

2. The Movie Does Exhaust you by the End of it.

Overall, It was an Insane Experience but ONLY a one off Watch.",7
2 July 2022,"Utterly Unique, Endlessly Creative, Effortlessly Funny and Surprisingly Deeply Emotive.","I have been fascinated for years by the concept of the multiverse as a narrative device, in the past roughly four years, mostly, I think, because of Sony's stupendous 'Into the Spider-Verse', and probably Adult Swim's 'Rick and Morty' multiverses seem to be everywhere, largely in Marvel and DC's respective universes, but, thanks to the Daniels, we've got an entirely new take on how the idea of a multiverse can be used in media. I hadn't, and still haven't seen the Daniels' previous film 'Swiss Army Men', but the abundance of praise this film was receiving is what made me so excited to see it, reading some of the reviews I knew that, at the very least, I'd like it, but, in all honestly I wasn't expecting to love it as much I did; I had heard of the film's creativity and overall just unique feel, but I still don't think I was fully prepared for the madness that awaited me. The story, in its most simplistic description, focuses on a Chinese woman named Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) trying to do her taxes, and this very simplistic premise, which, by the way, does spin off into an utterly chaotic multiverse plot, is one of the film's greatest strengths, as, despite all of the hyperactivity and action, the plot isn't overstuffed, its very simplistic premises allows its more symbolic elements and emotional beats to flourish more freely, and, in turn, be more impactful. The film's humour was the thing I was worried about the most, as I am very specific, or, more honestly, very picky, when it comes comedy, the bizarre, in-your-face nature of the comedy in the film, as showcased in the trailer, anyway, can work for me, but typically, I prefer more low-key comedy. However, the comedy here surprised me by being both utterly bizarre yet, surprisingly the film's dialogue has a very sarcastic vibe to it, the film manages to combine to styles of very different types of humour to create a completely new and unique comedic experience. The performances are probably some of my favourites since 'Parasite', everyone brings their A-game, though, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Qaun particularly stunned me. However, all of the stuff mentioned above wouldn't have mattered if it weren't for the Daniels' phenomenal direction (and writing, though I did already cover that) as well as the truly sensational editing by Paul Rogers, which brought the film together so well.

'Everything Everywhere' is such a unique and special film, that already feels like a classic, and a testament to what filmmaking can be and do.",9
22 October 2022,Kill Bill and Inception Make a Beautiful but Stupid Love Child.,"The genre is hard to define. Think Kill Bill meets Inception, but silly. It attempts to meld comedy, mind-bending sci-fi, and action into one, which it does to an extent, but fails to make it more than a sum of its parts. It was a great idea with an arguably poor execution.

A slow-burning first half turns into a fast, colourful, adventure sailing through the multiverse. It's a visually impressive piece that pounds the senses and ends with a wave of feel-good fun. Everything Everywhere All at Once oozes originality and creates a new mind-bending world in which to immerse yourself.

Yet, originality alone cannot carry this film. The jokes did not always land. The script was so simplistic it sometimes felt like it was directed towards children - something belied by the unnecessarily sexual nature of many scenes. Possibly the worst issue is the many plot holes. In a modern world where anything is possible, the choice of martial arts as the main medium of warfare is unexplained.

To use an analogy from the film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is like a clay pot that holds your attention in the moment, but is so full of cracks that it fragments the moment you start to reflect any deeper.",6
21 May 2022,Michelle Yeoh in the Multiverse of Madness,"Why take drugs when you can experience whatever fever dream this film was?

Truly one of the most bonkers and most creative movies I've ever seen! Phenomenal performances, great characters, an engaging story, an amazing soundtrack, stunning visuals, cool action sequences, and genuinely funny moments while exploring deep themes and having a touching message that will no doubt resonate with audiences.

If you don't watch this movie then you are committing a crime! One of the best experiences of 2022.

27 March 2022,"Extremely weird, but fun","If the Jet Li movie The One was written by Monty Python you'd get a film very much like this.

It's pretty fun, even if the character development is sporadic rather than occurring over time which can be a bit jarring, but over all its pretty entertaining.

28 February 2023,Couldn't Finish It,"I watched, or at least tried to watch, this movie after reading about all of the SAG awards it received and all of the Academy Award buzz. Big mistake. Right off the bat the dialog was unintelligible. The Chinese parts with subtitles was the easiest for me to follow but the rest was a mess. Because I couldn't understand half of what was being said that made the plot almost impossible to follow. I made it most of the way through all of the action in the IRS building when the daughter and her pig showed up then it just got to be too much. I decided that I had wasted enough of my time and gave up on it. All it did was remind me of what a waste of time it is to listen to anything the SAG or Academy Award people have to say.

8 May 2022,Easily the best movie I've seen in theatres in decades.,"This movie is so good it's mind blowing. At a time when every other movie is a formulaic super hero blockbuster that, while entertaining in their own right, often have literally nothing valuable to say, Everything Everywhere All at Once shows us that we can have great action blockbusters that also have something to say about life, love, happiness, and our own infinite regrets.

As much as I loved this movie though, it should be said it definitely will not appeal to everyone as I witnessed several people walk out of the theatre when I saw it. I can only imagine why they left, but looking at some of the negative reviews here my guess is it was either because they felt offended by something in the movie, or because they just did not understand it. That's unfortunate, because they're truly depriving themselves of one of the best movies in recent years, if not all time.

2 July 2022,I liked it but...,"I like sci-fi, I like silly, I like action, I like funny. Sometimes you put it all together and I love it, like the movie Scott Pilgrim. In this case though I don't think they did it quite right, like they did too much, tried too hard. So at the end of the day, the cast does a great job and it's visually very engaging, and overall quite entertaining. But it does feel a bit messy without much of a point. I'd give it a 6.5 if it was an option.

9 April 2022,Multiverse of OMG!!!!,"Liked: Everything! Not one second was wasted in this movie.

Not so much: Started off a little slow but that was pretty much it.

Loved: Michelle Yeoh! She def needs a nomination for this role(s).

This movie was absolutely stunning! Started off a little slow while the foundation of this movie was being placed but once it took off damn did it ever! I was totally not ready for this movie. The trailers feature a little of what it is all about but till you actually sit through the whole thing will it actually get across that this movie is more than the flashy sci-fi action flick that is being advertised. Great Flick!

26 January 2023,Migraine central,"This is a frenetic, bombastic visual spectacle that will either leave you flabbergasted, overwhelmed, confused or nauseated ; or possibly a combination of these feelings.

At the heart of the film there seems to be a heartfelt message. However the journey to get there takes you on a acid fuelled wild ride full of hotdog fingers, rubber phalluses, bum-bag nunchakus and racoonouille.

In turn this fast-paced vomit-inducing journey detracts from the overarching conclusion leaving you overwhelmed with everything you've just witnessed.

There were certainly parts which were hilariously ridiculous, filled with adrenaline fuelled action and emotionally deep but my overall feeling at the end was just exhaustion.

They tried too much, everywhere, all at once.",6

29 May 2023,Everything+Everwhere+AllAtOnce = A Mess,"I was so pleased when Michelle Yeoh won the Oscar. Something that should have happened with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I am so disappointed it was for this film. Whereas there are many good elements, ideas, characters in this film as well as a highly skilled production; the film is akin to making a stew of a variety of leftovers that turns out to be unpalatable to more discriminating tastes. The Banshees of Inisherin really deserved Best Picture , not this. A comparison between the two films would be like placing great art next to a cartoon. Both have their places but not in the same room. With that being said, I give this film a solid 6 which for me means it's good but not something I care to endure again.

The acting was good, but the storyline is so weird. It's a very weird and quirky movie and it's not for everyone. This movie is overhyped and I certainly don't understand why the actors in this movie have received awards. They acted okay but was it price worthy? No. They should have received awards for other projects they have done but not for this overhyped mediocre movie. It isn't that good of a movie the media want you to believe. I honestly think I wasted my time watching this movie. It was a letdown. Don't recommend watching it. This movie is a failure.

17 April 2022,I Left the Theater Speechless in the Best Possible Way,"A Chinese-American woman is struggling in nearly every aspect of her life. She is in the process of getting divorced from her husband, her laundry business is struggling, she has distant relationships with her family including her own daughter and she is being audited by the IRS. On the day she and her family go to a meeting with an IRS inspector, her husband's mind gets taken over by someone from the Alpha Universe. Evelyn Wang learns that she needs to connect with different versions of herself in different timelines. This is because there is an evil entity named Jobu Tupaki that is seemingly trying to destroy the different universes. In the parallel universes, Evelyn learns different skills to fend off against her enemies which seem similar to her hobbies.

Going into Everything Everywhere All at Once, I was pretty excited for it, but also a little worried that it might be overhyped due to the sheer acclaim it received over the past few weeks. Just from the trailer alone, this looked unique and stunning. It looked like the type of movie that I dream of seeing in theaters. Original, action-packed, creative and funny. I prepared myself for a movie with a bonkers story... and yet it still manages to stun me.

I do not think there has ever been a movie that I have watched in a theater that left me speechless the way Everything Everywhere All at Once did. I don't think I have seen a movie as creative and original as this... ever, at least as far as brand new movies go. EEAaO takes its already insane premise and goes as deep as possible with it exploring different possibilities a single person could live, how it can all go wrong for them in seconds and how when a person decides to go rogue and stop caring, it affects the people they are around. Watching this movie made me think of all of the possibilities I could have had and what decisions I made led me to where I am today. That was one of the biggest takeaways I had from the story and the script does a wonderful job exploring this insane premise to its fullest.

But of course, you cannot have a story like this and not have humor. This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. The jokes in this film had me cracking up like crazy. It can go from physical comedy to more subtle things like references and situational comedic moments such as making fun of the chosen one trope or how Evelyn's world keeps going from the Alpha Universe to her normal universe. That leads to some hilarious moments of physical comedy. For me though, the funniest scene in the entire film is a specific fight with Jobu Tupaki against a few of the security guards. That scene made my mouth drop like no other scene did. I could not believe the utter nonsense I was watching and I loved every minute of it. This movie is comedy gold as it is not afraid to push the boundaries at all.

Despite the wacky nature of the script, the movie does not lose its way of the sad and touching moments such as Evelyn's relationships with her family and spouse both in this universe, and in the parallel universes. This leads to me Evelyn herself. Despite Evelyn's rude attitude and unpleasant nature, you cannot help but feel bad for her during this film. She is shown how successful she could have been, she seems to get frustrated about everything and everyone and she her relationships with her family are distant at best and disastrous at worst. However, you can still she has a caring and loving side and her experience through the multiverse shows her this side of her. In fact, the multiverse shows several different sides of Evelyn! She uses them in combat to go from being a confused and scared woman to being just as strong as Alpha Waymond. This makes Evelyn a very intriguing and flawed protagonist that I enjoyed watching develop.

Michelle Yeoh is terrific as Evelyn Wang. Every single expression, emotion and line of dialogue she delivers are all on point. Yeoh captures the fear, confusion and fright a woman who is exploring alternate timelines of herself has while fighting against people controlled by others in the multiverse trying to kill her. I'm not too familiar with Yeoh's filmography, but this movie makes me want to see more of her films. Then there is Ke Huy Quan as Evelyn's husband, Waymond. This man has so much diversity in this role from a bumbling, but kindhearted family man who is struggling just as much as Evelyn is to a badass agent from the Alpha Universe. He is perfect in both roles and he is a great action star too. However, the scenes where he is Evelyn's husband work beautifully because of his sincerity and sweetness in the role. Quan shows how diverse he is with this role as the same man with two vastly different personalities.

The rest of the performances are great too like James Hong showing great comedic chops as Evelyn's father while showing some hidden depths to that character, Jenny Slate as a bratty customer and Stephanie Hsu as Evelyn's daughter Joy and as the villain Jobu Tupaki. Just like Evelyn, Tupaki had some depth to her actions. Hsu captures the creepy vibe from her character as well as those depths that are explored. Jamie Lee Curtis as the IRS agent also manages to give a performance that shows a soft spot to her seemingly cold hearted nature which makes her shine. Finally, Harry Shum Jr. Cracked me up in his role in the movie, but I don't want to spoil it. All in all, this is a fantastic cast.

There are even some martial arts fight scenes and they are a blast to watch. I love the editing techniques used in them. They make the fights energetic and fast paced without making them confusing and shaky. Each fight had me smiling because they involved wacky antics as well making them all feel different from each other. The cinematography is beautiful as well with many shots reflecting the situation Evelyn is in with her different dimensions as well as her fractured relationships. The sound design is what really shines though. This movie sounds amazing with how it sets up the tone of the film and how it portrays the fighting sequences as fun, but brutal. The soundtrack is awesome as well with a beautiful musical score and some great vocal tracks as well.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is not only easily the best movie I have seen this year so far, but it is my favorite movie that I have seen in theaters in years. In a world where there are so many franchise films and remakes and reboots, this is the type of film I love seeing come out. It has so much to say about decisions, love, hatred and family while being hilarious, awesome and original at the same time. While I think some people may be turned off by some of the trippiness of the movie and visuals, I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see a great original film. Seriously, if you have plans to go to the movies soon, this is a must watch. I don't think I will ever see another film like Everything Everywhere All at Once.",10
2 July 2022,"Multiverse, without Marvel Superheroes","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",10
7 April 2022,A Fun Romp into the Multiverse,"I recently had the opportunity to view this movie, and I'm certainly glad I did. It's a decidedly unique take on the genre of science fiction/action/adventure. The acting is top notch, especially Michelle Yeoh's portrayal of the protagonist, Evelyn. It's bizarre, funny, smart, sweet and a whole lot of fun that will maintain your attention from start to finish. Is the film's message particularly deep or profound? No. Is it one of the greatest movies I've ever seen? No. But it's a wild ride that ought not to be missed for its uniqueness. Edit: As of 4/28/2022, this movie has landed on IMDB's Top 250 list, the only 2022 film thus far to reach this remarkable milestone. As of this edit, the movie is at #57 with an average rating of 8.4. It's likely to go higher, because the movie's IMDB page show it as 8.8 with 26K ratings. How high will it go? Who knows? Top 15 maybe? At any rate, I'm so happy that this has occurred.

3 June 2022,That's something different that we normally get and it's positive.,"I think we can all agree this isn't the easiest movie to watch. You have to be really focused all the time, otherwise you will lose important things in order to follow the story. It's a difficult story but certainly not a bad one, on the contrary, it's a visual fest sometimes. If you don't like slow paced movies you should give this one a try, as it is the complete opposite, very fast paced, jumping from one scene to another in no particular order. I thought the storyline was very imaginative, almost made me wonder what drugs they used whilst writing this story. The acting was also very good, especially from the lead actress Michelle Yeoh, but the rest of the cast was also faultless. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a perfect title for this spectacular movie. Some people might need a second viewing to fully understand the whole concept but since the quality of this movie is of another level that shouldn't be a problem.

16 August 2022,it really was everything everywhere all at once,"I'm gonna be honest here and say I was disappointed that I didn't absolutely LOVE this movie like so many other reviewers- but I hope through my explanation you can see why. Is this a bad film? Oh, absolutely not. It's incredibly charming and delightful at times, and even very meaningful- and made me cry towards the end. Where my problem lies with this film though is through its messaging. There are some basic flaws to be had with this one, it can be predictable at times, its pacing can kinda drag, and there are quite a few cliche moments here and there- but most of them feel insignificant enough to ignore and enjoy the incredibly bizarre atmosphere and story this film is trying to tell. Its overall meaning though feels a bit squired, and feels very mixed in my mind. I know it means well, but I can't help but feel it doesn't do enough to satisfy me. All this time they are dealing between the relationship of the mother and the daughter, and still as the film comes to an end we see the mother nitpicking and not changing. She seems willing to change, but then does nothing in the end to resolve these facts and it just feels a bit too messy to ignore. Not only that, but the fact that just because the mom loves the daughter is an excuse for her to keep hurting her- is not okay, and I feel kind of hurt that a lot of that goes unresolved and the tone seems to pick up where the story has no right to let off. If you can get past that, the film is enjoyable. It definitely feels otherworldly, and has a very unique feel. It's easily a very originally made film, with some familiar elements, and visually it is also quite beautiful to watch and see unfold. The acting is incredible and I love how detailed and full of life each little character is, never shining away from darker elements, even if it means not fully settling things. It has some missteps here and there for me, and I can't ignore certain aspects of it- but in the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once does deliver on its promise enough to be enjoyable and is certainly a memorable watch.

My Rating: 7.3/10.",7
30 May 2022,A Revolutionary Game Changer in Profound Storytelling,"Rarely does a film manage to explore so many themes about the multiverse all at once successfully, because the ones that do have to defy all plausibility to achieve a worthwhile story. In the case of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's latest feature Everything Everywhere All At Once, the endless imagination shown on screen has never felt so sincere. With the film having garnished critical acclaim from critics and moviegoers alike, one has to wonder how this movie managed to pull off an overly complicated multiverse premise. The answer, as simple as it may sound, lies in one unhappy woman in an unfulfilled life.

The film stars Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Quan Wang, a Chinese American woman who faces a serious IRS audit. Upon discovering a more serious threat in parallel universes, Wang must connect with alternate versions of herself to prevent ultimate multiverse destruction. With that premise established, not even that synopsis alone can summarize how overly complex the storytelling is. By subverting this story of an unhappy woman's life in her failing business along with her naive husband Waymond and changing adult daughter Joy, the film knows how to balance its highly tense tone with a lot of absurdist humor and familial pathos. On top of that, there can't even be one genre to describe the movie, as there are numerous elements of black comedy, sci-fi fantasy, martial arts action, and even experimental animation. Of course, at the story's heart is a bittersweet domestic drama dealing with marital problems, immigration trauma and a struggling mother-daughter relationship. In the end, the creative elements cleverly service the swirling multiverse angle in lieu of a straightforward drama.

In analyzing the meaning of life through generational nihilism and otherworldly profoundness, the filmmakers accomplished telling so many different stories while bringing them all back to the main focus. While the film can go on a bit long in its excessive imagination, it makes every scene worth the runtime with a fun mix of entertaining fluff and emotional substance. For all of the entertaining action choreography, gripping stakes and hilarious transition from one weird world to another, the craziness has a purpose in developing Evelyn past her mistakes in order to move towards being a better person. Given how much society tends to put down those who think outside our own universe, never has one whole movie felt like such a relatable palate cleanser. Maybe it might be from the cast's spot on performances, especially depending on the universe, but seeing so many different points of view on one subject matter alone makes the experience far more sympathetic than it might have been without everything occurring all at once. It's all out there in the best possible way.

Of all the weirdly unconventional thrill rides of a motion picture in the history of filmmaking, very few seem to even come close to the absurd brilliance of Everything Everywhere All At Once. While it might seem like a lot to take in as far as tackling so much in more than two hours, it will surely inspire at least one human being to find proper meaning in their life once and for all. Regardless of who you are and where you are, I would recommend this to everyone in the world. It's a movie with a lot on its mind, just like how you will feel after seeing it. That alone is worth risking everything for just one view.",10
15 April 2022,Great beginning. Messy Endings.,"Part 1: Everything was pretty solid. Interesting premise, great action scenes and humour. Was enjoying it a lot.

The parts onwards just spectacularly derailed. It became an incoherent loud mess of nothing. It felt long but didn't really serve an overall purpose. I understand the ending and the ""message"" but it felt messy in my opinion.

The final act really had to deliver to be able to fully appreciate and enjoy this film. In which it failed.

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

23 March 2023,Overhyped is all I could say,"Not a bad movie at all. But I expected more from a movie that won seven oscars. The main plotline could have been different from sexuality. There are lot of issues other than this that could have been a core for the family storyline. The multiversal concept was nicely blended as it should ideally be for this genre. The only problem I have is with the propaganda that comes in every movie and this is probably the sole reason why it was being pushed towards mainstream media. The acting, direction, cinematography is quite good, has a lot of finesses specially the character of the husband. But at times, the story might stretch even though the pacing is fast and there is no explanation as to why this was the case.

30 December 2022,A Pointless Bucket of Tedious Sophomoric Visual Metaphors,"The onslaught of Visual Metaphors gets old, and one is looking for the film to just get it over with and end. So disappointing - doesn't live up to expectations nor the hype. First half has some engaging moments, but it could have wrapped up scenes without ""explaining"" what we already knew. I don't need a primer to explain the content and themes of a film thank you very much.

This film could have been so much better, but it fails to rely upon the intricate visuals (so painstakingly laid out), deciding instead we needed ""explanation"" of the filmmakers' intent. Such a hedge essentially ruined this film - it is awkward and runs about 45 minutes too long because of it. Nice effort visually - my rating is frankly higher than I feel it should be, but the visuals were often witty, so...5.

Overall, I had to force myself to see entire film, and it was painful. I feel cheated out of ""what could have been."" Perhaps one Director would have made a difference. Don't know. Won't ever know. It's a self-indulgent mess. üí£",5
29 March 2023,Terrible Movie - Stay Away,"I have a unique perspective on this movie. I write articles on quantum physics and parallel universes. Also write a newsletter on ancient mystery schools. The writing is trash. It looks like a sophomore in High School took an High School quantum physics basic course and wrote the script. The script was ALL wrong. The acting was good. The directing sucked, why the subtitles. When subtitles enhance the movie, put some in. Here they detracted from the movie and made the movie suck even more. The Bruce Lee marital arts sections were wrong, long and boring. FIRST MOVIE IN 30 YEARS THAT I WALKED OUT OF -- and got my money back.

13 March 2023,There will be a before and after this movie,"I watched this movie with my wife. She hated it. I loved it. It's that kind of movie. You either love it or you hate it. The bits that made me laugh were the bits that lost my wife. She thought it was ridiculous at times. That it went too far. I disagree. Like the 1st Matrix, the concept here allows for everything to be possible. Imagination is the limit. The Matrix being a blockbuster action movie, it was stuck within its own limitations. This independent movie has no limitations, no boundaries and it shows. It goes as far as it can. It made me care, it made me laugh, it made me unconformable at times. It made me feels many emotions that a sci-fi movie doesn't usually make you feel. This movie is a metaphor, an allegory of life. In the end it made me reflect on my own life and my past choices.

I understand it's not a movie for everyone. I don't judge. It's not about ""getting it"". I understand some people don't like it and feel a bit angered by the overall praise.

Anyway, it's a bold movie that took some major risks. And it paid off. I believe other movies will learn from this one and be inspired by it. And that there is a before and after this movie.",10

11 April 2022,WOWWW!,"My first instinct is to say ""they don't make em like this anymore"" but that begs the question: ""when did they ever?""

Everything Everywhere All at Once is genuinely one of the best films I have ever seen. I have nothing to say other than I loved every second of this masterpiece. No movie is objectively flawless; it's simply not possible. This just so happens to be a film that works for me on every level. In a release lineup packed with Fantastic Beasts, Sonic 2 and Ambulance, This movie is the one to see if you're looking for something truly special.

24 July 2023,Best Picture?,"This is a good movie. It might be a Very good movie. But there is nothing, not one exceptional quality about this movie that puts it into the top tier of films.

The reason this is a problem is in 2022? There were some 9/10, 10/10 type movies that were exceptional in: writing, direction, overall production, camera, story, characters, entire sum of parts.

Everything Everywhere All at Once? Does not live up to its pretentious title, let alone stand up to other truly great films, made by great film makers.

By comparison, this movie comes off as experimental, and a first try by young film makers. In recent history, the South Korean movie Parasite? That was an exceptional film, with a stunning degree of detail, made by a master director who has honed his craft for decades!

This is a very good movie about an asian American family with culturally interesting array of issues, injected with a bizarre science fiction element, borrowed from recent superhero films. Funny thing is, the meta-verse idea? It's reason for existing? Has more to do with making the same franchise over and over again, trying to give it meaning... Is it clever use in this film? Maybe? But everything feels staged, unreal - and that lack of grounding makes for tedious moments and scenes, where as a viewer? Ok! Thats weird, and makes no sense, except as following words on a page, script?

Reminds me of reading about the script evolution of the movie Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind ... A Great movie. The original script drafts were wildly experimental, having to do with repeat visitations to the same memories over and over - but over time and drafts? That script was tamed/mastered, and made for a touching, grounded, fascinating science fiction experience - not to mention, including an apt title that fit the content.

Everything Everywhere All at Once? How could that title Ever be satisfied? Isn't best picture, best actors, best directors supposed to be about Merit? Isn't supposed to be about what is objectively the best? I know it's a subjective sector, but there are real metrics that can be analyzed - and this film comes up woefully short in every single respect! This is seriously like giving Spiderman: No Way Home several academy awards because it was a good entertaining movie, that everyone involved somehow found a way to politic into critical success. That doesn't mean either are bad movies... But it does mean that the Academy award winners are a joke - don't reward merit, which makes that entire celebration of the arts? Questionable. I do still think, by and large, nominations still have value, but on this current path? Even nominated movies may end up chosen for reasons other than actual film making merit, which is unfortunate.",6
22 May 2022,A spark of light in the infinite cinematic universe of darkness,"This here is the Evangelion of the cinema. Finally, after 3 years - a movie that actually I didn't have to FFW most of the time. It's wacky, it's confusing in a proper measure when it's the right time to be confusing, it's preposterous at times (Look for a guy doing it with a table lamp) but if you are not one of those people who watch a part of a movie, or read a part of a book, and decides on a judgement with an incomplete experience - you will watch this entire epic and you might just enjoy, or have fun, or feel relieved in this time of uncertainty. I wanted to say something about prizes and Oscars, but let them slap around. Awards don't make a good movie, good writing and execution do. And this was obviously a hard movie both to write and execute - and it was done accordingly. I am happy I've taken time to watch this, and I don't remember a movie leaving such a good taste after finishing it for a long time now. This is great.

21 May 2022,Good but...,"I honestly expected more from an A24 film. With all the hype, I expected this film to be a total mind f$%^ and to leave me excited, confused, and wanting to think more about it.

I say it's good because it is, I think it's hyper relevant for today. The movie is all about the infinite possibilities in the one life we live and the crippling anxiety that comes with the choice to live one life out of infinite. This plot is interesting, the cinematography is fun, the humor is, well not my speed. I just think the plot could have been utilized in a more cerebral and thought provoking way.

That's all, I hope you found this review helpful. I would recommend going out and seeing the film and I would be interested if you agree or disagree.

7 October 2022,Everything Everywhere All at Once - Bites Off More Than It Can Chew,"This is a thought-provoking film; and an entertaining one as well. However, it certainly does bite off a bit more than it can chew. The subject of alternative universes has been done several times before; a few better, but most not as good as this film. The two Dannys do a fine job writing and producing this film. The film can even pass for a horror movie since it includes the IRS, a far more horrible monster than any ever conceived on film. Michelle Yeoh does a very nice job in her role as does Ke Huy Quan as her husband. I think at one time or another, we all would like to be in alternate universes. Just too much on the plate here.

9 June 2022,"Nice to see Yeoh, to see Yeoh Nice.","I was a bit concerned that the hype for ""Everything Everywhere all at once"" might lead to inevitable disappointment when it came to seeing it, and perhaps for the first 10 minutes or so, I felt like that might be the case. Fortunately, though, once the real plot of the film began, I was blown away on a cavalcade of humour, wit, but mostly just ideas, that make the film a pretty unique experience.

Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) is generally disappointed with how her life has turned out. None of the three relationships in her life, with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), her father (James Hong) or her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) is particularly happy and her laundrette is in trouble, and due for a tax audit. One the day of the audit, she's contacted by an alternate version of her husband who explains that he's been searching the multiverse for her, as she might be the only hope against a dark force.

Already I feel like that's more plot than I'm happy giving to anyone who might be interested in seeing ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"". Once the plot starts in earnest it's really a film unlike any other - there are some elements like ""The Matrix"" and some a bit like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but to describe it as being like either film isn't really. It's a constantly inventive story, thrilling just to look at, let alone to follow along with. It's consistently funny, despite its moments of action and occasionally mild horror.

It's grounded in a great performance though from Yeoh and terrific supporting ones from Ke Huy Quan and especially Stephanie Hsu. That grounded performance is paid off too, in a resolution that, without spoiling anything, is surprisingly profound and emotional.

I can see why it won't gel with some people but with me it absolutely did and I was dazzled, amused and moved throughout.",9

28 January 2023,Highly original and exhausting at the same time,"As ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" (2022 release; 139 min.) opens, we are introduced to Evelyn Quan, who along with her husband, runs a laundromat. For reasons unknown, the laundromat is being audited by the IRS, and a meeting with the IRS auditor does not go well. Then out of the blue, Evelyn's mind is taken over by her husband's alternative from the Alphaverse, one of apparently thousands of alternative universes out there... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.

Couple of comment: this is the latest from writers-producers-directors Daniel Kwam and Daniel Scheineret (a/k/a ""the Danierls""). This is only their second feature length movie, after 2016's critically acclaimed ""Swiss Army Man"". Like that movie, in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" they bring a highly original premise and story line. Frankly, the plot is so off kilter that it doesn't even make any sense, nor need it be. Instead, one simply sits back and enjoys whatever is unfolding on the screen. Michelle Yeoh is outstanding as Evelyn. I didn't realize that the IRS auditor is played by Jamie Lee Curtis until the credits rolled. I don't know if others felt the same, but I felt a bit overwhelmed, if npot exhausted, by it all and I watched the entire movie over two equal parts on consecutive evenings. That does not mean that I didn't like the movie, let me be clear.

""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" was an unexpected box office hit during its US theatrical run that started last Spring, For whatever reason I just didn't feel drawn to it. Then earlier this week, it gathered an amazing 11 Oscar nominations, more than any other film, and I told myself I really needed to find out what the buzz was all about. I watched the film earlier this week (it's streaming on Showtime). Glad I did. If you are in the mood for truly something very different and uniquely original, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",7
5 April 2022,A Classic for the Future,"I was losing my mind while watching it. There are lots of things and reference that keeps you pump up, and it's just hilarious.

However, the main metaphor of the movie just seem very weak, and draggy at the end. At its basic, it's about a mother daughter relationship, however, the chemistry and backstory isn't there to justified the ending that was chosen.

That said, I choose not to be too bothered by it, and just enjoy the film at its surface.

Producers: Russo Brothers, Casting Director: Sarah for all you marvel fans.

23 February 2023,Amazing...,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a middle-aged Chinese immigrant getting into an extraordinary adventure. She will soon find herself trying to save her own existence by exploring other universes.

I was simply fascinated by this movie and I have to admit that it left me speechless. The plot was a big surprise for me since it contained plenty of action and it was combined very well with mystery and fantasy. The direction which was made by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert who are also the writers did an amazing job and they presented their main characters and the plot very well. Regarding the interpretations of both Michelle Yeoh's who played as Evelyn Wang and Ke Huy Quan's who played as Waymond Wang were outstanding and they made the difference. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a nice, interesting movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.

As far as story goes it is a good story although a little confusing. But it's understandably a confusing story because it's about Multiple universes. The dialog is good not cringe at all. There is a lot of action scenes some heartfelt moments as well as some comic relief sprinkle throughout.

Just make sure your paying attention throughout the whole film I also miss something important.

10 December 2022,"um, what was that?","Had such high hopes for this movie. It's one of those that the title just grabs you without knowing anything about it. Almost convinced my wife to watch it with me. Well, I'm glad I didn't. The movie had so many awkward moments and it tried to send a message of some kind the whole time, but somehow I did not buy it. It reminded me of some other multiverse movies(it borrows from them too), but does its own, I call it goofy version, which I did not enjoy at all. I haven't seen it mentioned here, but there's something about it that made me recall Cloud Atlas. Maybe because it involved same characters in different scenarios? I can see the effort put in it and the acting was quite good, but after it was over I felt like watching some random fan fiction parody. To me it does not feel like a complete movie and it is understandable considering the smaller budget. However, there should be a fine line between cheap production and just having low budget. A real masterpiece is the one you can never guess the budget for it. The movie is okay to watch even if a bit long, but doesn't come even close to TOP 250.

18 January 2023,A multiverse of brilliance,"The thing that impresses me most about this movie is how it remains coherent in spite of the multiple threads, not least the different iterations of each character, and how it manages to bring those threads together at the end, to be poignant and relevant, but to do this and be laugh-out-loud hilarious, too - that's something special.

Up until Everything Everywhere All at Once, I hadn't seen either Michelle Yeoh or Jamie Lee Curtis do comical performances (I do watch movies and TV, honest), so the whole thing was a double delight!

We could talk about the science fiction and how the movie was another take on the multiverse, but these were mere vehicles to whisk us along and communicate some strong themes, much the same as the outlandish weirdness of Being John Malkovich.

It does demonstrate something I've learned as an aspiring writer: it makes no difference how implausible a situation is so long as the characters acknowledge and respond to things as we would ... to a degree - here I'm thinking about the head-with-legs scene in The Thing with Kurt Russell.

An excellent movie.",10
8 April 2022,Deliciously insane!,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is totally and completely bonkers in the best way. It's charming, heartwarming and incredibly weird. Michelle Yeoh is great in the lead role, and the entire supporting cast all do an excellent job pulling off a story that is as far out there as it gets. The film is hilariously funny, action packed, and very genuine is its message, presenting a timely theme of generational change and the existential crisis of modern youth. Top notch editing also makes the madcap story progression really shine, overall one of the best films I've seen in a while.

Seriously, I'm 63 years old, and there's not much that surprises, let alone dynamicly engages me in a way I have not experienced. Last year, over several months I experimented with several psychedelic substances. They did not deliver one tenth of what this movie did. I'll leave it at that. I do believe that those of average intelligence will hate this film, and the ones and threes bear this out. Either this film will wildly exceed your every expectation, or it won't.

14 March 2023,Metaphorical Fullness,"The Daniels (Kwan and Scheinert) are a pair of young North American directors and screenwriters, who started out making music videos and managed to make the transition to film, using a lot of digital effects and a good dose of imagination.

They have in this film the consecration of Hollywood, which has certainly seen in this duo, an innovative cinematographic language, capable of captivating a young audience, accustomed to the breakneck pace of video games, in this age of the Internet and comics adapted to cinema.

The work is interesting, displaying a set of parallel metaphorical universes, from which it extracts, however, banal, albeit well-intentioned, narrative and ethical solutions to everyday problems, no less banal.

The real innovation of the film is the combination, in a single package, of a breakneck pace, a delirious imagination, an amalgamation of popular culture references, with a special focus on martial arts films and a panoply of state-of-the-art visual effects.

It may not excite those over 40 years of age, but it certainly impresses, while seeming to ecstatic the younger ones.",7

Yes it is a great and beautifully made movie, from the cinematography to the script writing, the acting and the costume design, everything about this movie was done to almost perfection.

If you make the decision to see this movie, after 2 hours you'd be filled with so much emotions, good emotions you'd probably cry tears of joy. A job well done and the high ratings you see isn't just hype.

Enjoy the ride.

3 March 2023,Something Unique,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

12 April 2022,One of the most creative movies to come out in a while,"In today's landscape of superheroes, reboots, generic action/adventure movies, this film stands a head above the rest for trying to do something different. It's incredibly absurd, wildly creative, hilarious, and emotional. Try seeing it in the movie theater at least once because I can assure you, it is an experience.

24 January 2023,Could have been butt if....,"And no that's not a misspelling lol....what a ridiculously stupid storyline that added absolutely no value to the film. If not for that it could have been higher rated. Good movie with a lot of amazing themes that they tackled well..themes about family and how we treat people...definitely much needed and much appreciated.

Waymond is my fav character and Quan portrays him in spectacular fashion. Yeoh did a good job as well. I'm still wondering how I made it 9 months never having heard of this movie but I guess not much budget was made available for marketing.

...but it's not Best Picture worthy.

13 March 2023,Hollywood and the Academy have lost their minds,"I don't know if I missed something or if Hollywood thinks that it's a group of deep thinkers. But this movie is just plain stupid. None of it makes much sense. It has terrible story line and absolutely no point at all.. I watch the Oscars tonight and I saw it on Amazon prime and I thought I would give it a shot. But quite possibly this could be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and it's two hours and 19 minutes I'll never get back. I actually feel like the Academy has lost all sense of hope and Hollywood is lost probably should fall into the ocean. I it's like a bad episode, of Rick and Morty... where Rick and Morty are now Chinese.

13 March 2023,Beautiful art that makes you FEEL,"I saw this film in April 2022 without knowing anything about it; I went into the theater blind and not expecting anything in particular. By the end of the film I was shocked by how much I had laughed and cried.

The chaos demonstrated throughout the film is indicative of the chaos of our current world, the chaos in our minds as we try to navigate our careers and families and self, and the chaos of the unknown. I don't think I've ever teared up quite as much I did at the conclusion of the film. In the end, this is a movie about empathy, family, love, and kindness. The pure, unfiltered emotion that pours from this movie is so magical. I love-LOVE-a movie that can make me feel so much.

16 May 2022,One Wild Ride,"I'm not 100% sure of what was happening during each and every scene of this movie, but I know I had a great time, laughed a lot, and was even moved a lot at the end. Michelle Yeoh is excellent and it's nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis in a fun role like this.

9 May 2022,One of the best films i've ever seen.,"In all my years this colorful extremely funny mind bend of a movie is an instant classic and one to remember a story that at first glance seems like a cheesy action multiverse movie becomes a complex family story where each character gets their spotlight and show out. Highly recommend this film to anyone who needs something to watch. I watched this with my girlfriend and she cried i almost did too this movie hit the right feels. But it almost had its moments of being very cheery and fun. Please watch this movie whenever or however you can.

18 May 2022,Deceived!!!,"Existentialism? Okay. I watched this today and I kept checking the runtime bar frequently to see how far I've watched. It was long, longer than needed, too much ranting. Yada..yada! Even the greatly choreographed action sequences became tedious after some time. It was flashy, I give you that. I don't know how the 10-raters watched this without any constraints. I get the message, I just care less about it. I liked the concept, ideas and all but this movie does not justify the rating. But the perfomance, particularly of Michelle Yeoh was superb. Good movie but not a fan.

6 September 2022,Something missing.,"Definitely a very creative movie. The directing, cinematography, and acting are great, especially from the lead (Yeoh).

The movie is missing something that I can't quite put my finger on, and it keeps it from being the masterpiece it probably could have been. My only tangible complaints are an over-abundance of touchy feely crap, and that the husband is absolutely obnoxious. Even just his voice grates on you. The movie is also at least half an hour longer than it really needed to be.

None of these issues explain why it was so hard to pay attention to this movie though. The entire time I thought that I /should/ be enjoying it, but I simply wasn't. I have no idea what the actual issue is, it just seems like the movie could have been much better than it was.

23 March 2023,"""Was that it?""","Being of a certain age , you grow accustomed to the hype blowing in and then back out again around the major award ceremonies so I took with a pinch of salt all the praise Everything, Everywhere, All at Once has garnered.

After sitting through the 2 odd hours all kinds of review comments came flashing back to me but to my honest surprise all I could think was ""is this the worst film"" ever to win the best picture Oscar?

Still several hours after finishing the film I can't see any highlights and this film was supposed have the best actors of the last 12 months?? Really????

The premise of the film is genius and has an endless amount of potential but what I took from it all was just a mixed mess of mediocrity I know it's all a matter of taste but how this movie ousted All Quiet on the Western Front from best picture at the Oscar's is just a joke.",5
6 March 2023,Watched a couple times,"In the first 30 mins, I thought... hmm.... Low budget and crazy movie, but funny, ok, I can continue. I did not pay enough attention at the beginning but just casually watched it.

Then, I found that there are so many messages and meanings inside. I was so touched at the end.

I love this movie so much, I watched a couple times and found that I missed a lot at the beginning.

Highly recommend u to pay more attention to all the details. I think I need to watch it again.

Thanks to the 2 Daniel boys as what James Hong said.

Thanks to Jackie Chan for not taking this movie. I am sure Michelle Yeoh and Kwan play way better than him.",10
12 March 2023,A NEW GENRE MASTERPIECE,"Daniel Kwan & Daniel Scheinert's dazzling, mind-bending, muti-verse fantasy epic film is unlike anything that has ever been seen on the big screen. I did not get a chance to see this unique film in cinema this past year, I recently saw it on the Amazon prime steaming service. Indeed the story is complicated and the film itself is very confusing at first, but it is truly a fantastic motion picture filled with grandiose ambitions and vivld imagination. It concerns a middle-aged Chinese immigrant named Evelyn Wang, brilliantly played with a serious conviction by Michelle Yeoh who won a richly earned Oscar, Golden Globe Award and SAGA Award for Best Actress, her wimpy husband Waymond, terrifically played by Ke Huy Quan who delivered an Oscar, Golden Globe Award and SAGA Award winning performance for Best Supporting Actor, who both own and run a large neighborhood laundromat that is on the verge of financial failure. The troubled Evelyn also struggles to cope with her rocky marriage to Waymond, her judgmental father Gong Gong, wonderfully played by the legendary 94 year old veteran character actor James Hong, and her insecure gay daughter Joy, superbly played by Stephanie Hsu in an Oscar and SAGA Award nominated turn for Best Supporting Actress. Because of her mounting income tax troubles Evelyn now has to face a shabbily-dressed IRS auditor from hell named Deirdre Beaubeirdre, sensationally played by a nearly unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis in an hilarious scene-stealing Oscar, Golden Golden Award and SAGA Award winning performance for Best Supporting Actress. Evelyn's unpleasant meeting with Deirdre at the IRS office will change her life when she becomes swept away in a insane muti-verse adventure in which she alone will save the world from an all-powerful evil entity while connecting with the other lives she could of led. Exceptional Oscar winning direction by Kwan & Scheinert who also won Oscars for their amazing Original Screenplay. Impressive visual effects, and striking cinematography by Larkin Seiple, and an evocative Oscar nominated score by Son Lux. This new surrealistic genre masterpiece is genuinely moving and utterly hilarious not to mention visually stunning. Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture.",10

Also, great acting is not enough to describe the acting.

1 April 2022,"Unique, exciting, funny, touching... literally ""everything"", as the title implies.","This is a movie for which I came in with no expectations or prior knowledge, except something about googly eyes. Having watched the trailer after the fact, I think I still would not have been prepared for just how absurdly fantastic and out of this world EEAAO would be. This movie is probably one of the most unique films I've ever seen. It's not simply the visuals as others have pointed out that make this movie so different. It is also the direction, storytelling style, humor, and just the entire vibe of the movie, which blends and shifts between different elements and styles as fluidly as our protagonists shifts between versions of herself.

The writing and direction here are top notch. While it does rush through the specifics of how the multiverse travel works, it explains precisely enough for you to follow along while not boring the audience with too many details. The main plot is laid out early, and is relatively straightforward, but still has enough twists and turns along the way to make it really fun and interesting. Our main antagonist and the main plot device are... fantastic, you'll see. The writing really shines when it comes to character development. This is heightened due to us of course seeing multiple versions of each character. We are able to see how characters differ in various universes, but also the core things that stay the same and really make each character who they are. More so than any other multiverse movie (which there are a lot of these days), this film really uses the alternate versions well as vehicles in order to further develop the main versions of our protagonists. A big part of this is the direction, and how the jumps between different multiverses are shot and timed. This is especially incredible during fight scenes, in which it will often quickly snap back and forth between the different versions of characters. It looked really slick and I'm in awe at how they were able to film it so well.

As far as the acting - every single member of the cast was so superb. Michelle Yeoh was INCREDIBLE, I truly hope she gets nationwide recognition for her work here. She had amazing stunts as always, but also had scenes in which she could really showcase her acting and comedic timing. Ke Huy Quan, the actor who plays Waymond, was equally superb in my eyes. Some of you might recognize him as the little kid from Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom! His entire character is so unique, playing mostly a fragile man with a high pitched voice, but he really shines in ways you would not expect. He has one of the most memorable and well delivered scenes in the whole movie, which nearly brought me to tears. It seems he does not act much anymore but I would love to see him in more stuff. Stephanie Hsu, the daughter, was also fantastic and brought an amazing charisma to the movie. Good ole reliable James Hong did his thing as always. Probably the most interesting and funny performance to me was Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre, the IRS lady, who had some hilarious moments throughout the movie. All in all a stellar job from the entire cast.

While I will likely need a second watch to try and fully grasp the message here (though not every movie has to have one), I did have a few takeaways on initial watch. I think this film really tries to tell us to appreciate what we have, even though it is quite literally focusing on the ""what ifs"" that lead to the alternate realities. Again without spoiling, each version of our protagonist has some flaws (some REALLY weird ones as you'll see) or some regrets. Applying this to just our non-multiversal reality, we tend to focus on what our peers around us have that we don't, when we should actually realize that everyone has things they regret or feel are missing. We should instead focus on fully cherishing the life we have and loving the people immediately around us. Another message, closely related to the first, seemed to be that we should sometimes slow down and just soak in what is around us rather than constantly worry about what is next. One particular scene involving silence and rocks especially drove this home. This soundless scene was placed so perfectly in the middle of a super audio-visual movie, and really made me feel how nice it was to just soak in the silence sometimes.

A24 absolutely killed it with this one. I cannot wait to see what they have in store next. And I sincerely hope this film gets the recognition it deserves and wins awards. 10/10.",10
30 May 2022,Totally original movie with plenty of depth. Brave in themes and execution. But not all that exciting or emotionally affecting,"This film has great depth and the themes within it were great. It looks at such things as interconnectedness, family, personal power, free will, and the epidemic of the modern age - nihilism. In a world which seems determined to deconstruct absolutely every cornerstone on which society and humanity has been built, even down to the most intimate parts of ourselves e.g. Gender, nihilism to many feels like an inescapable black hole the devil pushes them towards and that they constantly struggle to avoid being sucked into. The Bagel is a representation of that lurking black hole that Joy has almost given into. Though many films have brooding or dark characters burdened by nihilism, Everything Everywhere is brave enough to build a film around it as the central obstacle for overcoming, and to have an open discussion about it, and is brave enough even to put forward an antidote - love. We need more films brave enough to offer people stories and forums for making sense of the challenge of finding meaning in our perplexing and chaotic modern world. So I enjoyed the depth within the film very much.

It is also totally original in its style of execution and blending of genres. I've not seen a film quite like it before. It is a mix of superhero, sci-fi, action, comedy, and pulls influences from many places, often in an obvious and conspicuous way which makes it feel rather meta. It is a clear homage to such films as The Matrix, Police Story, and the MCU. It was so original in style that while watching it I was unable to form much judgment or grasp any familiar holds with which to make sense of it. I just had to watch it as if with a child's mind, to take it all in to make sense of only later on. So this part of the experience was also enjoyable and, as a film fan, the inspiration admirable.

However, at the end of the day when all is said and done, I didn't get into the story or the characters all that much. The acting didn't match the ambition of the film, the jokes largely fell flat. And it suffered from what most superhero movies do, which is having way too many gratuitous action sequences.

So overall, it has depth and enjoyable ideas and is definitely one to watch and has earned its place in film history with its originality. But it doesn't have the characters or emotional affect for me to be excited about watching it again.",7
19 May 2022,Everything and Everywhere,"The Dans have managed a marvelous achievement with this movie, in that neither me nor anyone with me lost interest for a moment throughout its entire duration. ""Everything Everywhere"" is frenetic, feverish, beautiful, strange, and ambitious - and it reminds me why I love to go to the movies.

I've just seen something the likes of which are mostly wholly original. A dash of culture clash for comedy, a sprinkle of family disconnect for drama, and a whopping platter of multiverse (just barely hanging on to science fiction) are familiar from other works. Yet in this concoction, it's bliss to my dumb little brain that aches to be entertained with something new each time I visit a theater.

I loved the whole cast, but I'd like to note Stephanie Hsu, who proved she had chops in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel but enraptured me with her role as the complicated Joy. I enjoyed the honesty with which other characters were portrayed - their failures, flaws, and even kinks help illustrate (and illuminate) them. I was taken in by their chemistry and made to laugh at their weirdness. And anytime a legend like Jamie Lee Curtis holds nothing back, I know I'm watching a special production.

The unfortunate thing is, I think many people will be put off by the colossal questions the Dans tackle. It's not like they were actually trying to solve the mysteries of the universe, but they do prod it and play with it in colorful fashion; and any time you dabble with existential confusion, it can draw away from concrete ideas that actually do have answers. I think the filmmakers achieve something beautiful with this film, because despite their exploration of ""the meaning of life"" (worded more accurately as ""our feeling like small pieces of $#!t""), they manage to loop back to simple offerings. Such as, perhaps simple emotion, shared with a loved one, is worthy of our perseverance. Or better yet - perhaps nothing matters at all, so why not just enjoy our time here. There is brilliance in squashing high concepts into digestible thoughts, and it's done in satisfying fashion here. Credit to the performances who sell their emotions, because without them it wouldn't have worked.

Then there's the pure joy of sitting through a hallucinogenic, action-packed, billion-colored stream of scenes, each one with its own hilarious Chekhov's guns and costumes and props of absurd variety. It's excitement you can cash in at the end and chew on for awhile.

It's not a perfect movie, but who am I to point out its flaws? I thought the pacing was too delirious in the first act, but someone else might call it effective. Some jokes didn't land because of their goofiness, but a different audience could have laughed. I really have few complaints. It's rare to witness something so unique shine so bright. Sometimes I feel like I've seen every ""kind"" of movie, but then one like this (or Parasite, Her, Good Time, or the directors' previous standout Swiss Army Man) reminds me I'll never have seen it all.

One thing I know for sure is that I'm buying a ticket to every movie these two men make for the rest of their careers. I can't believe this early season of movies includes a gem as lovely as this one.",9
20 March 2023,I don't understand the hype,"I watched this film when it first came out on Amazon Prime in the UK. I was looking forward to seeing it. The premise sounded great, the trailers I'd seen looked pretty good and everyone seemed to be raving about it. The whole 'possible worlds' thing is really fascinating to me, I love sci-fi and anything that makes you think and question your own reality. So it's safe to say I was primed and ready to enjoy this film.

So I watched it, and it was... OK. That's it. I found it very underwhelming to be honest. Nothing particularly thought provoking or special. Much of it seemed to me to be an extended fight scene with some farcical elements. I'm not sure if they're supposed to be funny or not, I didn't find them to be especially funny.

After the Oscars bestowed it with so much praise I decided to revisit EEAAO and see if there was something I'd missed. Maybe I just hadn't been in the right frame of mind, or I've not paid enough attention. I thought there must be something that other people were seeing in this film that I'd failed to pick-up on my first watch. However, the second time around I didn't even finish it. I got tired/bored, turned it off and went to bed.

This is certainly not a terrible film, the acting is fine, there are some good action sequences, I think it just misses something with the plot. There's is so much possibility with a film about multiple universes, more than just a world of possibilities, there are literally MANY worlds of possibilities and yet you end up watching silly sequences like someone getting beaten up with massive dildos. Which is fine, I don't have a problem mixing sci-fi and comedy, it's just not really that funny. Or sci-fi.

Maybe that's the point, maybe it's trying not to take itself too seriously, and so to avoid getting too deep into the sci-fi elements of the story it makes light of them so that it focusses more on the interpersonal drama of the characters. In fact I might have enjoyed a comedy drama about this dysfunctional family more without all the multiple realities complicating things.

Whatever it is, it doesn't quite work as a character drama and it's not really that good as a multiverse sci-fi film.

Watch it, you might enjoy it, a lot of people seem to, but if you're particularly into sci-fi you might be a bit disappointed as that side of it isn't all that well executed, and if you're expecting it to be funny, well, it's not really.",6
14 January 2023,An experience,"I get it now. Watching this movie was truly an experience. For the most part, it was hilariously ridiculous at times that I could not help but burst into laughter but there were some poignant moments too that made me feel a little sad and I even cried at the end. It took me a while to understand that this movie is about love and relationships - with oneself, with a romantic partner, with a family member. And through the Asian American lens it showed a different and thankfully non-stereotypical perspective. I don't know how to explain it but I feel like I came out as a changed person after watching this movie. The cast was amazing too and the awards they won are absolutely well-deserved.

21 May 2022,Very solid movie but...,"Extremely overrated unless you've never thought about these things before and had your mind totally blown. This is absolutely not even close to one of the GOAT films but it was very well done! Would highly recommend to anyone but don't expect an 8.7/10 like it's currently rated. 7/10 at best. Since everyone and their mothers seem to think this was one of the most profound experiences of their lives, I highly recommend everyone who watched this movie try shrooms or DMT. Cheers.

13 March 2023,Utter drivel,"Does anyone actually take any notice of the Oscars anymore? I've been trying to recall the last time anything noteworthy won, because for the last few years the winning films have been absolutely awful. I don't know if it's Hollywood virtue signalling or the fact that someone, somewhere really thinks that these films are worthy of anything, let alone the supposedly most prestigious award the film industry has to offer. EEAAO is a prime example of this. It's a terrible film and you'll do well if you actually manage to suffer your way through the entire thing without the urge to pull out your eyeballs. Don't be fooled by the awards, it doesn't deserve any of them. Hollywood, take a hard look at yourself in the mirror!

17 January 2023,A BRUTALITY,"I just watched the film and it was a totally experience from beginning to end, I just love how original is, finally I can see a really multiverse and it was sooo good, the brutality of the action scenes were just perfect and also I love how In spite of the madness that contains the film they conserved the concept of FAMILY, the relationship mother-daughter it's just like the cherry on the cake cause is so well developed, the movie makes easy to understand it cause they explain so well everything without being bored, I just wanted to watch more and more, all of the actors are just amazing and the costumes especially the costumes of joy were such a masterpiece, nothing to say about the visual effects cause they were really great, A beautiful movie that you just have to watch.

I got to watch this movie again with my family and maybe watch it again alone and again and again...

18 September 2022,Open your third (googly) eye...,"Overwhelming in scale yet intimate in scope, 'Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022)' lives up to its title and is easily the best movie about the multiverse since Peter B. Parker crash landed in Miles Morales' world in 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)'. Daniels' second outing swaps farting corpses for sausage fingers, focusing on a woman whose world is cracked into an infinite number of fragments when an agent from an alternate reality informs her that she's the only thing in existence capable of stopping an upcoming cataclysm. The flick is as silly as it is sincere, playing with absolute absurdity but anchoring it within grounded relationships and character flaws. It's utterly ridiculous but oddly resonant, throwing so many high concepts at you that you're forced to accept each of them as soon as they come your way. It's very much a 'go with it' type of affair, even if its mechanics are surprisingly airtight and could be explored even further than they actually are. Just when it threatens to crumble under the weight of its increasingly out-there elements, the feature shifts gears and becomes a much more philosophical experience. Its first half is concerned with the what, while its second is concerned with the why. Tackling the bracing question of what it means to exist, seemingly alone, not just in an unfathomably large universe comprised of billions of galaxies, but in an infinite expanse of universes each as incalculably vast as the last is no mean feat. A trillion possibilities spiral into a trillion more until unfulfilled potential practically becomes as irrelevant as it is inevitable. It isn't a nihilist affair, though. It has an undercurrent of hope and, despite its heavy material, it never drags you down by feeling dour or sour. It dares deal with the existential questions guaranteed to have kept you up at night at least once, and it emerges with a fairly strong grasp on what makes life worth living. On top of that, the movie is just a ton of fun. It's an absolute riot with a quick pace, plenty of laughs and a strong emotional core. It's bright, colourful and incredibly inventive. It's also super stylish, presenting itself as a myriad of genres and changing visually each time it does. The most amazing part of all is that its visual effects were completed by just nine people - including the two directors - who learnt how to do them by watching free online tutorials. If that doesn't give you faith in the film industry, I don't know what does. In the end, the flick just exudes passion. It's an experience that feels hand-crafted to its very core, the rare example of a fantasy epic not stained by the obvious influence of studio interference. It's the sort of thing that puts a big smile on your face for its majority, especially in its more straightforwardly enjoyable first half. There are some truly fantastic action sequences here that evoke the wonder of Jackie Chan's early work, so much so that I'd easily say they're some of the best of their kind in years. That's not to imply the second half isn't successful in its own right. It has a genuine philosophical depth to it and its emotional underpinnings are properly resonant. Even though the affair doesn't affect me as much as it perhaps strives to in that latter regard, it still hits fairly hard and does everything it can to keep itself as down-to-earth as it needs to be for its impossibly elusive concepts to have any real weight. The real stakes are much more important than the just end of the multiverse precisely because they're actually much smaller. It's a really smart way of grounding the feature without dampening its creativity whatsoever. Creative doesn't even begin to describe this, either. It's such a bracingly original, thoroughly interesting and invigoratingly entertaining experience that it's impossible not to recommend. It's weird, wild and wonderful. Of course, it isn't perfect... but what is?",8
29 April 2022,Got to be my favourite movie of the year,"This film was an explosion of surrealist comedy mixed with hard-hitting commentary on a realistic issue which can occur in the lives of many families.

I loved all the characters and their journey's from beginning to end. The dialogue was really sharp and the strange non-linear storytelling was super effective.

In another universe I could have seen a film made around the same subject-matter which removes all the surrealist elements, but I'm so glad that the strange nature of this film was the route that they took. There is something truly special about films like this and I can't wait to get my own copy on blu-ray/DVD.

5 April 2022,If Michel Gondry directed the Matrix,"Michele Yeoh shines in this insane freaking film. The love scenes, especially, make this worth it. But I'd recommend seeing it sober.

This is the story of a girl, who cried a river and drowned the whole world .

31 January 2023,This Must Be What Being On An Acid Trip Is Like,"It was well shot, well acted, well choreographed and well edited. Almost everything about it is awesome. That having been said, it falls short on what really would have made it amazing... watchability.

It is simply far too far ""whacked out"" and we found ourselves waiting for the cacophony to stop... but the maelstrom continues from beginning to end. We didn't enjoy it as much as we had hoped we would. This movie is what a novel written by Picasso would look like: random visual chunks thrown against the canvas.

Sorry, but we definitely would not go to see this movie a second time. As much as there certainly was a great effort put into producing it by all who were involved, it is far, far too avant garde and did not impress us very much.

4 May 2022,It Really Was Everything! Wonderful and Sincere.,"This movie has everything- kung-fu, action, science fiction, other worlds, and even some things The Matrix doesn't have! That's a joke but there are some obvious similarities. Everything Everywhere All at Once is also really funny. The film was enjoyable and relatable as it dealt with a comic but deep existential search for life, not unlike I Heart Huckabees(2004). The movie also addresses generations and the culture of Chinese-Americans in similar ways to The Farewell(2019) and Saving Face(2004). I saw this movie as jam packed with beautiful ideas, themes, and different elements of film that really made it something special. Oh, and Michelle Yeoh was inspiring with an unbelievable performance. I left the theater feeling a sense of awe.

26 January 2023,Random is not the same as creative,"Unfortunately, it is not as fun as I was waiting. I can't understand all th hype honestly. It looked like my childhood games, where someone would say a piece of a story, then another one completes it. Not funny, just random. The drama didn't catch me either. I may have smiled one time along the whole movie. My girlfriend slept. The film has its moments and its great a indie film is grabbing attention, but please see with low expectations. If this is the best film ever, I just want to quit cinema. Or probably people are seeing only marvel movies. Actually, Wandavision is way better. Nice film, just not the best ever like everybody is saying.

28 June 2022,One of the craziest and best movies I've ever seen,"The first step is figuring out how to turn the concept into a tale, and they excelled beyond all comprehension in the process of turning a story into a motion picture. Second, everything worked flawlessly. Everything in the movie, including the visually stimulating soundtrack, the inventive action, the faultless acting, and the character writing, was just excellent. A meaningful and magnificent lesson can be discovered in all of these things. It's been a while since I merged like this. A great movie, one of the greatest movies I've ever watched.

3 August 2022,Rather impressive movie...,"For some reason, then I had been putting off getting to watch ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" a couple of months. And let me just say that it was a mistake on my account.

The storyline in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"", as written by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, was rather impressive. It was a very original storyline, one that proved every bit entertaining and enjoyable, as it was bizarre and hilarious. There were so many things going on in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"", that the movie is well worth watching more than just once.

I was initially drawn to the movie as it had Michelle Yeoh on the cast list, and she was spectacular in this movie. I dare say that her performance in this 2022 movie makes it worth the 139 minutes of watching the movie. Now, she wasn't alone in carrying the movie, because the entire cast performed quite well. It was a blast to see Jamie Lee Curtis in this movie and in such a role. The movie also had the legendary James Hong on the cast list.

Visually then ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a trip in its own. There are so many things going on that it is hard to take it all in at once. And as such, the movie can easily be seen more than a single time. And the visual effects in the movie as spot on and look good, which definitely talks in favor of the movie.

""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" was a blast of a surprise and a very enjoyable movie. Keep in mind, that the storyline itself is a bit spaced out and out there, but it works so wonderfully well. This movie from writers and directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert is a movie that I warmly recommend you to watch.

My rating of ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",7
10 April 2023,The Emperor's new clothes,"Honestly sometimes I think I am not on the same planet as other viewers: did we actually see the same movie? This movie was so confusing, repetitive and downright boring that I am stunned by reviewers that call it the best thing since sliced bread. To me it was a mish mosh of crazy events with the same characters cropping up as different beings - the whole thing happening in three parts -- I knew this because each part was written on the screen, oh thanks for that. I can see ex-acid heads and druggies loving it, finding it mind-blowing, literally, but for me, no, this movie was pretentious and pseudo artsy and basically like I already said, boring and repetitive. How it won so many academy awards is beyond me.

10 April 2022,"Amazing acting, writing, and EXPERIENCE","This movie is an amazing experience. One of the best movies I've seen in my life. Incredible talent and execution on all fronts. It is a movie unlike any other. It takes you into a different reality with many fantastical ideals and odd creations and somehow makes it not cheesy and awe-inspiring. Just incredible. Enjoy.

26 August 2022,Mindblown,"There is so much to take in from the plot of this movie, i decided not to be too overwhelmed even though it concerns something almost everyone can identify with. The script is very clever, but everything else is even better. The soundtrack works beautifully, and the editing is amazing to say the least. And as for the superb cast, Michelle Yeoh turns in a flawlessly perfect performance, while James Hong is delightful and Ke Huy Quan is top notch as well. Then there is Harry Shum who is a riot and the absolutely marvelous Jamie lee Curtis is spot on in her turn as different versions of Deirdre from different universes. Expect a lot of heart, a lot of soul and a lot of zaniness from this mindblowing film that you will benefit more and more from repeated viewings. Take it from someone who knows.

11 April 2022,"Wild, memorable and emotional","The most insane, visually compelling and long-winded story of generational trauma that I've seen in quite some time. And this is the same year we got an animated movie about a family tradition of passing down period pandas.

EEAAO is like an acid trip that pulls you in every possible direction, you never know what'll hit you next but you can't look away. The Daniels' take on exploring alternate realities is a refreshing and action packed one. There were so many times I couldn't tell whether to laugh or just look on in horror, but I smiled consistently throughout.

The strained dynamic between Joy and her mom slowly becomes apparent until a dramatic and tear-jerking conclusion. One scene in particular toward the end of the film really stuck with me in both how ridiculous and how sad it was, you could say it really.......rocked. I liked that between all the crazy and surreal aspects that the themes were cohesive and understandable, no ""EEAAO Explained"" youtube videos needed here.

I can't quite say that this became the new greatest film of all time for me. But it was truly original and fun, and an impressive step up for The Daniels' film style they established with Swiss Army Man. I'd love to watch it again soon and see how many little details I may have missed this first time around.",9
9 May 2022,Maybe the most perfect movie I've ever seen,"At first, I was a bit apprehensive that it would live up to the hype. But then it kept giving, and giving, and giving. I bought popcorn but a quarter way through the movie I was so choked up that I barely ate any of it. It's almost every genre wrapped in one--I laughed at some parts, hid my eyes behind my hands at some parts, and held back tears at others. It was a rollercoaster. The main character is like Neo if he were to be reincarnated into an old Chinese woman. Just go see it :)

29 August 2022,A hot steaming pile of metaphysical nonsense,"Have to love Michelle Yeon in this film, she was great, as usual.

The rest of it? Well, on occasion amusing, but mostly a waste of time This parallel universe smorgasbord pretends truly Deep Thoughts, but essentially boils down to a young lady having a temper tantrum, convinced her mother doesn't understand her. Oh, really? Yawn. The ultimate answer? Love your family. Uh huh.

Yeah, those ""insights"" have been stated many, many times before, usually in a much more elegant and impactful way than does this film. The movie has a few good moments, but falls pitifully short of its grand aspirations.

12 March 2023,BUCKLE UP AND DON'T BLINK!,"THE METAPHOR is alive and well, and it's a crying shame that these fun-hating low-star-raters haven't taken the time to familiarize themselves with it! I do have to say everything made a lot more sense upon my second viewing; the content is so jam packed that is easy to forget some of the details. Although this movie is a comedy, I had wet cheeks from crying happy tears at the end. I have always admired Michelle Yeoh in every role I have seen her play, so I knew to expect good things. However, I was not prepared for the numerous outrageous, ridiculous moments that had me frequently laughing out loud! There is nothing too random or too taboo for this film, yep, there went there...and there...and there!. If there is a message I took from this, it is that life is a chaotic, yet beautiful mess, and it should not be taken too seriously because NEWS FLASH: it could always be worse (for example, wieners for fingers and piano playing toes!).

14 March 2023,Well-Executed Risky Genre,"The style of EEAO reminds me a lot of Stephen Chow's over the top comedy genre. This style is normally seen in B Movie, but if it is executed well, it has a lot of potential to be an iconic legendary movie. Because the styles and the humor are sooo weirdddd...

Kudos to the team to pull this off. This is not an easy achievement, to blend absurd comedy with heartfelt deep drama.

TBH, I am not quite getting the message of this movie. It is as weird as Matrix and Life of Pi. And because as far as I understand, the storyline was structured like a collage, stitching small pieces of individual incident. It also involved a lot of symbolism and homages to popular culture. Again, this is a style you can find in Stephen Chow's movies, Chow mastered it, but rarely seen in Hollywood movies. Perhaps Kill Bill can come close to this style.

I am not gonna comment on the acting part. Yeoh, Lee-Curtis, and James Hong are solid actors.

7/10 from me. This is a movie that may reach a legendary status.",7

18 April 2022,Audacious to a fault,"When the trailer for this film was released, I didn't quite know what to think. As a strong supporter of A24 and as someone who appreciates Michelle Yeoh's acting skills, I was hoping this would be good, but also did not know whether its totally ""out there"" weirdness and tons of multiverse-related subplots would end up being a film more in love with itself than with its audience. While initially somewhat skeptical, I decided to see it after hearing ecstatic reviews and word-of-mouth from audiences. I'm certainly glad I did, as the film's unique audacity and strong performances make the film memorable, although it's not without its flaws.

The film follows Evelyn, who helps run a laundromat being audited by the IRS. One day while working on her taxes, she is sucked into a multiverse with infinite possibilities of potential past lives she could have had. In the multiverse, she is confronted with family struggle spanning a variety of different ""verses,"" and can ""jump"" between them. One should not go in, if at all possible, knowing significantly more about the plot than this. The film's two co-directors, together known as ""Daniels,"" deliver a visually engaging feast given that the film has an economical budget. Blending high-octane martial arts fights with loopy, quirky visions and a heavy dose of stylization, you can tell the aesthetics of the film took so much talent to produce. It's so offbeat and strange that even if you don't love everything you see, you just have to admire some of the creativity--at least initially. The Daniels previously worked on directing music videos (including the one for ""Turn Down for What,"") and you can tell their attention to style continues to work wonders in their directing methods today. By blending action with ""verse jumps"" and stylistic motifs, the film's editing--when at its best--can be spectacular and may remind the viewer of other tightly edited, stylized films like ""Baby Driver."" The acting is generally strong, as Yeoh provides a clear emotional range with unique degree of expressiveness and thoughtfulness.

Viewers will initially be impressed by the level of originality on display here--at least at first, because the film doesn't feel as precise and unique in the second half compared to the first half. While some of the action scenes (such as the first one) are extremely well choreographed, they start to get a bit repetitive and exhausting after a while. They all more or less have a similar style--and sometimes that style can be unique (especially if ""verse jumps"" are involved in clever ways,) but at other times it can start to wear out its welcome. The pacing of the film isn't particularly disciplined, but given the infinite nature of the ""multiverse,"" that might have been partially intentional. Nevertheless, the gradual increasing in redundancy in a few scenes combined with the lengthy, not-always-consistent runtime definitely means that the film's length could have been trimmed, and that despite the high level of creativity, sometimes it's possible to have too much of a good thing. The film's dialogue and attempts at philosophical messaging are solid, but these elements are strangely not ambitious like its visuals and attempts at crafting a variety of narratives.

While the film clearly works the strongest in its first half and may gradually feel a bit exhausting to some, it still is a thoroughly unique independent film that you certainly won't forget about after seeing. 7/10.",7
24 May 2023,Massively overhyped utter garbage,"I love weird movies. I love sci-fi movies. I love kung-fu movies. I love action movies. I love comedies. True to its name, Everything Everywhere All at Once tries to be all these things, and more. It fails in most everything.

There are some positive things, but it is a short list. The basic idea and the message the movie tries to impart are potentially interesting (but the movie fails completely in conveying them, to such an extent that it has to literally try to spell them out at the end). Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis give their all despite the relentless nonsense they are put through. Cinematography is rather good. Fight choreographies are decent.

Everything else is just missing. There is no comprehensible plot. Michelle Yeoh's character is the only one who even tries to be anything more than a comic book caricature, and the superhuman abilities make even her totally unrelatable. Pacing is abysmal. There is nothing original nor funny in the movie. It steals ideas from a multitude of sources (like The Matrix, Marvel universe, Hong Kong kung-fu movies, animes) with an utter lack of vision on how to put any of them into good use, and adds ""comedy"" via elementary-school-yard-funny level completely random stuff (like butt plugs, hot dog fingers and googly eyes).

I love ice cream. I love sushi. I love pizza. I love Chinese food. I love hamburgers. There is artistry in creating delicious combinations from unexpected ingredients. But if you just blindly toss every possible ingredient you can think of into a blender, you get unsavoury, inedible mess. Tossing nonpareils on top does not help, nor does supersizing the deplorable sludge. That is what Everything Everywhere All at Once is.",2
26 March 2022,A beautiful chaotic mess.,"Seems like everybody makes a Multiverse movies nowadays.

I'm a fan of Michelle Yeoh since Police Story 3... she lately for the past couple of years kinda have a renaissance in her acting career... she is everywhere... movies and TV.

Of all the movies she's in...I think she never play a role that carry a movie... she always part of ensembles. This is the best movie she's ever in that shows how great of an actor she is. She not just have a wide acting range... she have ALL the range.

This is the movie that her agent need to put in the top of her resume as reference when sending to movie studio for casting.

The movie itself kinda amazing... a beautiful chaotic mess, action packed, funny and emotional... I love how Multiverse were explained in the movie and the approach to Multiverse itself is very unique and new. The jump pad where they tap into Multiverse skills are hilarious.

The only one negative for me is the 3rd act... somehow the film maker couldn't find a way to neatly wrapped up the conclusion. Since it is a beautiful mess that are chaotic... the 3rd act keep going on and on and it become exhaustive. The runtime is around 2 hours... it could be tighten into 1 hour 45 minutes.

HIGHLY... highly recommended... 8/10... the actor who played the husband is the kid in Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom and The Goonies... he done a lot of acting work since then but I always remember him from that 2 movies.",8
11 April 2022,A Cinematic Trip For The Mind And Soul,"Upon seeing the trailer for Everything Everywhere All At Once, I sensed this film was something truly different. I have to say I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.

I won't say much about it other than it was much deeper and moving than I expected. It'll leave you dizzy and teary eyed, and I mean that in the best way possible.

Even though it's packed with action and lots of laughs (verbal and visual), this film demands your attention. So save the popcorn, Skittles and soda for the next Marvel schlock-fest, and buckle up, because you're in for one hell of a ride.

5 June 2022,The Multiverse Of Madness Is Moved By Love,"I'm so overwhelmed by the dynamic of this movie. My logic and intellect is stretched to its limit and then released. There's like a mini big bang in my head. This movie is crazy, wild and out of this world. Pun intended. But somehow through all of those craziness and dizziness, I've managed a scrap of truth. That the multiverse is moved by love. If you haven't watched this movie, then get ready to have your mind blown into tiny little pieces and then get it assembled back whole again. It's a once in a lifetime experience.

12 January 2023,Utterly Bonkers,"You could just leave it as the title says. I'm not doing any spoilers as I think it would spoil the fun when you watch it. First of all the acting is great. Michelle Yeoh deserves a clutch of awards for putting in a stellar performance. The supporting cast are great. The film itself is split into 3 parts. Everything , Everywhere and All at once.

Everything (Part 1) was the best of the three, the last part is only about 10 minutes long. If part 1 had ended the film, which it appeared to do , I think this would have been worthy of a 10 but part 2 kicked in and it was a bit long. You know when you start looking at the clock wondering when this is all going to get wrapped up. Don't get me wrong its still very good and the fight scenes are something to behold. Especially the one involving a butt plug (yes you need to watch this)/. So excellent film if it got a snip in part 2 it would have been a 10,

20 December 2022,If Marvel made this you would hate it.,"What's the difference between this and every recent movie made by Marvel? It's perhaps a little bit more innovative, but the biggest difference is the budget. They do great work with the limited budget which they have, but other than that it's pretty bland.

It's overwhelming and the multiverse-stuff doesn't make too much sense. If you see past the illogical stuff it's perhaps more of an enjoyable ride, but you could say the same thing about Marvel. The dialogue and humor is better than your average Marvel-movie, but the similarities are too similiar. This might aswell have been the sequel to No Way Home and it would make perfect sense.

What message was the movie trying to convey? That life is beautiful? It wasn't delivered very good which made the climax quite underwhelming. Even though the movie has a far amount of problems, it is a enjoyable and funny movie. Go see it.

16 January 2023,Beyond bizarre with crass imagery,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

24 March 2023,Not impressed,"I gave this a chance because of its Oscar wins. It's easy to see why current Hollywood decided it was good, since so much about it fits diversity quotas. I wasn't impressed. I did not like the look of the movie at all. The cinematography, lighting, color choices, etc aren't pleasing or interesting. Some might defend those choices as emphasizing the drabness of Evelyn's everyday existence, but it got no better when the wild multiverse stuff kicked in. Countless movies have far more impressive, more involving, more interesting, more coherent, more clearly thought out visuals. Evelyn's story is not particularly compelling (nor are the characters around her), nor are there any profound insights given. What we get is a pseudo-philosophical, rather nihilistic point of view that says life is essentially meaningless. No, the movie is.

12 January 2023,I'm not a sci-fi fan....but THIS!? Wow.,"Full disclosure. I never watch science fiction and have never been a fan. I only watched this because of the hype AND I am a huge fan of Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. Another honesty - IF I'd tried to watch it before the Golden Globes, I 'might' have turned it off half hour in. A 'what the bleep is this?' moment. I'm so gad I stuck with it (and may watch it again to see the nuances I missed first time round). Be prepared to go on a wildly frenetic, confusing, mind-boggling ride. And be prepared to also have your own inner thoughts challenged and poked. What an incredible ride. What an incredible insight opportunity in to your own life. Bravo to all the actors, the writers, director and the phenomenal editing.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

23 November 2022,Completely Bonkers but Also Vibrant and Heartwarming,"When Everything Everywhere All at Once begins, it doesn't just show you it's hand. The start of the film is a very sober look at Evelyn Wang's (Michelle Yeoh) complicated and largely grim existence. It could have been an indie drama at first glance, but if you're walking into this movie blind, you're in for quite the surprise. When we make our way to the movie's true genre (science fiction), we hit those universe hopping devices with Evelyn and we're going for a ride. This is both one of my favourite parts of the movie and my biggest complaint. You never know what's going to come next in this movie for better or for worse. There are some moments that perfectly accentuate the plot and the characters and then there are others that are going to leave more sensitive members of the audience either clutching their pearls or stomping out of the room. Everything is truly unpredictable from moment to moment, you can still plot the overall arc towards Evelyn's redemption but good luck determining where you're going next. These choices maintain the tension and the stakes so well but it undercuts the accessibility of the movie to everyone. This is a tradeoff that some people would gladly take but I saw this with a friend and it just didn't work for them with how scattershot Everything is (ALL HAIL THE BAGEL!).

One of my favourite choices that the creative team made with Everything was that they didn't paint Evelyn as the hero with the heart of gold who just needed an opportunity trope. Evelyn isn't despicable or even off-putting but she's all too human. She enjoys playing the martyr, she's ungrateful, she's not accepting of her daughter's choices and she's extremely critical of those around her. They have to walk a tightrope with her character being too unlikeable but I found the movie knew just when to pull back minus one or two slips. My favourite character was her husband Waymond from the original timeline. I just wanted to give him a hug and tell him he deserved better but his compassion and his inner strength hidden behind his meek exterior was inspiring (more on that later). The central players also gain perspective as the movie goes along in a way that didn't ring false or feel too sappy which is an accomplishment all by itself.

I'd call the cast of Everything recognizable but not truly elite. If you've been watching movies for the past 30 years, you know who Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis are but the names in the credits may not catch everyone's eye. It's nice to see Michelle Yeoh in a true starring role, she gets a character she can really sink her teeth into and she's great. I didn't recognize Ke Huy Quan but he was also noteworthy as largely mild mannered Waymond. I liked Stephanie Hsu as Joy, she played her character well but I do wish we had gotten to see more of a range from her instead of her being just sombre and snarky 90% of the time. Jamie Lee Curtis deserves a lot of praise just for doing so much of the ridiculous material in this movie. On top of that, she was able to do it without winking at the audience. She played her character seriously and I was ultimately impressed with her dedication.

Even with all the kooky scenes and awe inducing plot beats, Everything is definitely a movie with a message and to it's credit, it never loses sight of that. Everything doesn't say something that you haven't seen in another movie but I was surprised that I connected with it so completely. As I stated above, Evelyn's dissatisfaction with how her life turned out is understandable but her negativity is sucking the ""joy"" out of life for those around her. Waymond is the real hero and he breaks it down for her about fighting the hopelessness of the chaos in life with kindness and sincerity and how happiness can be a choice even when things seem bleak and depressing. The overall thesis of the movie is that even if there isn't a purpose to life and we're all doomed to live and die in a what amounts to a drop in the ocean of time, we get to choose what makes our life valuable and there is limitless beauty in that idea. This such a wonderful argument and I almost got emotional when Evelyn uses this realization to stop being so selfish and heal those who she's hurt. Even if the philosophical ground Everything covers has been tread upon before, it presents it in a humbling and heartfelt manner. Even though I had to be patient and wade through some annoyingly crazy stuff to get there, it was still worth it.

I feel weird endorsing this movie in the end. Normally, I would be the one calling it too obtuse to translate or too artsy to reach it's audience. But as much as I can't give it a perfect grade, Everything, Everywhere disarmed my preconceived biases. There are good performances, some insightful character development and a message that affected me as the end credits started to roll. Everything won't be a movie I revisit over and over again but it was a unique experience that I'm going to remember both for it's most bizarre and it's most touching moments. Based on it's quality, I'd recommend this movie wholeheartedly but I have to add the disclaimer that you have to be prepared to take what Everything throws at you. It's not going to be your average couple of hours of streaming content, it'll be both better and more memorable.",8
3 April 2022,Insanely Good! (I never leave a review but this film needs to be watched!),"Its as if Rick and Morty's interdimensional cable and The Matrix fell in love and birthed a heartfelt arthouse sci-fi film baby.... ....and it's AMAZING.

I hope this movie is as commercially successful as it is critically acclaimed because it deserves it. And Hollywood needs to invite more bizarre ideas and bold filmmakers like this to make more creative works on the regular.

There's no way to accurately describe it in words and do it justice.

It's something new...which is refreshing in a sea of reboots and rehashed ideas.

It dares to be different, and earnest, and silly, and vulgar, and genuine...all at the right moments and often all at the same time.

Remember that incredible dream you had one time but can't fully explain to everyone how it made you feel because it defies words?!

Well here it is on screen! You just need to go and WATCH IT!!",10
14 August 2022,Not as Good as I Hoped,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

9 April 2022,Shockingly incredible film,"Went in expecting a great film, and even with those high expectations, I was completely blown away. I laughed hysterically, tears welled in my eyes, even the action (though not always perfect) was excellent.

Everyone should see this movie as soon as you can (safely of course).

26 August 2022,It must've been a hell of an editing team.,"It almost feels like this movie had a little bit of everything, it touches your life, gives you happiness, gives you sadness, gives you power, gives you hope and takes you into the arms like nobody ever did. A story should be told in a way that anyone can accept.

Been watching movies all the time but there are few such movies that can stay with you forever and I think my memory has today saved this movie.

People who are more enthusiastic about space and physics for that matter would have loved the even more i hope so as I did too.

The strings that it touched in my brain is incredible. I went on a trip to my childhood and came back to present with this movie and I hope I have learned a big lesson of life through this movie and that is to be kind and love those who love you.

17 May 2022,"A fun if overstuffed ride, sausages included!","When it comes to almost universal praise, 2022 breakout hit Everything Everywhere All at Once is in a league of its own when you consider that audiences alongside critics from across the globe have bandied together to hail Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's (aka Daniels) mind-melting experience an instant classic, a feature that once more confirms originality in the film industry is not in fact dead and dormant, in an age where arguments have been made that cinemas are now all about Marvel and comic creations, not content as loaded and downright insane as what we have here.

With a swell of support in all forms, having finally had the chance to enter the darkened cinema and partake in what Daniels has in store for viewers (an oddness that is familiar to anyone that's seen their previous films), I can see why and how Everything has become the sensation it has been and credit where credit is due with the film managing such tricky feats as making us care for subtitled rocks or people sporting sausages for fingers, while also giving industry veteran Michelle Yeoh a role that she will long be remembered for and a chance at Oscar glory while also providing a grand re-entry to the big screen for 80's child acting legend Ke Huy Quan but as the age old saying goes, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.

Clocking in at over two hours and taking place almost exclusively in a coin operated laundry and an IRS office building, despite its many detours and snippets of other worlds and lives of our main trio, Everything is unquestionably unique and unlike anything you've ever seen before (trust me there are things here you can never un-see) but once its end game becomes apparent and you become overtly aware at its messaging and its running jokes, the films almost endlessly proceeding finale that literally spans a good 30 - 40 minutes ensures the films enthusiastic momentum and relentless energy that is so fantastic early begins to become more of a chore rather than a pleasure to sit through.

Like a good party that overstays its welcome, Daniels could've easily packaged up their narrative and the procession of slow-mo action set pieces or repetitive ruminations on the pointlessness of life that is overridden by the love and friendships we can hold close to our hearts into a much more bullet like whole, one that would've pierced the heartstrings faster and more effectively as they look to take viewers on a surprisingly emotional journey that maintains that this film is much more than adult orientated jokes, inventive violence and concepts that don't hold up to much further scrutiny.

Regardless of the fact, this wildly imaginative film (one could argue almost too imaginative with countless ideas and scenarios getting little breathing time in amongst the many varied angles the film takes) gets bogged down the further it runs in circles and messaging, there's an abundance of visual joy, sensory overload and good will towards characters that makes Daniel's film one that would be one impossible not to appreciate in one way or another.

Whether you look at the film as a straight up comedy, one with dramatic depth tackling life's big questions or one that just reveals in its immaturity, Everything is something no matter where you look and one that clearly has hit a chord with audiences crying out for a feature that goes for broke trying to be incomparable to anything else available to consume.

Final Say -

With wild imagination, inventiveness and charm, Everything Everywhere All at Once provides us with what is likely to be the most out there and playful feature film of the year and while it loses steam in a notable way past the three quarter mark, this energetically directed and brilliantly acted oddity stands out in a big way from a marketplace dominated by familiar offerings.

3 1/2 fanny packs out of 5.

23 September 2023,Huh?,"I just lasted 20 minutes. Yeah is such a good actress, as the first few minutes showed, I thought that even with a silly plot it might be watchable. No chance. It's a pity she's reduced to this drivel. Why is beating up on security personnel trying to do their job funny? Incomprehensible. I'm now one of those old people asking ""What place is this? Where are we now?"" Why is this even in theaters, let alone an Academy awards winner? Are the young now so impatient that any scene that lasts more than seven seconds now considered boring? So happy this was on Kanopy and I didn't have to shell out for it.

15 March 2023,Everything Everywhere All at Once deserved all the praise it got!,"After months of Hype, I finally watched this on an airplane flight on Philippines Airlines from The Philippines to San Francisco. It was such a melange of images and various storylines that were either real or not (or maybe they all were) that it was a fascinating watch, that's for sure! Funny and touching and adventurous all over, it was quite an enjoyable ride. Great to see Michelle Yeoh (who I knew from Tomorrow Never Dies, Crouching Tiger-Hidden Dragon, and Crazy Rich Asians), Ke Huy Quan (previously a kid in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, The Goonies, and a short-lived family TV show called ""Together We Stand""), Jamie Lee Curtis (no need to cite what's she's known for), James Hong (I found out he was in something I've seen him in, Flower Drum Song), and Stephanie Hsu (this one might be the first time I've her in something) all in this one! They all were excellent in their multiple roles and the three of them that won deserved the Oscars they got. As did the directors and all the other technical categories. But while I'm glad this won Best Picture, I actually wanted another movie in that category to win, Elvis, which is what I'll review next on this site.",9
1 May 2022,Greatest movie of all time,"I have no business writing a review about a movie this good. I went with 2 friends, one that's a movie buff and another that didn't even want to see it. By the end we were all sobbing and agreed this is the best movie we've ever seen. Don't watch a trailer. Don't even read this review. Go watch it please and enjoy the laughs, cries, set design, costumes, and incredible acting. 10/10 across the board.

6 June 2022,An Unique And Memorable Experience,"This is a movie like no other before. It has a truly unique story which starts of with a tax audit and ends up in places you never could imagined. Visually stunning, funny script, some great action pieces, wonderfully acted, superbly edited and creative from start to the end. One of the best movies of 2022 for sure and a film that surely will go down as one the most memorable films in the last decade.

16 May 2022,Unnecessarily LONG and Over-Edited,"The film is basically two hours of long, drawn out slow motion effects. That is NOT an exaggeration.

I sat in the theatre asking my boyfriend what the time was because it kept jumping into slow motion so unnecessarily. It literally could have been a 90 minute film, but it's basically two hours of slow motion and colours and minimal story. It's all about the slow motion.

I was more engaged when they were in the laundromat telling the normal story and lost interest as soon as the film became all exposition from Short Round and all the slow motion Kung Fu that took way too long.

Disengaging as hell.

10 May 2022,Perfectly executed,"Spoiler free review- Visually stunning, just the right amounts of just about every film genre... every. Film. Genre. Hahahaha! The comedy was outstanding and the entire cast pulls off even the most ridiculous of it. This film is very enjoyable on the big screen and it doesn't take itself too seriously which makes it that much better.

17 May 2023,Looks nice,"So , Everything Everywhere all at once...Yeah it looks nice but feels like I'm watching a music video that goes on and on and somebody is having fun with the visual effects.. Good if that's what you're into but I wasn't expecting that.. The comedy is also very cheesy.. I found myself laughing a few times but that was mainly at how stupid it was.. Surprised it won the awards.. The actors all do a decent enough job for what they were given.

It's hard to see this becoming known as a classic I certainly won't be rushing to recommend it to anyone or watch it again myself... But I can see why others might enjoy it..

16 April 2022,"Poignant, unique, fun, interesting, heartfelt - a must-see!","'Everything Everywhere All At Once' is a simple story about a family's search for meaning. It also happens to be a mind-bending, multiple-universe, kung-fu, sci-fi epic! Evelyn (Yeoh) and her husband Waymond (Quan - Short Round from 'Temple of Doom'!) run a laundromat and have some issues with their marriage, their daughter Joy (Hsu) and Evelyn's father, Gong Gong (Hong). What starts out as a family drama doesn't take long to turn into a fight to save the multiverse when another Waymond shows up to enlist Evelyn's help.

From the directors of 'Swiss Army Man', ""the Daniels"" sure know how to do surreal well, but make sure there's plenty of laughs and idiosyncratic comedy. The alternate realities are explained quickly and simply - no time is wasted and the plot and action is always moving along. Yeoh, Hsu and Quan are all great, as is Jamie Lee Curtis in her role(s). Yeoh should get extra credit both for the stunts/fights at her age (it is 20 years since 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'!), as well as pulling off both a martial arts expert and boring housewife at once.

While there's plenty of bonkers thing going on - Hsu's costumes are excellent, some hilarious sex jokes, great/unexpected use of ""Absolutely (Story of a Girl)""- the heart of the film is the relationship between Evelyn & Joy and Evelyn & Waymond. There's some sad moments and some beautiful ones, especially the quiet desert scenes, but we're left with a great underlying message of love and kindness giving the world meaning.",8
21 May 2022,Wish it would have been 30 mins shorter,"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)

From the creators of LSD, DMT and other tripping narcotics comes a weirdness bonanza that crosses boundaries between comedy, action and sci fi. The enjoyment of this film will come down to how much you are willing to suspend control, strap in and plunge into the madness. For the first hour or so, I was thoroughly loving the ride as I admired the multiverse execution, laughed and even pondered some philosophical elements. Then came a level of saturation as I had my fill of weirdness but the ride was still continuing; only I wasn't enjoying it anymore.

The film is about a middle-aged woman trying to make peace with her life choices and the miserable situation she ended up in. In another life, she could have been a singer, chef or even an actress and on the way to filing her taxes, she gets a chance to experience all those possibilities... at the same time. Michelle Yeoh makes this film work thanks to her diverse skillset ranging from martial arts to emotional sensitivity. Jamie Lee Curtis was another standout with the mannerisms and maniacal facial expressions.

The chaotic nature of the film blends ridiculousness, Jackie Chan action and comedy which you might find enjoyable depending on your taste. The creativity is next level but as the film progresses, many of the elements begin to look weird for the sake of weirdness. The creators layered the story with philosophical and nihilistic elements but it's hard to pay attention to them when you have a chubby girl with a pig fighting people with dildos. It is also a parody of movies like Kill Bill, Ratatouille and others but instead of paying homage, it looks like one of the Scary Movies.

Narrative-wise, they skillfully managed to present a complex topic in a digestible manner while integrating impressive action and humor. There was supposedly some emotion in it, but the lackluster pacing with 5 climaxes spawning endless new cycles diluted any semblance of heart, causing the actual ending to feel unsatisfactory. It is definitely a fun movie that people should see because of its unique premise and cool nature, I just don't understand why is everyone worshipping it.

28 February 2023,The emperor's new clothes,"This much lauded hotchpotch of absurdist humour and narrative chaos starts out promisingly by introducing us to a Chinese-American family who run a laundromat and are being audited by the IRS. Once we meet the IRS inspector Deirdre (wonderfully played by Jamie Lee Curtis), the film launches its concept of several simultaneously existing multiverses, and how our protagonists have learned to jump between them in order to fight that eternal battle between good and evil. Welcome to another childish toying with simple superhero themes and antagonisms.

Although the filmmakers Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known collectively as the ""Daniels"") do exhibit some visual creativity, all of the film's originality lies in the influx of images, atmospheres, and colours, not in its fiddling with philosophical or narrative concepts. The film's endless clashes, verse-jumps and attempts at explaining itself make this a longwinded and meandering experience. And the repetitive fights, which in all fairness make up most of the film's running time, are overchoreographed and unorganic. They never feel like happening to or having anything to do with human beings - and thus end up feeling irrelevant. Instead, Everything Everywhere All at Once becomes a martial arts extravaganza for the less athletically inclined - in a giddy, self-regulating movie world where you can jump between (uni)verses and deploy magically trained versions of yourself for various seemingly brainstormed purposes, with endless access to eccentric costumes and flickering projections.

Everything Everywhere may seem ambitious and complex - mostly just for the sake of it - but it never is emotionally or narratively. There is such a laziness hidden in the film's onrush of imagery that you're likely to be offended by it - unless, of course, you let yourself be impressed by the emperor's new clothes. And the attempted comedy which is scattered around here and there resembles that of the National Lampoon movies from the 80s and 90s - which were mostly lambasted to an extent that Everything Everywhere also should have been. One highlight: A silent conversation between two rocks in a desert.",2
25 April 2022,How clever can being silly be?,"It's an American trend, goofy lighthearted comedies carrying on their shoulders deep thoughts and delve into real philosophical issues. I already mentioned this trend when I wrote about Free Guy, though in that case these were philosophical issues straight out of the text book, while Everything Everywhere All at Once has thrown all text books away or maybe even burned them - in the best way. It is, as already been said by other reviewers one of the most original scripts ever written, as irreverent as they come. They push pure sci fi ideas deep into the realm of the absurd not to say plain stupid, without ever being stupid. In my opinion the stupidity or silliness is here in order to neutralize what would be otherwise sappy cliche, or borderline preachiness if said straightforwardly. This is so cleverly done the writing is almost genius - a term I don't often use. But it's the second bright film I see in a single month dealing with how destructive motherly love can be and how it's the only cure of its destructiveness, and I speak obviously about Turning Red who also chose the humorous approach but didn't go as far as EEAaO dared to go.

This called for an entire cast of superlative performances starting with Michelle Yeoh who's a brilliant actress that I never saw in a role I didn't like. Same is true for Ke Huy Quan whom I didn't see since the Goonies in anything, what a waste, such an amazing actor with so few roles to his credit. Also brilliant are Stephanie Hsu Jamie Lee Curtis sinking her teeth into another juicy role and James Hong as Gong Gong for whom I'll always have a warm place in my heart since his role in Big Trouble in Little China.

Bottom line: the creative team of the Daniels, as they like to call themselves has very little fear and steps without hesitation where others wouldn't dare looking. But they do it with style and wisdom that remind me of the very best. I'll be looking forward to their next creation. If you want to see motherhood deconstructed, to its core; if you want to find out about the amazing power of being nice, without ever risking an overdose of sugarcoating - this your film.",9
23 January 2023,Bizarrely Beautiful,"This movie was chaotic and even annoying at times. It will turn some people off for sure. But it still allows us to feel our own personal chaos and reflect on our relationships. These are close relationships, and even obligatory distant ones like the bureaucrat that frustrates you to the point of near madness.

The enormity of everything is ridiculous. We are ridiculous too, of course. Responding to hostility with kindness is not in our nature.

Fantastic performances all around, most notably Ke Huy Quan (Waymond) and Stephanie Hsu (Joy). Waymond symbolized the heart of this movie and Joy the turmoil. It was great seeing Quan, who had to be one of the greatest child actors ever on the big screen (The Goonies, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) return and claim his stardom like his co-star Michelle Yeoh. Hsu killed it from start to finish. Jamie Lee Curtis kills it too.

The essence of the Chinese family worked here for me, they represent humanity colorfully and fantastically. These, and other thoughtful details throughout this wild trip make it evident that the writer/director team of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert are confident and on top of their craft, blending visual elements of the absurd and those with great depth. Swiss Army Man is a great example of this. What will they create next?",8
13 May 2022,When Matrix meets Monty Python meets Crouching Tiger - and sausages!,"This is a masterpiece. Definitely the most interesting, entertaining, and mind-bending piece of movie magic in recent years. You'll laugh, cringe, watch in awe and definitely feel something.

You have seen a thousand movies? You think you have seen everything? Well, think again. Everything Everywhere All at Once of course takes ideas and inspiration from other movies and books, but it mixes such a refreshing blend of mind-boggling entertaiment for your heart and soul, that it's hard not to walk out of the theater with a smile on your face after the movie (if you belong to the 99% of people that will enjoy this one).

Michelle Yeoh plays the part she has been practising for the last 40 years. This is her movie. Such a powerful performance and it contains everything, every emotion, every move, every combination of interesting Chinese-English mix of words. And often time everything at once, everywhere on the screen.

And then Ke Huy Quan - where have you been for all these years? Short Round from Indiana Jones is back, with a sweet vengeance! Amazing action scenes, and such a warm presence on the screen on the quieter scenes, and definitely some humour sprinkled in.

Stephanie Hsu and James Wong and Jamie Lee Curtis are equally as good, and rest of the ever reacurring cast also do well, everyone gets opportunities to shine.

Then the action, cinematography, set desing, music, outfit design, writing, directing - all comes together in such a satisfying way that this has to be Oscar winner in many categories next year.

There are so many clever camera tricks, such well edited and original action scenes, so many weird costumes and the whole multiverse thingie is so clearly presented without it being just exposition.

And the humour - you either love it or not, but me and my friends and the whole audience did. I could go on and on about details, but see for yourself :)

And finally, the heart. In the center of it all is family, and love, to yourself and the world around you. That is the message we need in this decade.",
21 May 2022,This is what Art is,"It is quite rare that narrative techniques are not only perfectly utilised but invented for a film that does not stand upon nor shed the light on such techniques for the sake of positive critical appraisal but rather to immerse a wider range of audience ending up with some sort of family movie.

The risk lies within the fact that this could have been taken for what it really wasn't. The narrative 'mistakes' used on purpose were hit or miss, but in my opinion, work on so many levels.

It never relied on ironic humour but rather 'silly' humour which was not amusing to a lot of people. Now, my take is this was not part of a comedy bit but a meta bit. The whole movie was actually meta, referencing many sci-fi ideas commonly used and turning this from just a fun movie into much more than that, for those who are into it anyway. It was messy as Joy said; it was really weird how every adjective that could've been used to describe the narration was mentioned by someone in the movie. I'm kinda sure they did it on purpose.

A take from the story was that it's okay to be okay with silly. Silly and simple is okay sometimes and so were the jokes. A silly husband like that one may not be someone we meet every day, and those are not the random jokes expected to be in a sci film, but here we are. We understand how silly this whole situation is, we understand how silly everything is.

The movie was messy just like Joy and Evelyn but it was consistently so. It consistently delivered imperfections that were already vital takes from the story.

It could be argued that there was no specific point of climax but more like half an hour of a climax and it is a valid point but also valid for the writers to execute. They did an incredible job at delivering an experience of everything, all at once. It is what life is like after all.

This was somehow never confusing at any point which many directors could have taken an advantage of the feed those who are satisfied watching complicated non-linear storytelling but they didn't; they took the risk to take it further. They took the risk to turn it into this bagel of a project of a film.

I loved how the stories or realisations of mistakes blended in together so seamlessly. It was so many genres and ideas in one simply made and easily-understood movie. This, somehow, worked?

Profound. Tremendously relatable. Absolutely real.

This is a 10/10 not because it's perfect for perfect does not exist but because it's beyond original, it's here to revolutionalize the film industry.

4 March 2023,Love surpasses the borders of the universe,"The pace of the film is in line with the plot. We live in a troubled world, where it seems that everything has to happen now, at the same time. The idea of Daniel Kwan (director, screenwriter, and musician) of seeking help in parallel universes to solve our earthly problems is not crazy, rather it is a well-intentioned escape from that life that only brings conflicts, and each time we still entangled. A masterful performance by Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan (who I confess I thought was Jackie Chan, with a huge resemblance, especially in his martial movements). Jamie Lee Curtis, in a role that could seem secondary, shines in an incredible way, because the actress who is great, is great. In the end, the solution is easier: love breaks borders as here as in the universe.

22 February 2023,A Confusing and Emotionally Hollow Mess,"As someone who just watched ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" I have to say that I was sorely disappointed by the movie. Despite the hype and the buzz surrounding it, the film failed to live up to my expectations.

One of the main issues with the movie was that it lacked emotional resonance. Despite its ambitious story and large ensemble cast, the film failed to create a strong emotional connection with the audience. It was difficult to feel invested in the characters' journeys, making it challenging to care about their struggles and triumphs.

Additionally, the movie suffered from pacing issues. The narrative felt bloated and uneven, with some scenes dragging on for too long while others felt rushed and underdeveloped. This made it difficult to stay engaged throughout the film's runtime, which clocked in at over two hours.

Another problem with the movie was its overreliance on clich√©s and tropes. The film attempted to subvert and twist these familiar storytelling elements, but ultimately failed to do so in a meaningful way. The result was a story that felt derivative and uninspired, lacking the freshness and originality that it was striving for.

Finally, while the film's visual effects were generally impressive, there were some notable missteps. Some of the scenes were visually overwhelming, with too much happening on screen at once, which made it difficult to focus on any one thing. Additionally, some of the visual effects were distractingly cheesy, which took away from the immersive experience the film was trying to create.",6
20 January 2023,Mhs Wang are you with us,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",10
13 April 2022,I enjoyed this even though it did get too silly at times,"The movie is very Asian. The overall story arc is exploring family relations in an inter-generational family. Between daughter and mother, husband and wife, (grand)father and daughter. Expectations, disappointments, maybe lack of expressing love and emotion, all play a part in this film. It's framed in a sci-fi/fantasy thriller, that overall, doesn't QUITE make sense. I guess the director, who previously did the oddball Swiss Army Man, wasn't content with doing a straight up drama.

I am leaning to the belief that what happens is more of a construct of Michelle Yeoh's identity crisis as she reaches a crossroads in her life and her business. She escapes into the alternate reality to process her feelings and emotions for everything. That's the only thing that makes sense to me anyway.

The action was decent, but it's not the focal point of this film. There are scenes with fights, some really well done. There are some groan worthy moments, sexual innuendos during the fights, and so on. But overall, they're somewhat straight forward fight scenes. I guess Dan Kwan took some inspiration from the over the top CGI comedy of Stephen Chow's action films like Kung Fu Hustle.

I'm not sure if this film resonates with non-asians. They might not relate to the cold, judging motherly character of Michelle Yeoh, and not understand why she is distant with her daughter. But judging from all the positive reviews, it sounds like it has appealed to a wide audience.

Everyone does a great job in their roles. I can't believe James Hong is still acting. He's several years ago away from being 100 years old. And great to see 'short round' Ke Huy Quan in a movie. His voice hasn't changed much since his child acting days lol. The actress who played the daughter was also really good. And of course Michelle Yeoh sells the character, and all the alternate universe versions.

At 2 hours, the movie flies pretty good. There were some moments that were silly, and probably could have been shortened or left out, like the rocks and pinata moments. Otherwise, an entertaining film.",7
17 January 2023,Hands down best movie of 2022,"What can I say about this movie. It is funny, action packed, dramatic, emotional, ridiculous, and just plain fun. Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan absolutely dominate in the leading roles of this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as well. I cannot say enough for this movie. I went into it thinking it would be another fine movie because of the reviews but came out of it just blown away by the story, the acting, and the directing. I can't think of one thing wrong with this movie. It is so emotional and funny while being so engaging. This one will be an instant classic that I hope will be watched for generations. I've watched it 5 times and it has jumped into my top 3 movies I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, please take some time to watch it. You won't be disappointed.

8 September 2022,Between a sentimental rock and a thousand hard places,"You remember that observation that someone with a fancy car was usually compensating for ""something"" or shall we say, a lack of something?... I feel I could apply that to this film, but the fancy car in this films case is a stylish cinematic visual orgy, and what's being compensated for is (imo) the ability to visually and creatively convey human truth and touch the human heart. They tried, they really did, but it's similar to people who overindulge on self-help lifestyles, and throw every bit of hypocritical guru advice, 'spiritual' workshop, buddhist mantras, Alan Watts diatribe and the garden ornaments with the kitchen sink thrown in for good measure, it's just too much to the point the core of the intention is lost in the superfluous, crushed in the mass volume of input.

This film has so much going on, that in places and at times it creates a sensory input overload, and by the time the lovely sweet, almost gushy but very meaningful beautiful message of finding love in the mundane and those around us, myself and I feel others who have watched this who saw through the glitz and glamour are left with a cinematic experience of a film who's heart suffers from existential density. It is dense because of the amount of matter shoved into a heart shaped chocolate box, filled with concrete.

Let me suddenly shift things a bit, not unlike the films visual style... I have been a fan of Michelle Yeoh since Police Story 3. One of my favourite films I have seen her in is ""Sunshine"", which I think is highly underrated. She shined in that movie, even though it wasn't a major part for her, it really showed her talent in a short space of screen time. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a beautiful experience, imo was the highlight of her career, a delicate but stoic performance underlining a powerful presence and impressive physicality and martial ability when not being played by a stunt-woman. With EEAAO, I'm so glad someone gave her a chance at centre stage, and throughout this film she was a pleasure to watch. But for me the real gem of this movie was Ke Huy Quan. It took me maybe 15 minutes to finally realise, ""Hey that's the kid from The Goonies!"". His performance actually managed to pierce my heart. This shows also a very well written character, which shows me 'The Daniels' can write impressive insightful screenplay, half the time at least. I feel the same about this movie as I do with their prior film, ""Swiss Army Man"", a mixed bag oddity of beautiful humanitarian concepts and deep social commentary and an interesting probe into the less visited parts of the human psyche, whilst simultaneously grappling with perverse visual humour and sickly gushy sentimentality. The same could be said of EEAAO, but the perverse over the top visual humour is toned down for most of the film, but still rears (excuse the pun) it's ugly head in the form of a giant dildo being used as a martial arts weapon, a scene where Michelle Yeoh is dressed as an adult baby and red substance is squirted on her as if mimicking blood which I found quite disturbing and completely unnecessary for any plot development and character unravelling, and lovers with sausage wieners for fingers which when bitten into leaked and squirted mayonnaise or custard or god knows what everywhere. To me, these things are perverse and disgusting, and just seem to be two guys with some warped fetishes getting their fix from sneaking this stuff into their movie (but hey maybe I shouldn't be so surprised, this is Hollywood we're talking about, I'm sure everything is normal about Hollywood social cliques these days). There is a lot of unnecessary things in this movie, including the reference to Wong Kar Wai's movie ""In the Mood for Love"" and similar, as much as it's nice to give a visual nod to their inspirations/role models, they seem to forget they have a story to tell. By this point in the 3rd act of the movie it was dragging on.... Much like my review.

It's a visually impressive movie when it's not shoving things up it's own a**, but takes too long to get to it's most rewarding point. Great performances by all actors involved, some inspiring moments both visually and emotively, but overall a cluster pluck of mostly needless martial arts cliches and what seems to be a ridiculous competition to see how far jokes and meaning can be pushed before it all becomes meaningless. Yeah, the rocks were cute and funny, but by this point, I wanted a landslide to come along and push them to the end of the movie.",6
29 January 2023,Poppycock,"All the other reviewers have said it.

Dialogue: superficial, pretentious, ludicrous, trying to sound wise and philosophical but failing miserably.

Acting: ok but sometimes felt like a lot of mindless reading of lousy dialogue (see above).

Comedy: childish and doesn't make any sense 90% of the time.

Story: going around in circles and getting nowhere. More plot holes than a sieve.

Premise: done and done and over done. Some say take it lightly, but how can we when they are so serious about relationships and quantum mechanics and the universe, while in the next breath they don't seem to understand how evolution works or how sausages are made. Like I say, poppycock.

A friend of mine said it has a nice message about mental health and depression. What a very subtle way to tell a story. Give the director an Oscar for most lurid movie ever. If this was a cartoon or anime or whatever you wanna call it, I'd give it a 4 for effort. But as it is, it doesn't deserve more than 2 stars.",1

7 May 2022,Best movie I've seen in over a decade,"A great film, the type of heartfelt magical film that had a brief period in the early 2000's, when he had movies like I Heart Huckabee's and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind. Filled with imagination, humor in a film that takes on the popular theme of multiple universes but makes it better than any other film.

11 July 2023,"Something New, Something Original, Something Creative, Something Out of this Universe!!!","A lot of reviews seem to place this movie in a chaotic premise. I did not have trouble at all understanding this film. I am actually shocked that someone actually thought of a new idea, FINALLY! Furthermore, it is a sci-fi comedy, which we don't see a lot of these days.

The movie itself is a lot of fun. It is based on traveling to alternate realities, by doing something that you would never normally do. You could then get gifts from the alternate reality, physical or mental. It was overwhelming at first, but I started to understand about 1/4 through.

It's a fast paced movie, and never gets boring. It strives on everything from utterly ridiculous to serious and tedious short term plots.

You definitely won't get bored with this movie. It's quite intense. I would recommend giving this movie a watch. You'll have a CRAZY fun time.

9/10.",9
13 March 2023,Great movie and especially what we needed now,"For me it has special meaning coming out of a different country. At first I was afraid it would be hard to understand and fortunately it changed to English pretty quickly. The actors are all clearly top notch.

I am glad Jamie Lee Curtis was in it. She does the US proud. It was nice to see the famous actress, Michelle Yeoh, who played Eleanor in ""Crazy Rich Asians"" commanding the lead because she is clearly really versatile A movie like this can do more to heal the world than all the nuclear weapons in the world.

Let's keep up the good work film industry!

I hope we see more movies about understanding beyond the length of our noses!

4 March 2023,Confused by the confusion,"I don't understand how people found this movie confusing. Knowing this was a multiverse movie I was expecting it to be very heavy and cerebral, full of convoluted plot twists and turns. This movie wasn't that at all. There were no elaborate timelines or endless characters you needed to keep track of. The means of jumping through universes was straightforward and the motivations of the few main characters were easy to understand. I was actually pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a multiverse story but instead got a love story and I'm all for it.

I thought the movie was clever, visually beautiful, utterly absurd and genuinely heartwarming. It won't appeal to everyone but some people are just no fun.

30 April 2022,"Loads of fun, way too long, finally got around to it's message","I'm not going to join the chorus of those getting huge thigh sweats for this movie. It has it's good and not so good points. Yes, it's a wild ride. Very inventive. Good acting. Good action sequences. Amazing editing (should win an award just for that). But sheesh, it's so damn unnecessarily long.

It could have been 110 minutes and told the same story. It's way too self-indulgent. Scenes drag on and on and provide no additional clarity to the plot. It seems like the filmmakers just wanted to include everything they shot regardless of whether it moved the story along. If the film had been more succinct and got to the main point of the mother-daughter relationship, I would have enjoyed it much more. It was like, 'Let's bombard the audience with absurdity. Throw in lots of butt plugs and dildos etc. Oh wait, we need to make it profound. No worries, we have 30 more minutes'.

The length of this movie was it's biggest fault. Plus squeezing the 'message' in the finale seemed like an afterthought (it wasn't, it was just made to feel that way).

I started the film feeling disengaged. Then it made me angry. Then I struggled to stay awake (seriously). Finally the 'message' roused me. It wasn't a particularly profound message for me personally but at least it was there.

Oh, and I believe much of the excitement about this film is also because it references other movies. Cinephiles, critics and the film industry loveys adore seeing these insider jokes on screen.",6
26 March 2022,A Result Of Tedious And Meticulous Teamwork,"10/10, almost no flaw.

Once, I thought that my head will explode while I enduring this movie. I mean, I think this is the most awesome movie I saw in 2022 so far!

Datuk Michelle Yeoh, simply put, Amazing. Outstanding performance.

Perhaps, this is her best performance yet & could win her a couple of film awards this year.

I mean, after two hours the credit scene rolls - I still can't stop thinking about the whole movie.

This movie is not just about art, but to me it felt like a masterpiece that comes out from a dedicated and harworking team.

The casts are perfect. The storyline and plots were more entertaining than I what bargained for. The memorable scripts, the outstanding CGI, the brilliant fighting scene, the awesome-awesome costumes and the small-small jokes scattered throughout the whole movie - it's a movie that I can watch over and over and over again & will not get bored.

This movie stood up differently, unlike most recent ones.

This movie is not overhyped. It is; Everything Everywhere All At Once.

Hats off to Datuk Michelle Yeoh & the team for their hard works and effort.

10/10 - hands down, and that's an understatement.",10
29 March 2023,That many awards?,"It's interesting to see nihilism in a movie but for me it was like a 5 year old child making a ""joke"" and then the adult doing a weak laugh so that the child doesn't feel bad.

The family dynamic was weird but actually interesting to see and the really boring dad fight scene was GREAT (it's not boring) however you might be able to ignore my review because I stopped watching, I wasn't interested. It was just too weird and I know the best things in art, music and everything else might be weird at first (a cascade of melting clocks or dissonance ""sent from hell"" in the early days of western music) but it was just weird with some small funny ideas (bagel) and some stupid hot dog fingers.

This is NOT 7+/10 IMDb material.

13 March 2023,7 Oscars? Really?,"This film is quite stupid and illogical. I am pretty sure that most people are too afraid to admit they don't understand it. It's like with ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Everyone can see the Emperor has no clothes on, but by revealing their knowledge they are afraid that everyone else will believe they are stupid. I am the little boy spontaneously shouting that the Emperor is naked. Also, please notice that I watch the last half an hour of the film at double speed. That's how boring the film is. Finally, I do wonder how many of the jury's members actually watched this movie?! That said, this isn't the first time some weird inconceivable movie has won an Oscar.

19 May 2022,Absurdist Filmmaking At Its Anarchic Best,"An unabashedly fun & unapologetically entertaining roller coaster ride of emotions that invites its viewers on a whirlwind adventure through spacetime without losing sight of its emotional trajectory and leaves them in an overwhelming state of sensory overload, Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the most intriguing, imaginative & impressive concepts to surface on the big screen in recent years and is masterly steered by a fantabulous performance from the legendary Michelle Yeoh.

Written & directed by Daniel Scheinert & Daniel Kwan (collectively known as Daniels), the simple idea behind the film's premise is of a parent not understanding their kid and how the divide from it can at times threaten the fabric of a family. Daniels start the story right by acquainting us with the characters and switch to next gear only after the family dynamic is established and a strong foundation is already paved. But once the multiverse aspect kicks into action, Daniels unleash a limitless assault on the senses with absolute liberation.

The plot traverses endless possibilities, navigating from one universe to another with jumps that never allow the audience to settle down and keeps them invested in the proceedings with smart, surreal & spirited storytelling that mashes every genre into a rapturous, rambunctious delight to deliver the mind-boggling goods. Jam-packed with surprises & overflowing with acid-trip energy, it's not that everything hits the sweet spot but the story also never discards its boisterous vibe & core values. And then, there is Michelle Yeoh who steals the show with an exceptional showcase.

Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is rightly described as a swirl of genre anarchy and is one of the finest stories about multiverses, existentialism, nihilism & intergenerational divide. It is chaotic yet cohesive, bizarre yet accessible, ridiculous yet evocative and thrilling yet thoughtful. As endearing as it is emotionally resonant, Daniels' sophomore effort establishes the duo as a force to be reckoned with and is absurdist filmmaking at its anarchic best. A powerhouse of originality, imagination & slapdash ingenuity that makes an essential plea for love, compassion & kindness in times of bitter conflict, this inter-dimensional odyssey is one for the ages.",
23 April 2022,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year, warranting the clickbait ""you've never seen anything like this"".","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)

""Everything Everywhere All at Once is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year, finally putting Daniels on the mainstream radar.

With such a low budget, it's almost humiliating that so many expensive Hollywood blockbusters can't even reach the heels of so much originality, imagination, excitement, and emotion. Michelle Yeoh leads the troops in a film that also pays homage to the iconic career of the actress who, at 59 years old, accompanies the fantastic stunt team in truly outlandish fights.

The mother-daughter relationship as the emotional core of the story follows a surprisingly predictable path and needs a few more dialogues to deliver an even more powerful climax, but it still induces tears and a genuine sense of concern for the characters.

Technically, all the elements are so creatively unique that it warrants the clickbait ""you've never seen anything like this"".

See it in theaters!""

Rating: A.",9
28 February 2023,Wow! Just Wow!,"This movie is split up into three chapters, almost like a Wes Anderson film or Zack Synder's Justice League. This first chapter was enjoyable even though to me it made no sense. The movie really lived up to its title because everything was happening everywhere all at once! Then the second chapter though literally made me cry, it was emotional, relatable, heck even laughable at times, and yet everything happened everywhere all at once but it then all connected and made sense. The villain was great, the whole cast also did great and although Top Gun Maverick should win best picture, I wouldn't be upset if this ended up winning instead.

10 July 2023,"An instant classic, and one of the greatest films ever made.","Evelyn Wang's life is falling apart.

Her marriage has lost its passion, her relationship with her daughter is strained, and the laundromat she runs with her husband is being audited.

And from this simple framework, we get a film that pulls out all the stops and becomes more and more insane before pulling the rug out from under you and revealing itself to be a simple story about love, optimism, and googly eyes.

This is a watershed movie. Like Pulp Fiction did in the 1990s, EEAAO has come along to remind us that big budgets, all-star casts and mega-studio backing is nothing compared to imagination and passion. And there are very few movies with as much imagination and passion as this.

This is a movie that could've only been made today. It's a perfect mix of modern technology and old-fashioned ingenuity. It couldn't have happened without digital editing but with its minimal budget, it works wonders.

And at the center of it all is Michelle Yeoh, reminding us all that ""past your prime"" is a myth. She gets to show off every single one of her many talents, from dance and martial arts to subtle and not-so-subtle humor. She's absolute dynamite. And while she is unquestionably the star of the film, Ke Huy Quan is the heart and soul. It's a comeback performance on the level of Robert Downey, Jr. In Iron Man. And on top of both of these excellent performances, we also get brilliant from from Stephanie Hsu, James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis. It's a treasure trove of great acting.

I could go on and on forever about this movie. It's a game changer and a life changer. It reminded me why I fell in love with movies in the first place, and in an industry full of unnecessary live-action remakes and endless superhero spin-offs and sequels, EEAAO is in a class all its own. An absolute masterpiece, and my new favorite film of all time.",10
8 March 2023,"An Example of Quantity over Quality, but Entertaining","Okay, i have mixed views on this. I have Amazon Prime and surfing for a movie yesterday i saw that this was included with subscription. So me and my partner watched it for the first time.

It started out slow but i'm patient so that didn't bother me, then when the quirky editing and hyper characters started it did start to get interesting. Although only for a short while, it unfortunately for me started to get daft to the point i'm like ""Where is this going? Hotdogs for hands, Bagel black holes? Characters wanting to shove items up there bottoms?"" I mean.....yeah?

Somewhat throughout the movie i felt exhausted, it was like the movie was written in bullet points. ""What weird edit can we do next, with what weird costume?""

The acting was great, all the main cast were great but the movie had elements of complete random madness that make you sit there scratching your head with a nervous giggle as to ask it's relevance.

Acting: 9/10 Editing: 8/10 Story: 6/10

I enjoyed the movie but i feel at the same time that they over did it.

Just seen that it won 7 Oscars, i think it should have taken 1 or 2 maybe but not 7 and especially not Best Picture. It just shows it won on hype alone other than substance. I would have agreed to it taking 7 Oscars if the friggin story made more sense. At one point you had a guy in the background humping a lamp shade, yep that won Best Picture.",8

It was not the movie of the year as some say, nor the complete mess as others argue. I think it was somewhere in between. I was intrigued throughout the lengthy piece but often wondering if it's going anywhere. I have mixed feelings about it and would rather watch something ""normal"" next, as much as I loved the talking rocks!

11 May 2022,A creative masterpiece with heart,"I absolutely loved this film and yet, nearly missed it because of the trailer.

The plot is simple enough: There's a big bad going around destroying different worlds in the multiverse. The alpha-members from one of the best worlds out there track down a woman who they believe is the key to defeating the evil once and for all.

From there, things get very weird. Honestly I don't want to go into the film too much because I would sooner people watch it without knowing anything but everything about this film was pitch perfect: performances, writing, the laughs, the fights, the music. I have never felt such feelings when watching a film and I'm not sure I will again.

This film is a must see on the big screen.

19 September 2023,things I liked in the movie and things I didn't like.,"A Chinese immigrant lives in America and embarks on a crazy and strange adventure in multiple universes. This movie should be called the multiverse of madness. The things that were written in ""Doctor Strange 2"" I saw in this movie in terms of the worlds, the characters, and the strange things that happen.

Critics expressed their admiration for this film and it won the admiration of many, but from my point of view, yes, it was enjoyable, but the duration of the movie was unpleasant and long for me. There is a good message in the movie, which is an atmosphere that contains a rush about oneself and how important we are in this universe, at the same time you discover that you aren't important in this universe.

There is a strong emotional factor in the movie, which is the story of a mother with her daughter and the love of the family, but the film sometimes took unexpected comedic paths and was affected by the emotional factor. At the same time, there are things that are supposed to be funny and they actually made many viewers of the film laugh, but at the same time you see Some of the comedy scenes were disgusting and nauseating.

The movie is special and it is one of the best good movies you will see in 2022, but at the same time the movie needed a better balance in terms of comedy and drama in a way that summarizes this is similar to the movie The Matrix, which is a person who can enter another world through his mind. Here you see the idea is similar, but in multiple universes, and you see these multiple universes and you see the options.

This movie makes you think about your personal decisions and makes you think that there are people like you, but in other universes they made decisions that affected you. Here this idea is creative, but what bothered me was the comedic situations at the wrong time. There are emotional scenes that were touching. Great dialogue scenes, but they were damaged by the comedy because sometimes the movie Reminds me of Marvel movies.

The cinematography, editing, and music were wonderful, which was an essential factor in the film's story. The scene of the rocks was eye-catching, wonderful, deep and poignant, but at the same time the director decided to show this story and how he used somewhat disgusting comedic tools. It was something for me that was inappropriate and inappropriate.

Yes, I know that this movie has Hollywood agendas, and this is a large part that contributed to it receiving very high and fabulous ratings, but in general, there are things I liked in the movie and things I didn't like.",6
6 November 2022,Forced my family to finish this movie and we all regetted it,"We thought the movie was almost over, hit pause and realized we were only 45 minutes into it! This movie feels like 5 hours of torture. My family wanted to shut it off, but I convinced them we should finish it with the hope it will get better (and heck, I paid $6 for it). It doesn't get better. ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a chaotic, stupid, self-indulgent, mess that has no respect for the needs of the viewer. When the movie was over, my wife turned to me with an intense expression and said ""That is the WORST movie I have EVER seen!"" I'm actually angry that this movie currently has an 8.1 rating. It is my sincere advice to not waste your time and money on this movie.

--- Jan. 26, 2023 Update --- This movie got 11 Oscar nominations. The Oscars needs to be careful here. If EEAAO wins multiple Oscars, this could have a negative impact on movie ticket sales. Other movie makers will start to copy EEAAO and then the movie industry will become disconnected with their audience. The movie going audience will lose patience with random and chaotic movies and just stop paying movie theaters prices. I'm glad I only paid $6 to rent this movie. If I paid $30 for two tickets and then another $30 for snacks, I would have been angry and probably would steer away from the movie going experience. The Oscars should not reward what many people are saying is the worst movie they have ever seen.

--- March 13, 2023 Update --- So EEAAO cleaned up with 7 Oscars. The Acadamy Awards have really jeopardized their reputation by awarding this terd. They should be embarrassed. It tells me the Acadamy Awards do not understand the craft of filmmaking as an art form. They should understand that a great film tells a human relatable story that connects with the viewer in some meaningful way. EEAAO is random, chaotic, garbage. Not even 1% of what a best picture should be. I would love to get a candid response from Spielberg about what he thinks about EEAAO winning best director and best picture; two awards that ""The Fabelmans"" was in direct competition with. Spielberg is a master of the film art form and knows how to tell a story. I would think he would feel invalidated.

This is a sad day for me because I no longer trust the Acadamy Awards and IMDB. There is too much paid reviews going on. Trust has been lost.",1
9 May 2022,Was Not Expecting This At All,"I don't ever write reviews but this one needed one. 10/10 perfect like omg, compared to the trash that has been releasing lately this movie is a movie of the decade.

12 May 2022,Utter masterpiece of cinema,"This film was the best film I've seen all year I was so desperate to watch it, as the UK got a delayed release date, luckily with my Odeon limitless membership I got to experience this work of art a couple of days early. Visually this film is stunning, most of the shots are just so amazing to look at and must have taken quite some ingenuity to put together. The different universes are so well handled and all feel vastly different from one another but are also grounded in a somewhat similar reality. There are plenty of moments where I heard the whole crowd laughing as there wasn't a single line that didn't land well. The performances by Yeoh and Quan are very well executed giving life to incredibly fleshed out and relatable characters who you really empathise with and want to see overcome their barriers and obstacles they encounter. The overall philosophical message I took form the film was of Nihilism and how sometimes there is no meaning to what events happen, but not to get too bogged down so that you don't see what's truly important right in front of you. This was very liberating and refreshing to see. I've never heard of the director duo before but I know they're now on my radar and I am extremely excited to see what other works they will be creating and will surely dive deeper into their previous cinematic works. It comes to no surprise why this film was produced by A24 who have produced other amazing films such as Moonlight and The Lighthouse. This film is a must watch, you won't regret it.",10
10 May 2022,Very good but could have been a masterpiece,"3rd watch and back to my initial opinion. A masterpiece from a technical point of view, with great performances (Hsu is perfect, but Yeoh and Quan do a great job too) and I love almost all the slow moments (a bit too much exposition in the third act though).

I still think this would be even better with less 20-25 minutes and that the 2nd act is too much, it's overwhelming and I always disconnect for some minutes, feeling the urge to pause it.

The themes are relevant and the way they are treated in the script is great. A bit less of that ""ecstasy feeling"" or stupidity for the sake of it and could have been one of the greatest. Either way, a must-see and a film that can leave a mark on an entire generation. Or at least, on Film Twitter.

8 January 2023,An Unforgettable Amalgamation of Genres,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film that is narratively wondrous. The film is centered around a Chinese-American family and their financial, and relational troubles. The story transforms into a science fiction quest around the multiverse to find purpose. Michelle Yeoh leads the cast as Evelyn Quan Wang, the Wang family's bitter matriarch. She is accompanied by a supporting cast that includes Stephanie Hsu as her daughter Joy, Ke Huy Quan as Evelyn's husband, Waymond, James Hong as Gong Gong, and Jamie Lee Curtis as the family's auditor, Deirdre. This is the second feature film for co-directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (the duo known as ""Daniels""). Everything, Everywhere All at Once is a romantic telling of the meaning of life and love through a vivid and ingenious imagination.

From top to bottom, the cast steals the show with their performance. The actors show a depth and range that is uncanny for a singular film. The cast plays multiple versions of their primary character from different universes. Each version provides a different emotional compass and a unique sense of being. For example, the film's primary Evelyn is dissimilar from another universe's Evelyn. Michelle Yeoh successfully captures each version of Evelyn through novel usage of body language and line delivery. Ke Huy Quan's portrayal of Waymond and his alternative selves matches the acting prowess of Yeoh. However, Quan's acting is much more emotional and sentimental. Each Waymond feels poignant. Primary Waymond is a touching character that serves as the family's glue. Stephanie Hsu's portrayal of Joy is characteried through melancholy, rage, and arrogance. Primary Joy is melancholic, whereas the alternate version of Joy, Jobu Topaki is filled with rage and self-assurance. Hsu's execution of Joy and Topaki is well-done. She is a bright spot in the film, serving as the quintessential heartbreaker. Jamie Lee Curtis and James Hong bolster the movie's depth. They each compliment the cast's performances. Their acting matches the tone needed for key scenes and moments. Largely, the cast triumphs in chemistry and

Aesthetically, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a marvel. Akin to the actor's performances, the movie offers are plethora of stages and scenery. Each universe is visually distinct. Various aspect ratios are used throughout the film to distinguish universes. Filters were also used to differentiate each universe. The movie's cinematography appropriately fluctuates from being lush to harrowing. Action sequences in the film were well-crafted. The fight scenes were captivating. Unusual objects were used throughout the Kung-Fu segments, offering a sense of levity and brutality. The movie is a visual spectacle that manifests itself as a potrait of clashing art forms.

The Daniels created a multiverse that triumphs in the exploration of themes such as family. They used the complex concept of the multiverse to provide a simple answer to life's mysteries. Plain constructs such as family are used as a bridge to the disjointed structure of the multiverse. As directors, they flourish in capturing many genres into one picture. The use of comedy balances drama. Scenes and sections of the film are written as if they were an escape from each other. One scene is counteracted by another scene, yet the drama and weight of the story is maintained. What may appear to be difficult to follow, culminates in a narrative that is multifaceted in essence. Furthermore, the film is authenticated through its' use of Chinese culture and languages. Simply put, the writing is tangible and awe-inspiring all the same.

Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the most innovative and original depictions of family and the conflicts that come with relationships. The film traverses the unknown by using the known as a navagation tool. It is an unforgettable, yet picturesque amalgamation.",10
26 March 2023,Cite,"My initial score of this movie was an 8.

So someone really enjoyed Sense8 it would appear. This movie was well made and visually appealing, performances are good - I'm not personally seeing Oscars here. It was cute and fun, but it's a get high and watch it once kind of thing for me. Equal parts trying too hard and really well executed meta. Then a stupid slapstick butt plug element. Perhaps I am not seeing something everyone else is - yet i still think it's a 7. It's a fun movie.

But in my opinion its the Matrix + Sense8 (so, Wachowskis influenced) with some sort of half heartedly executed family drama/comedy underneath and a dash of Scott pilgrim meets Kill Bill? (That may be a stretch)

My rating is dropping as it goes on and somehow is making me sad. Someone's playing a piano with their feet now, for reference.

This movie should perhaps be the beginning of the end of the multiverse concept - which itself is really played out. (Movies still going .. at least 20 minutes since I started writing)

They haven't wrapped the battle or the family subplot. So, I'm gonna be here awhile... (11 min later) I think we're nearing the end now.

Hmm. What was this? Was it good? Ya. Was I entertained? Yes. Did I like it? No.",6
29 May 2022,Maybe the best movie I've ever seen,"I went into this wondering if I would understand anything, based on everything I had seen about it up until the lights went down and the film started, and I am so glad I saw this in a theater, don't know if I would have appreciated it otherwise. This movie blew me away, I did not have a hard time following at all. It was a beautiful masterpiece, that really has everything! I laughed so hard, I loved the action, the visuals, the emotion, everything about this movie was AMAZING. It better win all the awards!!

5 March 2023,Funny movie. Nothing else. Best Movie Oscar? Never!,"I finally watched this movie. And I've watched it heavily influenced by the awards and the buzz around it. So when I started, my expectations were huge, although I had no idea what I was going to watch.

The synopsis read: ""a Chinese immigrant gets involved in a crazy adventure where she can only save the world by exploring other universes"". Well, I was already expecting something that would draw on physics and embark on the science fiction genre.

And that's it, and it's a lot more, but it's all a little confusing and kind of chaotic. It's too close to those American Jack Chan movies. Of course, there will be those who love it, but I've been a movie buff for over 50 years and I'm not carried away by the excitement of the masses. I have a critical sense.

Therefore, I watched the 1st 1 hour and 40 minutes of film, but without ever marveling. The most I felt was a lot of curiosity.

In the end I gave it a 7 because of Michele Yeoh's magnificent performance and the last 40 minutes, which are truly redeeming from a human and emotional point of view, but that would never justify favoritism for the Oscar for Best Picture, as I've seen. But Michele might win Best Actress.",7
27 April 2022,Everything Everywhere All at Once Review,"Easily the best film of this decade so far. The 2020s have produced some phenomenal films but this wipes the table with them. Genuinely one of the most creative and heartwarming films to come out in a while. This film takes the multiverse concept that's been trending for the past year or two and takes it a whole new original direction. The incorporation of it works and I loved it. The Daniels did a fantastic job directing this. There is a funny and unique style present throughout the whole film that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Michelle Yeoh, Key Huy Quan, and Stephanie Hsu are fantastic here and all 3 of their performances are somewhere on my 3 favorite performances of this year. Their characters are incredibly unique and interesting to follow and it's a great return to screen for Quan who hasn't been in a major film since The Goonies. They did a fantastic job playing all these different versions of themselves and making them feel familiar yet different at the same time. The emotional beats work so well. The film made me tear up on multiple occasions in the last 30 minutes because these characters are just so wonderful to follow. Any scene at the end manages to make you happy for these characters and the struggle that they have been through. The action and cinematography go hand in hand with amazing they are. There isn't an action set piece that feels repeated and every scene is so amazing in their own separate way whether it's really cool and badass or just really funny as well. This film manages to use so many different cool and fun colors that immediately keep your eyes glued to the screen no matter what is going on. The film's use of themes like existentialism and where we belong in this world work perfectly for this story and even we are no one, we are someone out there to somebody else. This is an absolutely necessary watch for anyone who enjoys movies. It's a masterpiece in every aspect of filmmaking and it 100% deserves the price of admission. Go see this right now.",10
16 April 2022,Into the multi-verse with Michelle Yeoh,"If nothing else, Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively Daniels) certainly must be credited with a truth in titling nod for their movie - It certainly (and repeatedly) lives up to its moniker.

Scraping away all of the noise, EVERYTHING actually has a very basic premise which could have resulted in some poignancy. A Chinese-American couple, Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) and Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), are having marital issues which extend to communicating with their daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). Adding to the discord are a crusty IRS Agent (an almost unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis) who has the family business under audit, and Evelyn's father Gong (James Hong; a fine presence here) -- who she also has parental issues with.

Unfortunately, Daniels have piled on a Multi-verse plot which combines elements of THE MATRIX, SLIDING DOORS and the recent SPIDERMAN: FAR FROM HOME. Instead of having three Spidermen, we seemingly have dozens of iterations of Evelyn. What the Daniels don't bring are a clear clean narrative, genuine insight or a semblance of drama (something the other three pictures all had). Certainly, Daniels get points for a few amusing bits and pieces along the way, but no matter how many hot dogs, bagels, pet rocks and raccoons that are fetishized here, the characters get lost in the sound and fury. Also noteworthy is that any faintly clever notion will be repeated and repeated -- so it's safe to take refreshment breaks. It's like an old Warner Brothers cartoon, except that Chuck Jones and Tex Avery could express their craziness in a tidy 7 minutes, not the elephantine 132 here (a couple of times, audience members got up thinking it was over; and, at the end there was audible sighs of relief that it actually was).

The cast is game (dozens of Michelle Yeohs isn't a bad thing) and the effects are quite good for a fairly modestly budgeted effects extravaganza. As noted at the outset, there is an actual family story to be told here (and, eventually, does), but for all of Daniels' fancy tricks, the ending could much more cogently been arrived at with little if any of the sound and fury. After all the convoluted metaphysical happenings the big takeaway is the simplest of homilies. Indeed, one could eliminate almost the entirety of the almost two hour SFX sideshow and arrive at the very same life lesson with only a couple of 'verses' - or, even just one.",
11 August 2022,Very overrated in my opinion. It's OK.,"Although this film is visually pretty amazing, it really needed to SLOW DOWN. By the end I had a better idea of what was going on, but the first half of the movie was so fast and whacky... and in 2 languages. The rules of the story world were explained so quickly that it didn't give us any time to process them. The film had what seemed like 4 climaxes, one with the dad, one with the husband, one with the IRS lady and then one with the daughter. It's an extremely complicated movie, and I'm sorry, just because it's complicated doesn't make it ""brilliant"". It was EXHAUSTING. I found myself nodding off constantly throughout this film. Kung Fu alone isn't enough to keep me awake. It's like the daughter said towards the end: it's all just a bunch of random stuff flying around that doesn't mean anything. That's the same reason I couldn't get emotionally invested in the film. It was too chaotic to get me invested. So by the time we finally started to try to go somewhere towards the end, it just felt very melodramatic. It's a Wonderful Life knew how do build up to what this movie eventually builds up to, but it prepares us for it flawlessly. This film had a very hard time finding its way getting to that point where it could reveal a much similar theme. It was long and exhausting. Writing non linear stories is extremely tough... and visually, the film is a technical achievement. I just wish it wasn't so convoluted. I see what they're trying to do... in the end I got it, but was it worth it? I'm not so sure.",6
12 March 2023,Worst Film Ever Made,"I am wide open to film genres. I love everything from Disney to David Lynch, Kubrick, etc. I have only walked out of two films in my life ""Spy Kids 3"" and this horrible mess. I stayed longer than I should have, hoping something redeeming would happen but it never did. I haven't even looked up the crew but the writer should be banned from every writing again. And whoever financed this garbage should have a mental stability evaluation. I am completely baffled by the 8/10 rating and Oscar nominations. The Oscars and imdb have zero credibility. After they allowed the host to be assaulted last year, I thought they would make an effort to be more credible but this is obviously some kind of sympathy or white guild nominations.

18 May 2022,"""You're capable of anything because you're so bad at everything.""","There are so many things that can be talked about when it comes to this movie. As we are always in the pop culture one thing that a lot of people knew before even going in is how an A24 made a multiverse movie that has a bigger scope than the MCU multiverse movie which is the one thing people expected them to deliver.

Then there's the way it mixes a lot of genres so successfully which honestly made me feel like I'm watching an Indian commercial ""masala"" movie. The music in the emotional scenes in the last 20 minutes was exactly that kind of music too.

Then there are the many references they made so great. From Raccaccoonie to the evolution of apes while western classical music is playing. Michelle Yeoh herself as a successful action star looking back.

Then in the movie itself so many moments that make you laugh, cheer and cry. The way they explored relationships and life. How the world breaks you down and how nihilism takes you on. The simple reasons that are so powerful to break the multiverse. I cried so much in the last 20 minutes.",10
15 April 2022,One glorious rollercoaster ride from start to finish,"This movie has everything I typically enjoy in a movie. Comedy that works, action sequences that are smooth and imaginative, and a well connected cast of characters.

I want to say the conclusion is a little wishy-washy but shouldn't really take too much away from the rest of the movie. I always appreciate stories that gets you to think about the relationships you currently have and reflect on your own life. Absolutely recommended for anyone open to a fantastical journey into the unknown!

26 March 2022,A beautifully wild piece of art.,"I would like to paint a picture for those who read this, imagine that all you have to go in for this movie is the title and the photo of Michelle Yeoh protecting her family behind her. What movie do you think that is?

Answer is you most definitely guessed wrong, there is no way to.accurately know where this movie is going. It travels at the speed of light, fully embracing the weird zany imagination of it's two directors.

I was truly surprised at every turn and brought to an emotional crescendo by the climax. I want to scream about this movie to the heavens, but I think the absolute best way to see it is completely blind. I will definitely see it again when it goes to theaters and take as many people as I can with me.

15 May 2022,I got bored one day and put everything on a bagel,"There is literally a little bit of everything and everywhere pretty much all at once! It's a pure assault on the senses which not only shows the amount of skill these two directors have at keeping things somewhat under control, but also underlines just how creative they truly are too! There's a LOT of ideas floating around here but if you can mentally keep up, this is a hugely rewarding film that deserves every bit of praise it's been receiving.

FYI: I wrote this review with my toes... Literally impossible to type with my giant hot dog fingers.

10 March 2023,Not sure what the fuss is about,"Ok - it's different, ok - it's quirky... But so what? There are plenty of off-the-wall odd films out there, Everything Everywhere has nothing more or less than any of the others. I can think of ""V for Vendetta"" for example, which is a much better film.

Why the fuss then, why all these Oscars? Short answer - no idea. Everything really isn't that good. It's sci-fi, but it doesn't work as sci-fi. Actually it's about family and expectations, but again - so what?

It's fast, frenetic and a little hard to follow: only engaging to a point. This movie is limited by the fact that when it's all over and the titles roll you sit there and think - well ok, how has this added to my knowledge of the human condition - or - indeed my knowledge of movies and storytelling through a camera? The answer is: not at all.

I'm gonna give it 7 because I was entertained, and the film did have some funny moments.",7
20 February 2023,Possibly the Most Creative Film made Lately,"A woman tries to do her taxes, and finds out that life is far more quirky, weird, and fulfilling than she ever imagined.

This is a strange movie. The concept has been done to death lately (multiverse), but this film takes that concept to the next level and blows away most attempts of others to make a compelling and meaningful multiverse movie. (The first Spiderverse film is still my favourite in this category). Nevertheless, this movie is ambitious, has lots of heart, and really explores what it means to have a fulfilling life.

I think lots of people would enjoy this movie, but it isn't for everyone. It is strange, but the acting is superb, the visuals are ambitious, but often stunning. I don't know if it's quite 'best picture' material - but it is probably the most creative film produced lately.

13 August 2022,Creative coherent take on nihilism vs optimism,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",7
1 April 2022,"Not as original in plot and premise, but sheer creativity and ideas keep it engaging and entertaining","Best described as Sam Raimi, Hideaki Anno & Satoshi Kon by way of the Shaw Bros, with bits of Inception, The Matrix, Slaughterhouse Five and the cult Don Coscarelli film John Dies at the End. That latter pic had similar style and ideas but a more original plot. If not for the standard ""chosen one"" premise that has long since been exploded by The Lego Movie a decade ago, EEAAO could have been a masterpiece.

And it does come close - VERY close. Seriously, never before have butt plugs been so crucial to saving the universe.

However my biggest gripe is that it reaches its climax at about the 1 hour 40 min mark - then just keeps going. I started zoning out and wanting the movie to just get to the point of it all. I'm all for creativity and invention, but the final act of this could have been tightened up way the hell more in editing.

Strongly recommended, though. Go have a blast!",8

25 February 2023,Too fragmented for us,"I know I'm bucking the trend here, but my wife and I just couldn't get into this film and abandoned it after forty minutes. We simply didn't like or identify with ANY of the characters, and thought both Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis were utterly wasted.

After forty minutes, I think we SHOULD have had a better idea what the story was about and a handle on the roles involved. But the constant shifting left us shaking our heads with no real grounding but the basic idea of the story, which I think took FAR too long to get around to. Much of the early part of the film in the laundry added nothing and should have been cut.

Scenes I'm sure were meant to be amusing didn't tickle our funny bone. I'm happy for everyone who enjoyed this film, but it's not for everyone, and we're in that crowd.

9 April 2022,Sci-Fi with HEART!!,"It is not about the science. It is about emotions. The film is not all about martial arts. The family dynamic is strong in Michelle Yeoh. She is the main reason to watch this film.

This film examines the multiverse from the perspective that a person pulls in memories from a multiverse counterpart as opposed to traveling to the multiverse themself. You get to watch the protagonist evolve (hero's arc/journey) as she learns/earns the abilities she needs to achieve her goal by the end of the film. By the final act you feel for 'Evelyn' as she has her showdown with the antagonist. It pulls at your heartstrings and came close to earning 9 stars.

27 August 2023,Breaking Hollywood,"This is by far the most creative film ever made. Stanidng alone this film merits 9 stars for its mere creative acheivement, masterful storytelling and honestly one of the most complex relevant hard hitting messages ive ever seen in film.

Now that being said... THIS FILM WAS EDITED BY 9 PEOPLE, NONE OF WHICH STUDIED VFX. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! THIS FILM ABSOLUTELY REEKS OF ACHEIVEMENT.

A group of self taught friends get together and make a movie, and it kicks butt. This film goes to show you don't need much to make an awesome film. You just need vision and passion! This film has it. It stinks of it from the moment it begins. There is so much feeling in this film.

This film deserves 10 stars because of what this group of people acheived. Outstanding. Inspirational. This film shall break Hollywood!",10
19 May 2022,Thank You,"This is how you make a film. I'm sure I have the same take as thousands of other folks so I won't even bother. If you have a heart and a brain, this movie is for you. It really excels in its transitions from verse to verse. I was never confused or had to do 4D chess to figure out the story, and it's not a simple story. Writing, cinematography, choreography, editing, acting and directing work harmoniously to curate a beautiful, moving film about the IRS and a bagel.

22 February 2023,Philosophical masterpiece,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

30 May 2023,A Bit Lacking In the Execution,"The concept of this movie is excellent. Multiverses are trendy at the moment and this is the most thought-provoking and well-realized cinematic exploration of a multiverse in recent memory. Performances are generally good. Michelle Yeoh and James Hong are unsurprisingly solid but the standout is Ke Huy Quan as Yeoh's ostensibly weak and well-intentioned husband. The movie starts strong with an engaging blend of drama, intrigue, action and absurd comedy. Unfortunately it can't sustain its early momentum: as the central mystery unravels the movie becomes increasingly slow-paced, smarmy and repetitive. The heartfelt finale is obvious from about the midway point and the movie takes way too long to get there. Flabby editing in the second half undercuts most of the charm and novelty of the premise.

24 April 2022,A truly special film,"This is the type of film that only comes out every couple years or so. Imagine Charlie Kaufman meets The Matrix. It's ambitious in scope and complex, yet somehow easy enough to understand on first viewing and unpretentious (unlike a lot of Christopher Nolan's work, which is complex for the sake of it, without much payoff). All this while being fun, funny, and emotionally captivating. There are even callbacks to humorous moments, both comedic and dramatic, that still manage to heighten the stakes. The scope of the story is ultimately small; at the end of the day it's about a family dealing with financial difficulties, a possible divorce, and a distant daughter. How the rest of the events unfold is up to the viewer's interpretation, but I like how it works on multiple levels like that. I really don't want to say much else, just go see it. There's something for everyone and it's hard for me to think of another recent movie that works so well on essentially every level. It may sound clich√©d, but I laughed, I cried, it got me thinking, this is what cinema was made for. That's saying something coming from me. I bounced back and forth between a 9 and 10, but with the last couple years being pretty meh for movies, we need something like this right now.",10
21 May 2022,"Something different with spectacular CGI, but could have been shorter.","A ""something different"" film with its plot, premise and style which manages to be very funny, silly and emotionally heart wrenching, but always entertaining. The CGI was spectacular and full on, a real showcase of visual effects full of vibrant colours and perfect timing. The plot, acting and fight scenes were good, but there weren't that many fights and the film was too long with drawn out plot explanation sections. The music and fashion was weird, but suited the presentation and meant you never knew what you were going to see next.

16 March 2023,Horrible Film,"I really do not know how this film got Oscars and praise for this rubbish. It's so bad I had to walk out, I had wanted to see it for a long time because I love all things other worldly; but as for this film it made no sense at all. The only thing I can think is that the Oscars community are thinking its time for the Asian community to get some loving. Honestly if they are going to do this, do it with a film worthy of praise - not this type of Rubbish.

I blew someone off to see this film and it just wasn't worth it. All my dreams disappeared in the first 30 minutes, but then I thought be fair and after 60 minutes it was going on, and on and so I left.

21 January 2023,The heart has its reason that reason knows nothing of,"If you open your mind and your heart, u can see the film's meaning. It's a message of love in a land of war, a scream of unity (as family, friends, humans..) in a society of individuals, an hymn to the failure in a world of forced success. It's human and should be more intimistic or more adventurous, but it's what we are & what we should be. The better version of us is inside & not outside: changing is possible everytime, everywhere & all at once!

Sorry for my English but I only want to add my little voice at the others that describes with better words this incredible, beautiful, lovely & gorgeous film where all is one & one is all!

22 May 2022,This film hits differently from a mental health view.,"Ok backstory, I'm 35, have had a few bad traumas in life and have severe depression, I gets spells where life is ok but rarely get motivated or passionate and it's really tough, on the day of going to this I was having a particularly bad episode and nearly skipped it but I'm glad I didn't.

I rang someone on the way home, I felt visibly happier, more optimistic, my brain thinking differently and trust me when I say, thousands of pounds and therapies haven't hit me this way this much. I don't know if everyone got the same message as me but the beauty of film is in various interpretations. It's such a difficult film to describe, if you go into detail (ie the award, if you know you know) people will scoff and think how can this be as good as it is.

My brain is chaotic as a lot of depressed peoples are so maybe why I connected with this film, there's no agendas, no woke message, just about gratitude for what you have, how time is genuinely precious and that the grass isn't always greener, you can wish time away, coast through life but you will miss a lot and potentially on a lot of happiness, I've heard these messages millions of times but it hit me in this film, like I say, chaos seemed to just fit my head.

There's beauty, humour, emotion, art, complex emotions, homages to so much pop culture, there's stuff for everyone if you give it a go, it may require you to let go, because if seen thousands of films and this is one of a kind. There might be issues with the film from a critique standpoint but to get the positivity and enjoyment I got out of it I can't recommend it enough .",10
14 March 2023,Overrated. Just a funny and confusing movie,"Not so much to say... An Sunday movie, with 4 o 5 funny scenes that repeat them selves over and over ... Ok acting and editing....but, for an Oscar reward.... No, man, noooo!

They took ideas from Ratatouille (more evident) and the matrix (not so evident) ir order to stuff more than 2 hours of unnecessary time.... Maybe a 1.5hrs movie tops.... This is an evidence of how low cinema has fall this time .. I hope more profound movies in near future to be at least considered for an Academy Award...

It is nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis in a funny role... But not so much to say about this... Please Hollywood make better movies.

Plenty of 'right in the feels' as well. A brilliant intertwining of cosmic/metaphysical/moral/existential nihilism, absurdism, Buddhism, and existentialism (and probably some other philosophies I missed the first time) with a simple a clear demonstration (eventually) of love, meaning, and courage.

Let go...,

17 July 2023,The cast saves the movie.,"The one redeeming thing about EEAAO is the acting. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Ke Huy Quan hold your attention throughout the entirety of this film. They're capable of distilling the craziness of the movie's plot into something plateable.

The story itself isn't bad, just the execution. The Daniel's style isn't for me. They're technically proficient but they make creative choices that are strange and stupid. EEAAO falls of the rails at multiple times throughout the runtime because the story is just too confusing.

I wouldn't watch this again. To me, it's very overrated and the gimmick of the multiverse gets old very fast when it's as convoluted as it is here.

23 January 2023,Nothing burger with everything on it.,"Matrix plus hitchhikers guide in a frenetic modern asian-cinema style.

There's an audience for this. But it's not me.

My wife liked the mother daughter aspect. My 14 year old daughter was ambivalent.

I found it derivative of so many other, better, sources. Matrix obviously. The infinite improbability of hitchhikers guide. Scott pilgrim. Etc etc etc.

The comedy was low brow and unfunny. My young boys thought the dildo fight was funny. No one else did.

The acting by ""short round/data"" was really amateurish. He has a sweet presence but he's only only marginally talented. It's absurd that he received accolades for this.

Honestly, we all thought he was much younger than michelle yeoh. It took everyone a minute to realize they were married. He looks 38, she looks 58.

For all its chaos it could be dull, for all its attempts at family drama it was not compelling. For all its slapstick it was not very funny. (unless you loved the ghostbusters reboot).

This felt like a film made by millennials for millennials... hyperkinetic, ambitious, but with no real grounding. No cohesiveness in vision.",6
5 February 2023,Feeling Befuddled After Viewing,"I understand the main point of the movie. It could have been told in a way that was more pleasant to view and that took a lot less time. Instead it is scene after scene, and way too many of them... AND contains some of the most stupid, long, drawn-out and boring, nonsensical scenes. Without being cruel in any way I can honestly say it gives one the feeling the movie was filmed and edited by someone who has a very, very short attention span.

I was curious about it when I read the description but not enough to want to view it. I happened to be watching my favourite talk show host, Graham Norton, the evening that Jamie Lee Curtis was a guest. After hearing Jamie and Graham both rave about how the movie is so good, surprisingly unexpected and incredible it then grabbed my interest. Jamie actually moaning 'oh it's so good'... 'oh it's so good'... 'oh it's so incredibly good'. Jamie went on to describe the movie to be multi-verse but at the center of it she said there is love, kindness, family and unity. I didn't pick up on the feelings if they existed. Another part that I didn't see was Jamie's description of a certain scene as being one of the most moving parts of the movie. I watched the scene but anything moving just moved right over me. And there is talk of Oscars for this thing?... The only Oscar that should be handed out, and deserved, is for Jamie's near orgasmic representation she gave on Graham's show, 'oh it's so good'... 'oh it's so good'... 'oh it's so incredibly good'. That turned out to be the best bit of acting I have seen in a long time. I believed it. But it is NOT so good...it is not even a little bit good.",1
7 May 2022,"If ""Sorry to Bother You"" was actually smart.","I had seen STBY in an advance screening and was immensely disappointing. Having a ""twist"" came at the cost of its characters and plot being half-baked. Not so here. This film is hilarious and visceral from beginning to end. Its absurdism and sci-fi elements enhance the story rather than serve as a twist. The cast is stellar throughout and clearly had a blast making the film. This is a prime example of making a script that is truly designed for a visual medium - you could not tell this story outside film, and that's a good thing. Clever and fun action paired with sincere dialogue and stunning visuals, EEAaO is a tour de force of high concept filmmaking done without sacrificing humor or entertainment for the sake of being ""art.""

14 March 2023,Beautiful,"Its a beautiful gem we have here. I will admit it is a little bit over the top at points. Just stay on because it will clearer.

This i a smart script with full of undertones and subtle messages to life, whats worth living for and how to treat your loved ones. Its about appreaciating what you got.

The film is about Evelyn who feels overwelmed with life and Having some kind of nervous breakdown and travels to other dimensions re-descovering her life.

The acting is superb, I honestly think Both Stephanie Hsu and Jamie Lee Curtis could have picked up The Oscar.

Only downfall for me is that it feels quite long.

It was also very long and sometimes boring. I like when are movie is so good that even though I don't like its genre I love the final product which here was not the case. Unfortunately my expectations were very high and they're not fulfilled.

Why not leaving it at 3 parallel universes? Instead they showed us some universes that absolutely didnt matter to the plot. And this whole bagel-thing? Is that supposed to be funny? And this hot dog-finger-thing? Where is the need to show this more than once? And...OMG....just finish it. Why is this movie so painfully long?

The story seemed interesting but my brain just couldn't handle the style/pace in which this movie was shot. I was anxious the entire time and was not able to sit trough it.

I think that movies like this should have a warning, the same way some video games have.

I don't know what else to say. Still have about 174 character left. But I wanted to write is as I think it's important.

Anyway, there are some good moments in this movie, but overall ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is just Too Much IMO.

25 January 2023,"I liked it a lot, but even if you didn't, you must admit it's remarkably creative and ambitious","There's no question that EEAAO is one of the most well-regarded movies of the year, and it's leading the charge in Oscar nominations with a total of 11. It's is to be expected, since it's very much not a blockbuster and more the type of film the Academy would tend to award. At the same time, it is a bit of a surprise given that it's a very out-there kind of movie, with an almost outrageous concept and even more outlandish execution.

That being said, it's almost a miracle that this movie works at all, given that it is very true to its title, it's a lot of things at the same time. Incidentally, that's what takes a lot of people out of the movie.

In a very summarized way, EEAAO tells the story of Evelyn, an immigrant middle-aged woman from China living in the US, where she manages a failing laundromat with her husband Waymond and daughter Joy. Her marriage to Waymond is failing, her daughter Joy feels like her mom does not truly understand her for who she is and resents her for it and the laundromat is at risk of closure due to an imminent IRS audit.

At this critical moment in her life, Evelyn finds herself day-dreaming about what her life could have been like, and incidentally, people from other dimensions pop into her life and ask her help in stopping an interdimensional threat that is on the verge of destroying the entire multiverse and dooming it all to non-existence. In combating this threat, Evelyn understands the true value to be found in her simple life and re-contextualizes her outlook on the world and on her relationships.

On paper, this seems wacky enough, but what's interesting is that the character work on Evelyn and the overall themes of the movie are pretty grounded and not wacky at all. If the multiverse aspects of the plot were removed you would have a typical premise for a drama about a struggling family of Chinese immigrants struggling to integrate socially and financially in the ruthless capitalist system of the United States. And that would be pretty Oscar-bait in itself with plenty of social commentary going on, which is fine. But EEAAO, having those dramatic components, uses the premise of looking at alternative versions of your life as a twist on that premise to heighten the themes in a pretty creative way.

Mind you, the multiverse stuff is not just a gimmick used to make the plot seem or artsy, indie, or wacky for the sake of it. While I understand it may seem that way, what it actually does, besides breaking genre tropes, is expand the themes of the character story underneath and turn it into a more existential exploration of what we value in life, no matter how small or meaningless, of the need to reject nihilism, and of how a different perspective can change our whole outlook of ourselves and others. The movie just wouldn't allow for that if that part of the movie was excluded.

That said, this is a big reach for a movie with a small budget and contained settings, so you really have to let your imagination run wild to embrace the concept as it develops and that might be a stretch for some. The editing is fast, cuts are even faster, the movie rarely slows down to fit it all in. It works amazingly well for me and is a testament to economic film making and sharp editing, but for others it came off as disorienting.

It goes without saying that the acting is pretty damn good from everyone in this small cast, they completely buy into it and run with every crazy concept, which makes them land as they should. Additionally, there are scenes that are so incredibly hilarious in concept alone that it made wish I had such ideas.

In the end, if this movie isn't for you, I understand. It is kind of absurd, very silly at several points, incredibly fast-paced and definitely unfamiliar to most audiences. But even if that is the case, before you judge it a 1/10, consider the scene with Waymond talking about how he fights, or with Evelyn reconnecting with Joy in the parking lot at the end of the movie. Because those, to an extent, embody the true point, the message of the movie, and solidify the fact that there is something being said here besides people with sausages for fingers, googly eyes and Ratatouille references (all of which are great jokes for me).

Consider also, that even if you like movies that are more grounded in essence, plot and character, we have a lot of movies like Elvis (as an example only, I know Elvis is good), or Top Gun: Maverick (again, great movie, but it's a sequel, it's more Top Gun), or The Fabelmans (it's another Steven Spielberg movie, directed in the same way, with little innovation). There are not a lot of movies like EEAAO, it shares similarities with other multiverse stories in concept alone, but it uses that concept to explore entirely different things, in a different way, with a shoestring budget and somehow doesn't fall apart.

That's impressive to me, it is to be commended, and it's how the art of making movies evolves and avoids stagnation. Just my opinion.",9
4 February 2023,attention deficit disorder special,"Michelle Yeoh does an admirable job of displaying dozens of different emotions in the multiple personas of the same character in this movie. Unfortunately, most are shown in disjointed snippets as the film speeds through high speed transitions.

I actually had trouble staying awake while watching this film because of the sensory overload of too many images changing rapidly.

Frankly, I think that employing a multi-universe is lazy storytelling. Need a special skill escape to danger? Just tap into a version of yourself in an alternative universe and utilize in your current situation.

The hot dog finger universe was funny for a few seconds but required a massive suspension of disbelief. Who, exactly, built that piano with their non-functional hotdog fingers?

The movie slows down and becomes emotional and poignant at the end. It was a satisfying conclusion.",6
19 May 2022,What a Mess,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

8 March 2023,This movie is definitely chaotic and that is the point of overthinking what could have been,Watched this on a streaming service when our family just recently subscribed into one on a smart tv. I've heard how great this movie is but I should have prepared more for the chaos that was about to ensue. I would really have much preferred watching this at home as I don't think I can handle that much visually in theaters. But I think the editing and production was great enough to show the parallels of the timelines and the actions. I didn't like some of the embarrassing scenes but I think that's just me with any kind of scenes like that on other films. I did enjoy the rest of the movie even if most of the humor wasn't really my thing but I get the point of those. Just going with the flow and not thinking too much about everything or else it will be easy to get stuck questioning a lot of things. I do like the originality and the creative execution of a fairly simple story of acceptance of what ever already happened and dealing with problems in an optimistic way. It was a fun experience and it's probably not one that I would watch over and over again as it was already fulfilling the first time.,8
10 May 2022,May be one of my favorite movies of all time,"I actually knew nothing about this film going in. I literally had no expectations except I heard it's excellent. And yet it still surpassed my expectations. This film lives up to its title, in execution and reaction.

I cackled in laughter at the absurdity of the humor, I cried, I was entranced, etc. I tend to have a short attention span and long movies are hard for me (I fell asleep during The Batman) but this kept my eyes glued to the screen from start to finish.

It feels like a movie that takes inspiration from so many others but mashed them together as an amalgamation of all their best elements while being it's own thing.

24 February 2023,Emotional rollercoaster! The worst movie ever yet the best one!,"In this order -> At the beginning you get confused about all the hypes and get disappointed. You don't halt watching it because you wanna understand what the movie is about. You reach halfway with that confused state. Then you start to understand the concept -> then you start to enjoy it somehow -> then you get the point of the movie and you start to think about yourself -> then you start to think about this cruel world -> at the last part of the movie you completely understand the message of the movie and you become emotional with what you see in it. You may cry but at the end you may see and feel the better version of you running on your body. The movie ends then you join the group who hyped the movie.

19 March 2023,"Great visuals, poor content, bad storytelling","Except for the visual effects, there's nothing interesting about this movies. Solving everything by being kind, I wish life was that simple but it's not and it never has been. Also the first part of the movie was about really good, the confusion, and that fact that no one seemed to have the right answer. And then everything became about love and acceptance. I think our generation need to acknowledge that tough parenting is not necessarily bad, it's what makes you a good and strong person who's able to deal with things like mental illness and the cruelty of the world. Nothing matters?? No, everything we do matters, everything we do affect other people and affect future generations.

23 April 2022,A timely masterpiece with a lesson for everyone,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a spellbinding action packed heartfelt well written masterpiece. Everyone in this movie is absolutely terrific and while it is confusing and surprisingly hilarious at times,it is also possibly the best movie I've ever seen in my 26 years of life. I cannot say enough about the movie or the actors, everyone here deserves some award and what is most profound is how this movie appeals to quite literally everyone in some way. I am blown away by everything in this movie and will absolutely be buying it as soon as it's available.

2 September 2022,Yep! Worth seeing.,"It is understandable that some people refer to an apparent immaturity in the construction of this film with regard to the dimensions of action or fiction. In fact, it is sometimes a little disconcerting the lack of impact of some script pages or scenes that, if placed in the hands of a better salesman, could become much more memorable for the viewer.

Even so, this fact does not have the negative impact that one might expect for the film as a whole.

This is not a film that seems to take itself too seriously compared to its action and fiction competitors, because perhaps its proposal is for a more interesting story, told in a deeper way than they manage to propose.

If you are looking for a film with a big heart, with an invitation to reflection that each of us can embark on in our own way, with a generous dose of absurdity, some good mood and very good interpretations, this is a film that will be worth your while.",7
27 June 2022,"Great first 2 acts, the 3rd act was too long.","Everything was going well, imaginative and creative and crazy (in a good way). Great action scenes, and had me laughing out loud in the theater throughout. My issue was the end, I guess it was exhausting and it could have been trimmed here and there but that's just me. In the theater i saw how the audience were like ""it's still going?"". I gave it an 8 just cuz the end could have been shorter.

3 March 2023,Ambitious,"Am I the only one who feels like 70% of the movie was written by AI?

(I also think I saw ""Toblerone"" chocolate in one of the fast scenes).

I don't really want to have an opinion on this mega ambitious movie. I understand the rating, it has many awesome elements, dealt with many different topics, acting is awesome, and it showed eternal mother-daughter problem in a very deep and new way. But for me personally it didn't work, maybe because of its fast-paced bilingual start that I didn't get too involved. It feels a bit like a forced ""Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" type of thing with all the modern internet topics about your purpose, full potential, multiverses and all. Always makes me wonder did author really felt these things on his own skin or it's just an exploitation of major themes of the mases. But definitely something in sync with all this current AI revolution, somehow.

21 June 2022,Felt preachy,"I love the directors voice and that they made this movie. They are important for the film industry. My only complaint is that it felt like the slightly to well off mens attempting to make us see something fairly obvious about life. Although, I can't see anyone else being able to make this. It's a one of a kind film, by one of a kind film makers. I wonder what movie a poorer versions of these guys would come up with.

1 April 2023,Cow dung,"Absolute Cow Dung. More can not be said about this one.

The same goes for the Oscar judges or the board that decides which movie is the ""best picture"". The entire Oscar bandwagon must be dismantled. Both the movie makers and the Oscars are high on LSD or other such psychedelic substances. If the movie maker claims that I did not understand the movie because of my shallow I. Q, then these guys must anyway be banned or banished from making movies that are beyond the capacity of normal human intelligence(considering downcasting my I,Q is right). Our two hours were completely wasted on this tripe, and as somebody mentioned, it was a colossal waste of time, home electricity, apparatus wear and tear, and the family who was coerced by me to watch this because it was an ""Oscar's Gem"".

I would cordially invite Mr. Will smith to come to the podium and slap the whole oscar board for showering this misery on us.",1
10 June 2022,Solid 10/10,"Hands down probably the best movie I've seen in 2022. And top 10 all time. Great and tremendous acting. And the story makes you think and overall purpose is fantastic. Very emotional but that's ok. Only cons is it's alittle long but definitely a must see... that's it.

6 May 2022,"Art, Action, and Audaciousness","Creativity, breaking so many rules and yet tying everything together in a clear and relatable story arch. Visually stunning, too. CGI that completely serves the needs of the film.

Breathless action that veers into the ridiculous.

It's an audacious work of art. The best film of 2022. The best film of the 2020s. Certainly one of if not the best films of the 21st Century.

Gonna give it ten starts.

As a comedy, action, think piece, it doesn't perhaps land quite as powerfully on a single emotion as some other films. It covers too much ground. Also, my wife hates it, mainly because it was confusing and had some gross humor.",10
14 March 2023,Absolutely loved the madness,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

27 September 2022,Showing off,"I don't understand Why would a film maker need all this propaganda of shiny clothes, weird makeup, freaky characters, mixed up science fiction ideas to deliver a message to their audience.

I normaly root for new ways of filmmaking. Everything, everywhere, all at once is an innovative film. You will definitely not be able to anticipate what's about to happen, but it actually felt exhausting to keep up with it and after a while it wasn't worth it, because you realise it doesn't make sense, it's just for show, it's just to draw this big big attention wave with not much behind it but some simple messages.

15 April 2023,"A little exaggerated in the alphamultiuniversal trips, and fun in its acidic humor...","Evelyn Wang is a Chinese immigrant in the United States who has the tough mission to save the world by crossing several parallel universes and exploring all the lives she didn't get to live.

Her house is very familiar to me, and I go into autopilot mode often, do I live in a parallel world too... Full of meanings, and filled with analogy, using the insane madness of the Alphaverse as a subterfuge... An appeal to her universe to that everyone stop fighting and be kind even when life doesn't make sense... Although I spent half the film confused, I really enjoyed the reflections, a little exaggerated in the alphamultiuniversal trips, and fun in its acidic humor...

23 February 2023,Pretentious but visually impressive film.,"I saw her in the cinema a couple of days ago. It is a visually stunning film; I was kind enough to myself not to read about it so I could sustain the sense of surprise that is mandatory in these kinds of events. His idea is not original and we are used to the self-reference of the producers: the same directors of Avengers Endgame play with the concept of the multiverse in a more humorous tone, obviously linked to another work of theirs: Community. With a reference also to The Matrix we can then affirm that the creative sources are clear. What the film does stand out in is technical and acting. The main cast is competent and stands out with solid performances in what is undoubtedly a high-level challenge; there is material here for several Oscars. But the problem is the script: the youthful character that triggers the delirious arc of the film is severely unsympathetic and the mother's subsequent reactions are terrible. Here the delirium is dressed in morality and it is impossible to accept the sentimental conclusion of the script because it is unacceptable and dangerous. The basic idea is a young woman who wants to be accepted by her family and what follows is a journey of love and relationship recovery. To this sounding boring they added extraordinary elements that fortunately make drinkable something that would otherwise be unbearable. I was happy to see two of the most famous faces of the Martial Arts Club in their roles as security guards. It is a light but powerful film. It can be seen without much expectation.",6

15 March 2023,Awesome!,"Part fantasy, part action adventure, part drama and part comedy. Everything Everywhere All At Once is all of those things but most of all it has heart. It's about choices made learning what matters. It's so dreamlike and surreal but at its core it's about love and acceptance and kindness. Is it overly complicated? Yes and no. It's like life itself but on a grand scale that throws everything at us visually and keeps us guessing but that's like life we have to go through a lot to learn the simplest and most important things. This could have gone so wrong but thanks to a deft script, superb directing and editing and actors who take us convincingly on an incredible journey.

2 February 2023,what's with Hollywood and bagels?,"A little known piece of movie trivia. For the 1978 film Superman, when Marlon Brando was first hired to play Jor-El, father of Superman, he spooked the producers by explaining that, as a Method Actor, he was not sure if he should play the role as a giant bagel? What is it with Hollywood and metaphysics and bagels? This one of a kind film uses clever writing and excellent actors to explain Quantum Theory. Which, for those who care, is not 100% compatible with Einsteinian physics. The film is a wonderful experience, but is not truly entertainment. For example, it takes an entire half-hour just to connect with the viewer, runs too long, and is not likely to be your first choice for a re-watch. But it does take its special place in film history, and it definitely lingers. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

9 April 2022,Bonkers,"I'm telling everyone this is Multiverse of Madness!

But seriously, what a simple story shinning through a bursting-through-the-seams concept. When you settle down from all the trippy visuals and shinny lights, the crux of the story carried by the two amazing central ladies is what a movie's really supposed to be.

The concept of storytelling is there to complement the story and not the other way around. And frankly, this movie needs to be seen because no way of explaining it by memory to someone who hasn't seen it wouldn't do the film justice.

Love it or hate it, just go and see it for yourself. I promise you don't want to miss this one and see it later on a phone inside your room. Let the visuals and the loud sounds wash over you inside a sparsely populated theatre because this one will stay with you for a long time.",10
13 April 2023,Loving this hype backlash baby,"I saw this movie in March of 2022 on its opening weekend, not knowing anything about it. It was one of the most exciting movie experiences of my almost 40 years on this planet. The creativity and cleverness was just off the charts. People in my theater were howling with laughter at Racccocooie, hot dog fingers, and the butt plug fight. The acting was phenomenal, I could not believe the kid from Goonies pulled off that role the way he did. My gf and I literally walked out of the theater asking ourselves if we had just seen one of the greatest movies of all time.

However: I did not think this movie had a chance in hell at becoming an awards contender, and it is still blowing my mind that EEAAO kept up its hype for an entire year and won 7 Oscars. It's a very niche and weird kind of style.

Not surprisingly, the number of angry reviews being flooded onto here in the post hype backlash is a testament to the fact of EEAAO's highly specific sensibility. I can only say that I an glad so many others felt the same way as me in 2022 about the film, and that all these 1 star reviews, with their saltiness and utter confusion, are bringing me additional, infinite, everything bagel-sized joy.",9
5 June 2022,The Real Multiverse of Madness,"The movie is full of absurdities. The movie was very difficult to watch, but it was also fun. Acting was very very good. I liked the movie. Parallel universes were not bad, and traveling between parallel universes was also absurd and fun. Anyway i liked.

8 April 2022,Transcending.,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is the multiverse movie to end all multiverse movies. Following Evelyn Wang, a Chinese immigrant who is swept up in an insane adventure, where she alone can save the world by exploring other universes connecting with the lives she could have led. This film is hilarious, overstimulating, unique, stylistic, existential, life-affirming and deeply impactful, with every filmmaking aspect operating at a consistent masterclass level. Probably one of the most spectacularly fun theater experiences I've ever had. You can feel every piece of cinema which inspired this film, just as well as you can feel all of the future filmmakers who will be inspired by it, and we're likely to see its influence on the cinematic craft for decades to come. For the massive scope of the film, Everything Everywhere never forgets the human element which drives the film, a deeply profound and infinitely relatable story about the paths we take, and the importance of the things which matter in our lives over that which could have mattered. It's transcending. You will laugh, you'll probably cry. Most of my theater was doing both. If you're ever going to take a recommendation of mine, make it this. My sympathies for anyone who doesn't get to see this in a theater.",10
14 August 2022,The most accurately named movie title ever,"This is definitely the most difficult review I've written because when I think about this movie my mind is literally ""everything , everywhere, all at once"". The only comparison I have for it is like Inception meets Matrix.

There are definitely many ways to interpret the film but one major theme stood out to me. First, I think the biggest theme is that while nihilism may be easy to succumb to and even a tempting comfort , there is so much more to life if you open your eyes to everything around you and cherish the simple joys of life.

With regards to the movie itself, I wouldn't say that I was really enjoying it while watching, it is certainly overwhelming and difficult to keep up with, but all of its themes really made me reflect which certainly is valuable.

For this movie you truly need to watch it yourself because your interpretation of this movie is probably impacted by your own personal background and circumstances more than any other movie I've seen.",7
30 May 2022,Unique!,"There's really something for just about everyone in this movie. It's part Kung-fu action, part absurdist comedy, part cerebral sci-fi, and part indie family drama.

Everything, Everywhere dazzles with its creative vision, but it marries the bizarre and magical with the mundane and the ordinary to make a statement about human potential and how often we let our daydreams - what could have been, should have been, will or won't be - roadblock who we are. The movie obliterates the veil of ordinary to reveal the extraordinary, but it never loses itself within its relentless, wacky, metaphysical vision.

I don't really know who's ramming this movie down everyone's throats, but I've seen more plausible plots in old Troma movies. Here, the creators just throw everything at the screen, hoping something will stick. They figure if the plot/location/time/scene changes often enough, then people will be too busy trying to make sense of it all instead of realizing they're being duped.

I thought that it would be a good creative movie. Well I was wrong, it's not just good, it's great. Almost everything in this movie is fresh. So fresh that you just can't look away from the screen. The characters, the music, the action everything is very fresh.

If you want to watch something totally new just watch this movie. But if you don't like new concepts and ideas then just don't watch it. It's not for you.

Other than a very slightly drawn-out ending, it simply gets everything right.

Yang Ziqiong and Jonathan Ke Quan were both absolutely brilliant, start to finish.

The combination of action, sci-to, kung-fu, everyday life drama, misery, powerful emotional plays, subtle comedy, crude comedy, and the flat out weird, probably shouldn't work but completely did.

The scenes pulled their weight, the sound track did, the splashes of arthouse (which I generally dislike) fit in perfectly and worked so well.

31 March 2022,The idea is very interesting but the execution was not,"Sorry, 6 out of 10. I don't know what I've watched.

Don't get me wrong, The actors were great and I love parallel worlds/timeline stories which I dissect for others to understand. But this one? It was as if a newbie writer wrote a story with all the genres in the world and jammed it into a 2-hour movie with a lot of unnecessary sexual scenes.

The constant switching between universes were also very distracting. It is understandable, the idea is there, but they used it excessively. It is fine if done in novels but totally not in a live-action (or animation) show.

The comedy. Was it really necessary to add that genre? All the comedy scenes were funny but the tone of the story, the plot, it doesn't fit at all. The excessive use of comedy not only was a distraction but it killed the movie.

It started as science fiction, turned into sex fights, became a comedy, then a teenage drama.

It was fun at first. Then it dragged on and eventually ""what is the show about again?""",6

The story was intriguing the entire time, the cinematography was awesome, the editing was out of this world, and the acting was great all the way around. This movie had me laughing hysterically one moment and brought tears to my eyes the next. Overall, this is going to be the best movie of the year, if not the decade. 10/10.

3 February 2023,Nothing matters. Except the bagel,"I got excited after seeing the high rating. However this is another good concept wasted in the name of propaganda. When you combine time travel, alternate universe travel with emotions and good character arcs you can make great movies. Although I cannot even imagine what character arc would mean when time is not linear. It requires a great writer to write that script. These guys weren't.

First of all there were some really good ideas in the movie. Like crossing paths with the same guy and talking about alternate futures in the alternate universe. However the biggest 2 problems for me where the lack of any logic. You can create alternate universes but usually when you go beyond the lifetime of a person in any time travel movie, that person probably ceases to exist. So alternate branches of reality like sausage fingers and rocks should have been excluded. Also how did they achieve the same level of civilization without the ability to grab things. I though opposing thumb was one of the 3 key advantages over other apes.

Second issue is that the daughter lives all alternates realities, experiences everything, realizes that there is no difference in being a rock or human. She realizes ""nothing matters"". Except the ""bagel"" of course. She cannot give up the bagel and she will destroy the universe just to prove that she likes bagel. That part is the propaganda needed for an Oscar. And the part that made this movie absurd. At times it looked like ""scary movie"" or ""epic movie"" series. Bunch of absurd scenes stitched together.",6
13 March 2023,Recurrent and boring concept,"Recurrent and boring concept, and despite my interest for Asian cinematography (my first mistake, this movie is just Big Hollywood with three Asian American actors and a Malaysian actress), Jackie Chan action/comedies and super-hero sagas, this is definitely neither a mind-blowing nor revolutionary film.

Or maybe it is just the easy multi-meta-verse excuse that I cannot agree with (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) was amazing) and the ridiculous ""She's not most people"", bizarre ""Your coffee tastes wrong, our institutions are crumbling"".

Or it is the constant explanation of the whys and hows: ""In my universe..."", ""You will learn to Jump Verse""?

So when Evelyn (played by Matrix's Neo) asks Alpha Waymond (interpreted by Po in Kung Fu Panda) to ""explain it all to me, right now"" and he starts StarWarsing her, I had to quit.

In a nutshell, definitely not Oscar material.

Wait, what?",2
15 May 2022,Absurdity at its finest,"If you enjoy movies with lots of action, this movie is for you. If you enjoy movies with lots of emotion, then this movie is also for you. If you enjoy movies with well-written characters and a moving plot, then this movie is for you, too. This movie is pinnacle cinematography, from the special effects and costume design to the camerawork and acting. Every minute detail is purposeful, which can be somewhat overwhelming near the end. However, I promise that no matter what kind of viewer you identify as, there is something for you to love about this film. The cinematic experience offered is unlike anything you have ever witnessed, and if you are sensitive to philosophical and profound concepts, then you will dwell on this for many years to come.

13 June 2022,Strange but brilliant,"It's amazing how many people will say that a movie is bad just because they can't understand it and I've noticed that some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't even watch the whole film, how can you rate a film when you only watch part of it??

I have to be honest and say that I think that the first part of the film was a bit to long ( I would have given it a 9 but for that ) but overall an excellent film and well worth sitting through, a good storyline with some great special effects and interesting enough to keep you watching.

Happy watching.

2 July 2022,Watch this movie. You need it.,"Very impactful movie, i cant really imagine how they managed to write it and make a movie out of it.

This movie had a lot to teach with a lot of deep messages underneath the surface, it will take a little time to unpack all of it for anyone who watches it that is why it is a good movie.

The actors did a great job, and i noticed that the stunt guys from the martial club youtube channel are in this movie too, the same people who were in Shang Chi as well, they were hillarious in this one so i am happy for them : )

I am happy that i saw this movie, it elevates the standard for every movies out there.

4 April 2022,Optimistic nihilism and pure absurdity as the cure for existential dread many need right now.,"I would rate this a 9.5/10 if I could, not in the habit of giving out 10s as the perfect film seems impossible to achieve without cinematic obsession the likes of which would drive the average person to early death.

Regardless, EEAaO is a fantastic film. Think Kung Fu Hustle x John Dies at the End with a backbone of Mr. Nobody if all were the best possible versions of themselves and had more heart than all three combined.

Definitely one of the most daring, beautiful, and off-the-wall insane films I've seen in a long time.

High octane action flits back and forth to heartfelt tearjerkers and the absurdly hilarious, possessing a raunchy randomness only Daniels can evoke. Give them the multiverse and the Russo Bros, you've got a cohesive epic with excellent performances from everyone.

Genuinely moved by this film. Despite the exceptional components, it transcends these to become greater than the sum of its parts. I teared up on two separate occasions, all while the crowd was roaring throughout

I will need to see this movie a few more times to get every moment, as there is very little breathing and blinking room-one of my largest and only qualms was the lack of time spent exploring alternate paths to a degree I would like overall. This, however, ignores the message of the film which I believe has to do with optimistic nihilism or the idea that the meaninglessness of the universe is a chance to make your own meaning with what you have.

It's an important message that we all need to hear every once in a while. Hug someone close and tell them you love them; for all we know we only get one path-but make sure you scream it in a language they don't understand because life is unfair and absurd (Then take them to go see Everything Everywhere All at Once, it slaps).",10
31 May 2022,I was mesmerized. Until...,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

13 June 2023,Great Movie,"Rating: 9.1 Overall, a great movie that is very unique in how it blends many genres that is driven by its performances, writing, and action, but it does falter a bit from an inconsistent plot structure, fast pacing, and ending that is very feel good.

Very Good to Great Direction (Did a really good job in helping choreograph the different fight scenes, fast cuts in helping drive the narrative, and getting the most out of their actors in many different parts in the film; sometimes they do get lost is in their own pace as they cannot keep up with the fast pace they have created and did not do the best in helping bring the whole thing home), Good to Very Good Acting (Great from Michelle Yeoh (Really is able to command the film and show multiple dimensions in her performance as she helps the character grown from her insecurities to a confident lead in the end), Pretty Good to Good from Stephanie Hsu (Is fine in helping portray a multiple sided character that is a angsty teen with villain capabilities, but her performance can get really annoying at times as she plays too strong into the Villain and teen tropes to where her performance becomes a bit limited and annoying), Very Good from Ke Huy Quan (really steals the show sometimes as he still has that charm that Short Round had while still moving a bit past to show his ability to show multiple dimensions as an actor), Good from James Hong (Plays the typical character that he usually plays but does a good job in doing it), Good to Very Good from Jamie Lee Curtis (Shows her experience in the role and is able to be a monotonous anti-hero very well), Good from the rest of the cast), Very Good Story (Very good concept and does a good job in explaining the concept, the storytelling of the film is also very good as the audience is very captivated by what is happening and what will happen next; there are some issues with overall plot construction and how everything is distributed), Great Screenplay (Very witty and the jokes are very good, there is also a lot of symbolism present in multiple ways (even absurd ones)), Decent Score, Great Cinematography (really comes to light in the fighting scenes), Very Good Sound, Incredible Editing (Is used in a very good way in helping tell the story and show the different worlds the characters are going through in parallel), Decent Visual Effects (Is fine given the budget but can really show sometimes in how cheap it is), Good Makeup, Good Costumes (Helps in differentiating the different worlds), Plot Structure is the movie is a big issue as it is split into three parts but puts way too much into the first than the final two (especially the last one) as the final two parts feel a bit rushed (to where 10-20 minutes from the first part could be cut out and the exact same movie would be there), Pacing was incredibly fast to where many details can be lost if not paying attention (due to how content dense the movie is), Build to climax is very well done and a good epiphany for the main character as she learns her importance; climax was very underwhelming as it tries a bit too hard to be feel good to where it just feels incredibly forced and unrealistic, Tone of the movie is a bit unique as it blends multiple genres (whether it be martial arts, comedy, absurd comedy, and even drama), One of the better movies to tackle the multiverse as it is clear in how it explains it (though is still fast and dense)",9
28 June 2022,"Good, not great!","This movie is not bad at all, the message of the movie is that, accept your circumstances and moments and do not regret, otherwise if you want to have everything, it means you want to have billions of possibilities in your life, all your choices, then You become empty and you will not enjoy any of them.

She said "" There is something lovely about any situation, even the worst "" so you just have to accept your destiny and look at the half-full glass in any situation... I can not speak English very well, I'm sorry for the dictation mistakes. Google translate! :)))

6 January 2023,Emotions Everywhere All at Once,"As an avid movie watcher, I will say that this movie does in fact have everything, everywhere all at once. A two-hour movie that hums along and when I got to the end, I was out of breath. This movie has it all: rich characters, a solid plot and cinematography that blew my mind. On top of all this, there's a simple, yet profound message for all of us.

I can't say enough about this movie and how, after a few hours, it still resonates. I might have to watch it again as I know it will be time well spent. An absolute fascinating film that I didn't want to end. I rarely say that about a movie.

We will see these folks (everyone from director, cinematographer, producer, actors, editors) on stage come Oscar night.

29 December 2022,Whoa. What did I just watch?,"Whoa. What did I just watch? I'm not entirely sure, but I do know that I enjoyed most of it. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a bizarre, creative film about the multiverse. I honestly did not know what to expect the entire time I was watching it. Michelle Yeoh really shows her acting range in this movie, I loved seeing Ke Huy Quan again, and Jamie Lee Curtis was almost unrecognizable. However, the runtime is a little too long. Even with all the madness, it tends to drag in parts. And I also feel like they relied on hitting the shock humor button too often. Still, this was a fun, wild ride.

16 March 2023,"Utter Garbage trying to pass as ""Art""","This movie reminds me of modern fine art. Everyone knows it's absolute crap deep down and it takes far less talent than traditional art where an actual skill set had to be built up over years to make something look photorealistic or depict some religious scene. People will pay millions for trash modern art in attempt to seem unique.

EEAAO is akin to a Jackson Pollock painting. Some weirdo who thought he/she was really creative just flung ""artistic"" poo at the wall in a really weird way. The poo happened to align with tHe mEssAge somewhat so Hollywood began drooling all over it.

A few years from now absolutely no one will even remember this B-movie garbaggio that tricked a few drama nerds into caring about it.

28 April 2022,Once in a while a cult status movie is made. This is one them.,"Im still digesting what I watch from the information overload. This movie will be a I hate it or I love it. For me the latter. It is going to be no doubt one of those movies which will get the cult status. Best way to describe the movie is what would happen if you broomed all the edited clips from Sliders and Matrix and few other similar, and put them into a blender with some acid. The reason I enjoyed this movie because it was different and so refreshing change. I like art house movies and I say supporting well-known stars, advisors and was financed because they recognised the potential of something very unique here. Superhero style movie for adults with strong adult themes.

9 October 2022,"The real multiverse of madness that Marvel failed to make. If Nolan was asked to make a high-concept absurdist sci-fi flick, he would have made this film.","Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) : Brief Review -

The real multiverse of madness that Marvel failed to make. If Nolan was asked to make a high-concept absurdist sci-fi flick, he would have made this film. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert had an idea for a multiverse flick way back in 2010 - the same year when Christopher Nolan made ""Inception"". However, it took them a long time to gather things, and then we saw Marvel entering the multiverse zone with one of their most popular superheroes, Doctor Strange. It is strange that Everything Everywhere All at Once released in the same year when Doctor Strange and Wanda decided to go bonkers in the Multiverse of Madness. However, the film couldn't live up to the hype. But if you are amongst those who weren't satisfied with the Strange vs Wanda battle due to weak writing (like me), then make sure that you catch this high-concept entertainer. This absurdist sci-fi flick is expectedly weird, wild and awfully rubbish, but doesn't fail to entertain you with some crazy ideas and amazing sequences. The film tells the story of a Chinese woman who discovers that she must connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a powerful being from causing the destruction of the multiverse. There is much more to it that can't be spoiled, but yes, you can be warned and made prepared for emotionally intellectual topics like existentialism and Nihilism, with some absurd and yukk-ward moments. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan and James Hong have given good performances along with the brilliant supporting cast. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert deserve a big round of applause for their out-of-the-box thinking and audience-friendly vision. Neither Nolan nor Marvel could manage to deal with this high-concept topic by arranging the comedy in a perfect manner. The 2 Ds have done it. Except for children, this one is strongly recommended to everyone who loves watching unique entertainers.

RATING - 7/10*

21 March 2023,Amazing amazing screenplay!!!,"There are only few movies where the element of chaos form the central piece. The antagonist has no motive and only wants chaos to exist. And, the VFX and screenplay were simply superb is carrying out this theme throughout the movie.

There are long fingers, fancy dress and even a rock. The theme of chaos in the Chinese immigrant family with the conflict between nothing matters and being good is a meta philosophical treatment totally unexpected for this kind of ""time travel"" /""universe jumping"" film.

Kudos to the makers for coming up with such a novel idea. You have to watch this for the great storyline and acting performance!!!

6 January 2023,Unique movie,"Originally this movie didn't seem appealing to me because of the theme and characters, but I decided to watch it because of a WatchMojo best movies of 2022 video. The plot was a bit slow at the beginning, but it gets really intriguing when all the craziness of the multiverse is shown. I don't want to spoil too much, but the thing that I liked about the movie was how Evelyn could acquire different skills from different versions of herself from other universes. Towards the end it got a little bit confusing, but I understood what was happening just about and was kind of satisfied with the ending, but I do wonder what would've happend in the alternative ending.

Watching at home I had to do it in 3 sittings. It seemed that the only result the creators wanted was to make a movie that appeared profound.

I found it very visual and mostly tedious.

I made it through the end.

I was very surprised it all came together in the end. I couldn't tell you what it was about but I suppose it is all a personal experience.

Till this very date no female actor can perform better on screen martial arts then her.

As for the movie, if someone want's to see parallel universe based movie, Doctor Strange and SpiderMan multiverse are better to watch, far more entertaining, far more interesting and far more with simplest of logic.

The movie will certainly make you to pull your hair, a continuous state of confusion and just an eager to get over with it asap.

10 March 2023,Pretty Cool,"Although the multiverse concept can be incredibly confusing at times and its full of hilarious slapstick humor and wild action, I quite liked the messages of the movie. That people can reach their full potential, that just one decision can change our lives in many ways, that via the symbolism of googly eyes; one can make the cruel reality of this world into something kind and silly.

Now the costuming, effects, lighting etc is of an incredible quality; it really sucked me straight into the many worlds of the movie. And the psychadelic soundtrack paired with epic effects gave the feeling of being trapped within an extremely surreal fever dream.

I liked this movie, it's weird but has its own special place in Hollywood. And the actors were incredible.

12 February 2023,Maybe overrated?,"At the beginning I was really bored, but I can't deny that it got better and more interesting later, but still, eleven Oscar nominations for this? I'm not sure. To be honest I'm not sure if I liked the movie or not. I think it was worth to watch but didn't impress me that much.

The movie obviously had some impressive scenes and dialogues but they were really a few. And as the title of the movie says it is literally about everything all at once, but is that a good thing? I mean mentioning so many concepts at a very superficial level? Is it good? I think that is why I couldn't emotionally connect to the movie or it didn't make me think that much. Adding so many ingredients to a salad doesn't necessarily make it delicious, maybe you can show off with that but still it's not delicious! I feel the same about this movie, it was just too much and not that deep.

One other thing I didn't like about the movie is that I think it is like a collage of many other movies and animations. There are many scenes that remind us of other movies, (Rick & Morty for example) which I don't think is a good thing. But I also wonder maybe the directors did that on purpose to kind of mock the film industry? Not sure.

Also sometimes during the movie I thought it doesn't make any coherent sense, and I felt like the directors must had been on drugs. :D

But I kind of liked the way they showed parallel worlds, it was a bit overwhelming at the beginning but I think this theory itself is overwhelming so they did an okay job on this, even though I'm waiting for a better movie about multiverse! (Haven't seen and impressive one so far.) And the humor was not bad, not that impressive either. It made me laugh out loud at a few scenes.

Overall I think it was okay but not great.",6

The overall idea and execution is good but the major theme of kindness, family first, mother daughter is rather hammered through. At running time of 2.20, it could use some critical editing.

JLC is hilarious here and so is KHQ as the male lead. Michelle Kwan still got it to take the helm and the daughter is a good surprise.

A hilarious, emotional, shocking, touching, unpredictable, deeply woven science-fiction/action/comedy/romance/drama all wrapped around one struggling family just trying to do their taxes & run a laundromat. Superb acting from everyone involved, completely bonkers writing/editing, and an excellent score.

29 May 2022,Been a long time since I fell inlonve with a film.,"Probably the BEST I've seen in recent years.

It struck fast, it struck hard, it struck everything everywhere all at once.

If you take a moment to disconnect from popular media and judge the movie as it's own you'll love it even more. Comparing it to Matrix, Rick & Morty, Back To The Future and whatnot - it's all pointless and makes you miss the feeling of the film itself.

I can feel so much similarity with the absurdism & nihilism ""The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy"" offered me. On purpose or not, it matters less, but the feeling of having to deal with the absurdity of life with a straight face - Absolutely stunning and hitting. Just like the book series I mentioned.

Of course, if you don't enjoy or handle less well dark comedy & fast yet complicated plot, don't force yourself. But if you push past the discomfort and try and focus on the philosophical points of the film - I doubt you'll regret it. I've seen so many people miss the point by complaining about the humor or similarity to other things, which is an absolute shame. I don't mind people not liking certain stuff, but for the love of god, at least UNDERSTAND the film first.",10
20 April 2022,Most underrated film of 2022,"This is one of the most random movies I have ever seen but yet i believe it is also one of the best and most underrated films out there. With many films over the last 5 years are creating stories on multiverse theory, this film puts it own take on it. Not only does it bring a diverse cast but everyone's acting is on point. It brings a mixture of drama, comedy, action on what I like to describe as spider man meets the matrix meets terminater. There is a lot of growth in this film especially with cross generational difference of opinion which leads to acceptance. I highly suggest everyone watch this film.

27 March 2023,"Wonderfully dizzying, albeit too much to handle at times","Everything Everywhere All at Once is an Asian American indie drama cleverly disguised as a hilarious quirky Marvel-like adventure. With its inventive hyperactive script, it is a breath of fresh air amid the superhero blockbuster era and a role of a lifetime for Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan with a full showcase of their talents.

Evelyn Quan, a Chinese American immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband Waymond Wang, is having a bad day. The laundromat is being audited by the IRS, Waymond is about to serve Evelyn divorce papers and their daughter Joy wants Evelyn to accept her Caucasian girlfriend Becky.

Written and directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinhert, otherwise known as The Daniels, the story, to quote Mel Brooks' Spaceballs, moves at ludicrous speed.

It's entertainingly dizzying keeping up with the zaniness. When the multiverse adventure begins, the film revels in irreverent humor and unapologetically indulges in its weirdness.

It's all too much to handle, but fun. I was admittedly lost in the second chapter. Everything made enough emotional sense to carry me through despite that I was struggling to explain how it all worked.

I am happy that Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars. It's exciting to see that the hype was on their side as they swept the Golden Globes and all the other acting accolades leading up to the Academy Awards. Both actors showed an incredible amount of range in their parts. Who can do drama, comedy, fight and do their stunts in one movie like this?

Years ago, Everything Everywhere All at Once would have just been an indie sleeper on the top of the Best Films of the Year You Missed list. Now, it's a zeitgeist movie and the film everybody everywhere is talking about it.

Weirdness is trending. How times have changed...",7
8 April 2022,"Cool, unique and family drama under sci-fi","It might be the first time i cried since spirited away. I despise rating system, and i don't normally do this. Cause reviews are subject and sometimes way too personal.

But Everything Everywhere All at Once is just built different. I didn't expect to get that much experience watching a film with the tacky multi-universe sketch. But i'm genuinely surprised and overwhelmed by how good it helps the plot. This design is not just used to create a Nolan-ish crazy high-budget scene, but serves as a perfect bridge to the ending.

The ending just makes me bawl like a baby. Again, any asian child or any child can relate so much to this movie. Wonderful, wonderful job from the two Daniels.

5 May 2022,It was great. I think.,"It's unexplainable and I don't know where to begin but it was great. I think. Definitely different and ORIGINAL. I was lucky to be in the States when this came out and all I can say for sure is its expertly done and the three main character are really excellent and full of charisma. But I still don't understand what was actually going on. Maybe that's the point?? Or was it too much of everything all at once??

12 January 2023,Rare gem,"One of the few movies succeeding in touching both raw and elevate minds. Like Matrix 1 did, for example.

I was surprised by the number of directing instruments used and by the depth of the script. Surprised by the choices made during the narration.

By the fluidity of sequences that were apparently separated. It was amazing how small but essential suggesting images were insterted in specific moments/ places to potentiate some ideas.

In one word : wow.

And final thought for the haters: i do not expect everyone understands some of the idea toched by this movie. However i am amazed by people not understanding, but rejecting.",10
14 April 2023,Like a modern-day Matrix with a comedic spin,"EEAaO is something that you most certainly have never seen before. Closest thing I can ascribe it to is something like a modern-day Matrix film. It's an incredibly unique assault to the senses, in a mostly good way.

The universe-hopping premise makes a great backdrop for some great set pieces (we all know about that hilarious trophy fight), but I found the plot about a mother's waning relationship with her daughter that was wrapped around it to be what made the film. It's easy to write this film off as just nonsense, and it can come off as that sometimes, but it does have a touching moral to it underneath its bombastic, epileptic exterior.

I think its biggest issue is that it goes on for a bit too long - there were several moments when I thought the film was wrapping up, but it just kind of kept on going. With so much going on ""all at once"", it can also get pretty much. By the end of the film, I was thoroughly exhausted.

Pretty good film, overall. Best picture? Probably not in my opinion, but still worth watching, if only just the one time.",7
29 March 2023,What a joke. Best movie of the year? What??!!,"Seriously. What a joke. The Oscars have never been by far any sort of guidance for me, but I can't help feeling curious about the movies they award. This is probably the most irrational one of all time.

I can't agree with ANY of the aspects awarded by the Academy, it's a seriously flawed movie, with a very weak script and dialogs, average performances (when not lousy), mediocre cinematography and repetitive cheap humour.

The story tries to be complex but it's just messy. I understand what's going on and what it wants to say, but its choppy editing and frenetic pace is just unenjoyable and uninteresting. I literally fell asleep in the cinema, and thought of walking out at least twice but stayed to the end to really see if there was any redeeming value in it. There wasn't.

Part of the boredom and walking out feeling was the cringe dialog. It got me rolling my eyes throughout the last hour, especially at the end with all that speech and preaching about life and love and blah, blah, blah.. terrible. After watching two hours of cheap, quirky, repetitive and unfun humour and cheap choreographies don't come to me trying to be serious and dramatic (and clich√©) because it's not the time or place.

Best actress??? WHAT??!! None of the performances were worthy of big praise! It's a cheap looking action flick, what the hell?!

The costumes and set design are quite horrible. Seriously. Costume design got another award! What is it to praise about a costume made of teddy bears? Originality? NO. Hard work? NO. Is it interesting? NO. Sets are just boring. I don't remember a single one that was interesting or at least looked good. Even the ""final fight"" was lame. That's part of the poor, uninteresting cinematography, below average. I've seen LOTS of TV shows that look WAY better than this ""Academy award winner"". Again, what a joke.

It's not even a case of high expectations, it never looked amazing in the trailer for me. I was interested in the concept, and as I said, the awards made me curious, but if it hasn't won all those prices, I'd be trashing it anyway, because it's a really bad movie for me.

Finally, I have to say, as an action/fighting movie, it's also very mediocre. The choreographies are average, nothing I haven't seen in a Jackie Chan's TV movie on a Sunday afternoon. Seriously boring.

I even find disrespectful how this movie got the prize against the other WAY BETTER movies competing.

And again, WHAT A JOKE.

Awards aside, this is a bad movie.",4
19 January 2023,Hauntingly Beautiful,"This movie absolutely consumed me from the first second. My entire being, soul and all, aches in awe of this film. This movie transcends genre and should be considered essential viewing for all audiences. A story of immense loss and heart-breaking love, the actors' performances completely draw you in and make you forget that you are outside of it. So incredibly silly at times, and yet personally relatable on so many fronts. The hype is absolutely real and should be heeded; you will not experience a film like this again for a very long time. Your heart will yearn for what you see, and yet you will see yourself in their shoes at many turns. Just absolutely bloody brilliant. Bravo!

18 April 2022,"This is a Love Story, a Mind-Bending Love Story, Told Through Many Lives and Many Loves","This movie is about a woman who is a wife and mother. She is also a daughter to her aging father. It's about her struggles with all of these roles in differing universes.

This movie is about life and lives that could've been and maybe are. It's about love that should've been and maybe never were.

It's told beautifully and interestingly in such a way that just as in the film, time itself has no meaning or concept as you sit in your seat in the theater watching the screen.

Also, just as in life, in this movie, all is shown here but it is told is three announced chapters: Everything, Everywhere, and lastly, All At Once.

There are tremendous action sequences, laugh out loud comedic scenes, and dramatic dialogue-driven sequences that are needed to propel the story forward like a slingshot, that are needed make the heart soar just as much as other times it can make the heart break.

This will be one of 2022's greatest films in a year that has thus far been unexpectedly packed early on with some fantastic titles.

Everything Everywhere All at Once has it all. And you should be there to see it all. At least once.",10
31 May 2022,My favorite film of 2022 is one for the ages,"I was skeptical due to the multi-verse storyline, which I've honestly had little interest in exploring historically speaking. That said, the combination of the cast and A24 intrigued me enough to put my multi-verse prejudice aside and go in with an open mind.

Though it took until the second act to really come together for me, the set up was essential for letting the elaborate story unfold. There were a few times I thought it was trying to do too much, but that idea would subside with each action sequence or poignant moment between the truly lovable characters.

In terms of comparisons; it has shades of 'Matrix' (R. I. P.) but with far more heart, humor and creativity. There was a Charlie Kaufmann-esc depth to the script that ultimately drew me into this world of infinite imagination. Unlike Kaufmann, Daniels ('Swiss Army Man') have a dramatically more optimistic view of human nature that I found both refreshing and necessary considering the world we find ourselves in post COVID.

The third act is transcendent in every sense of the word. Without giving away too much, I can say for certain that they stick the landing with such poise here that I found myself misty eyed and laughing for a solid 30 minutes. It's rare that a film -let alone a science fiction film with an unlikely combination of characters- elicits such a profound emotional response from me. From what I've been seeing and hearing I'm not alone there. A+

On a related note, I would place 'Everything Everywhere All At Once' right behind 'Moonlight' and 'Ex Machina' as my top A24 film to date. Kudos once again to the greatest independent entertainment company in existence.",10
12 June 2022,Awesome,"This film was amazingly executed, with a film that has so much ground to cover it is very easy to run the story too long, but this film has the perfect run time for it. The acting is outstanding as well.

Overall, 8/10.

27 February 2023,Genius. Deserves all the accolades,"My first review! Well because everything everywhere touched places in my heart that I didn't know exist! It is a movie about all those broken dreams and desires that we keep telling ourselves before giving up. All those parallel dimensions where we could be anything but this present version of ourself, where we feel so trapped that unknowingly we keep pushing our loved ones away. Letting go or not, and how sometimes expressing love can heal or start the journey towards healing, is shown through breathtaking graphics and beautiful acting! Very rarely a movie makes me this happy and this joyful!

26 July 2022,a Marvel movie done by Satoshi Kon,"EEAaO is a great movie for a new generation, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to folks who aren't into high paced movies where you have to pay attention. People who aren't unsure should maybe check out the music videos those two guys directed first to give you a hint. I'm saying that only because I have seen audiences leaving the cinema halfway through the movie, which is a great sign in my opinion. But it is also a double edged sword: it cuts really deep, but sometimes less is more. There are a lot of over-indulgent parts, especially when it comes to running jokes and the 4th act. I think this could have been edited down to a good half an hour, since the catharsis overstays it's welcome.

It's still a great movie regardless, since I always prefer highly original material. Although there is a huge amount of hommages from many famous movies, one that stuck with me after the movie is the editing. There is an element of Satoshi Kon's editing style in how previous scenes are being re-contextualized in a collage of time and space. It's a concept Kon was famous for and Nolan seems to be still striving for. It's really interesting to see other diretors applying this concept. Since I watched Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness two weeks ago, the comparisons came up necessarily while I was watching. And I was wondering why this movie feels so much better than Doctor Strange in that regard. Obviously there are characters you truly care about here who amount to more than quips.

I honestly prefer Swiss Army Man over this one, but I'm glad that DANIELS is back and hope to see more movies from them in the future. It is truly a great ride once you embrace it.",7
13 May 2022,What Matrix 4 should have been.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

14 September 2022,It's hard to make a movie about the multiverse,"It's a complex film that spans a variety of themes, but does each one justice with a carefully written script, wonderful performances, and a healthy dose of bizarre humor to counteract its bleak story. It's a strange movie because it's brave with its creative decisions; as well as rare, but without getting lost along the way. An entertaining and moving story that is testimony to the ambitious and ingenious vision of its filmmakers and the immeasurable talent of its protagonist. It can occasionally feel excessive, but the directors pause for emotional beats that lend weight to the chaos. The noise is part of the experience, but sheer creativity is the reward.

16 March 2023,Terrible and bring movie,"I can't say any good word about this movie. Utterly boring, couldn't understand what was the storyline. I don't know how what was nominated and won so many Oscars?!!Was it sci-fi? I had to make myself watch this to the end. I'm so glad I didn't have to pay for it. Was this worthy of an Oscar?!'Not To Me!! Was it even in the category of Shindler' list"" to win so many Oscars?!' No! I'm sorry it had no storytelling. I had no idea what it was trying to say. I had to drag myself into two hours of watching this. Acting was OK. But what was it trying to say. To be kind to another and accept each other?! Not sure how can anyone sit through this.

12 May 2022,ALMOST EVERYTHING I EXPECTED,"This is a fun rollercoaster romp across the multiple dimensions of familial relationships. A fantastic metaphor for dealing with inter-generational despair and disappointment. The gags made me burst out laughing at times and yet the core message was much deeper. That of forgiveness and the the strength of family bonds. Not subtle but fun.

That said, I felt the movie was 10 or 15 minutes too long and could have been edited down to keep my attention.

Yeoh is fantastic as ever. A great watch just to see her! Took me a while to recognise Jamie Lee Curtis. I reckon her best performance ever!!

25 February 2023,One of my top 5 movies of all time,"I went into this movie not knowing what was going on. No idea what the story was, not knowing the premise, and just watching everything unfold throughout was the best way to watch it. It was hilarious, emotional, thought provoking, and it was entirely fueled by Michelle Yeoh's undying commitment to the role. Also, Ke Huy Quan returning to the big screen in years was refreshing. Jamie Lee Curtis being able to adapt to a role, and keep is wondering what's happening with her is amazing. The movie as a whole was a refreshing, original idea, and it dives into the mindset of each character, and what they're going through. It's a phenomenal film.

27 January 2023,Well... I'm still processing.,"First of all, not a bad movie as many are review as a low 3/10.

The movie has some flaws, but overall they are not enough to receive crap reviews. But also, movie is not great.

It starts really good, and get pumped really hard and that's good thing, but then it all start happening really out of sense, the rules of the multiverse start to be broken (for the purpose of the film, which is a bad thing in my opinion) and physics... breaking physics really took me out of the fights (stupid fights)((but good fighting moves).

The concept was great, the story was good, movie to watch once in a few years. Lead and supporting actor were good. VFX good.

2 January 2023,"Absolutely exemplary, truly brilliant, difficult to even put into words","Let's be frank: It's not possible to overstate how brilliant this film is. Filmmakers Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have given us a movie that is, truly, everything and everywhere, scattered and all over the place, nothing and all simultaneously. There is no stone left unturned, no inclusion to outlandish, far-fetched, and absurd to lump together, no idea that isn't thrown at the wall. Kwan and Scheinert have given us a hodgepodge mishmash smorgasbord as outrageous as 1967's 'Casino Royale,' 'Beyond the valley of the dolls,' 'Attack of the killer tomatoes,' every most preposterous B-movie, every most senselessly pompous and grandiose blockbuster, and every hopelessly overcooked blend of genres all smashed together into one picture. By all reason, this should be a horribly sloppy, nonsensical, blustery low-grade fancy of the sort we'd expect to see from Jim Wynorski, Charles Band, J. R. Bookwalter, The Asylum, Uncork'd Entertainment, or gods know what else. Instead, it's one of the most singularly imaginative, ingenious, flawlessly well made, stunning, captivating, entertaining features that has possibly ever been made. 'Everything everywhere all at once' is an instant modern classic, a true masterpiece.

There's no reason whatsoever why any of this should work as well as it does. Absurdism, surrealism, profundity, major drama, martial arts, science fiction, action-comedy, parody, satire, obscenity, racism, homophobia, animal cruelty, love, abject cartoonishness, family, universality, morality, kindness and cruelty, weakness and strength, nihilism and hope, unreserved bombast, art film loftiness, warmhearted sincerity, fierce violence - all this and much, much more, in a bizarre, kaleidoscopic cacophony of 139 minutes. Such far-flung notions apply to every single last aspect of the feature, even the aspect ratio. Sound effects, sound design, cinematography, direction, editing, lighting, costume design, props, effects, hair, makeup, production design, art direction, characters, dialogue, scene writing, the story, plot development, mechanics of the multiverse, music, choreography, pacing, comedy, messaging, tone, and more are all subject to the same wild whims wholehearted earnestness and indulgence, flipping in an instant from one mood or concept to another perhaps multiple times in the same scene. This is to say nothing of the acting, with everyone in this amazing cast giving extraordinary performances of arguably greater versatility than has ever been required of anyone in one other particular title. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jenny Slate, Tallie Medel, and all others involved turn in displays wholly unlke anything else they've ever done. I'm simply astounded.

To discuss anything about this film, any one single element, would require a vast quantity of words far exceeding the space one is typically allotted. To discuss the picture at large, in substantial detail, almost seems like a Herculean task. All that I can say is that the title speaks as much to the content, and every small facet represents, as it does to the unremitting, all-consuming panoply of ideas that informed the work of the filmmakers, the cast, and the crew. From top to bottom, left to right, and inside-out, 'Everything everywhere all at once' is both overwhelming and not enough, wonderfully satisfying and rewarding but never leaving us sated, farcical and sensible, haphazardly kluged and precisely calculated - too much, and not enough. In recent years there have been multiple highly acclaimed and very popular movies that have played with the idea of the multiverse, and it's at best questionable if any of them have struck a chord of originality, a spark of genius, in the way that this has. While I heard nothing but good things about EEAAO and anticipated enjoying it before I sat to watch, never in my wildest dreams could I have been prepared for what it actually is. It's so over the top that I can't imagine it will appeal to everyone, yet crafted with such extreme passion and care, and bound up with such welcome, heartfelt authenticity and humanity, that it speaks directly to everything that audiences love about the medium in the first place. This is the type of picture that, love it or hate it, everyone needs to see at least once. I'm blown away. 'Everything everywhere all at once' is absolutely incredible, and isn't to be missed.",10
13 July 2022,Maybe I'm missing something...??,"I can imagine that some people would really like this film. I mean, it has a lot in it- action, comedy, wildly unexpected twists.

But personally, I need to really understand what's going on, and be invested, to sit through a full 2 hour 20 minute film. It took me a while to get my head around what was happening and by the time I did, I didn't really care.

The characters were alright. They definitely tried to flesh them out, but with the exception of Joy, the daughter, I didn't really care about any of them.

Overall, it just felt very average and I was checking how much was left to sit through from the 90 minute mark.

22 March 2023,This winner is another example that the ACADEMY has no relevance,"I quit watching the Academy Awards a long time ago because it started choosing losers like this. Even the Producers (or whoever decides to lease movies to streaming services) had little faith that this movie could win BEST PICTURE. It's on Prime Video instead of being re-released to theatres. I suffered through the first 30 minutes & quit. Then i decided i should try to finish it to write this review. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. Even though i like Michelle Yeoh, this was not a superior performance.. Ke Huy Quan has a similar look to Jackie Chan & also looked a lot like him in the fighting sequence at the IRS office. I don't hate his Academy win. For me, this is nothing more than a B movie which the Academy now seems to champion.

It's rare I find a movie that is so human that you experience the gamut of emotions in one film. All of the actors were great and the characters well written. I laughed, I cried, I sympathized, rooted for, identified with, saw myself in some parts, it hit some inner child wounds, had me deep in philosophical thought and made me contemplate human nature...all in all it was a spiritual experience.

Human connection, The Human Condition, Family Dynamics and Dysfunction, Our Connection to the Universe.... I couldn't believe what I had seen and couldn't wait to see it again I knew that when I did I would see even more in it.

When they get it right it's like having an out of body experience and this is what seeing this movie the first time did.

Michelle Yeoh deserves all the awards possible for her acting very few people could pull this role off and she did it brilliantly.

What I really appreciated most were the obvious metaphors for mental health and the need for human connection and family support done in such a transcendent yet digestible way.",9
3 July 2022,beyond imagination,"See!? That's all I'm saying. Humanity is overrated. We're smaller than we think... I always impress by this kind of movies & series like Westworld.

I love the casting of the movie especially Ke Huy Quan but I couldn't get in touch with Stephanie's acting.

The story was beyond my imagination. Maybe the first hour of the movie was kind of boring but it was totally worth it. Only problem that I have with this kind of movies is that most of them have a happy ending. I don't know maybe eventually we have to enjoy little things in our life and say: yes we know that we are nothing in this universe and we can't do anything, but we're happy!...

10 May 2022,This put shame to Multiverse of Madness,"Okay so Doctor Strange 2 was good but it's name was very misleading as they didn't even explore much about Multiverse. Coming to this movie, first of all, I found this movie very confusing and so I had to watch it's explanation later. One thing I had in my mind, why they chose Asian family? Could the same story be true about any other race? Later my friend told me it's because Asian parents they are very bad at showing their love to their childrens and the story centrally revolves around expression of love and choices.

10 September 2022,Fever Dream,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is most definitely a highlight of this years catalog of cinema releases despite its flaws. Its wildly imaginative and has a radical new take on the multiverse concept. Its endlessly imaginative and really feels like a film where literally anything could happen. Its also really well crafted, especially for its budget. Its even more of an achievement given that it was made during the pandemic. Despite this I did find myself wishing there was more use of animation perhaps with the racacoonie sections.

Its by no means perfect though and has some significant flaws. It at times, like with the films of Wes Anderson, finds itself stylistically being quirky for the sake of being quirky due to a desire to have a unique and signiture auteurist style. This maximalist, post-modernist fever dream aesthetic is at times quite detrimental to the experience. One find themselve overwhelmed and confused, and the swifty pacing can makes it difficult to keep up. This sensation is also contributed by it being bursting with too many ideas and I think it should have been cut down. It definitely feels detrimentally long which is in part contributed to by in the third act every scene feeling like its the grand finale.

Overall its a brillianly funny and imaginative film which poeple will be talking about years from now. Despite its flaws I would highly recommend watching it. There really is nothing like it.",7
29 January 2023,Multi layer masterpiece!,"Give this movie all the awards!!!

This is one of those special/rare movies that we only get once a decade. To not watch it would be making a huge mistake. There are so many layers to this movie.... the storytelling, the cinematography, the perfect editing, the incredible acting, the perfect dialog, the amazing effects, the topics that it explores, the lessons it teaches, the widsoms it shares.... and that's just the beginning of it. There is so much more in this movie. It's the kind of movie you have to watch at least a few times. Once is just not enough.

The scene with the two stones was probably my favorite one. So incredibly original.

This movie breaks all the molds and completely shattered all my expectations. I was constantly on the edge of my seat. I didn't know what to expect next and I knew that it wouldn't be more than a few seconds before something wild, crazy, totally unique and unexpected happened next.

This movie is truly ""everything, everywhere, all at once.""",10
20 May 2022,Everything except impressive,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

10 May 2022,An ode to Chinese migrant mothers,"This movie was a fantastic telling of a Chinese migrant's story in an English speaking country. It's the story of my mother, and many others like her.

These women left all that was familiar and known for a country where they did not speak much of the language, or understand much of the culture. They left when most people are in their prime, when their potential was just about to blossom, and went to run a small business and live frugally so that their children could have a brighter future. But that future is a sea of unknown possibility, one that cannot be controlled, or even necessarily understood.

Michelle Yeoh does an incredible job (as she always does) of portraying a woman who is coming to terms with the internal conflicts of her past sacrifices, emotional trauma, cultural expectations, the love for her daughter, her relationship with her husband, and the harsh, unforgiving realities of running a small business in the US. Ke Huy Quan similarly amazes with his acting ability, becoming switching between different versions of the same man at the drop of the hat and portraying the typically misunderstood and underestimated, quietly spoken Asian man to perfection.

The story is about how our internal conflicts can both hinder and help us on our path to reconciliation and becoming the best versions of ourselves through choice and acknowledgement.

As a first generation migrant to an English speaking country from Hong Kong, I want to thank the entire movie team for their kind, nuanced, entertaining and heartfelt telling of our mothers' migrant stories. For telling this story in its messy entirety, and not just settling for a hygienic, polite version reiteration of migrants achieving the American dream, you have done us all an enormous service.",10
24 May 2022,Not for everyone,"Know what to expect...the idea is great and wonderful but the practical filmography and scenes that were VERY out there and extravagant is not for everyone. Personally to me it was too much, and I enjoyed some parts but would not necessarily watch it again or recommend.

16 January 2023,Highly Overrated,"Not the popular opinion, but this one is another disappointing multiverse outing.

Unlike Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness, this one received overwhelming positive reviews which was the very reason for me giving this movie my time. But it turned out to be a dud. It took me to the verge of giving up after the first hour, and thought it might get better but alas not. Performance wise cheers for Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. Other than that, it's silly and takes you on a skippable acid trip.

Bottom line: Definitely not worth the hype. Watch it without any expectations and you just might like it.

Watch it on Amazon Prime Video.

5 June 2022,Good,"I gotta say, the film made with such meticulous passion. I think it's a good film, but not a groundbreaking movie with lots of potential. Some emotional heartwarming moments and exceptional choreography. The emotional moments in this film were strong and tear-jerking.

It's a cinematic achievement that they made this movie with just $25 million. It looks and feels more expensive, especially the cinematography and the brilliant VFX works.

10 September 2022,Pure ...,"This film is not only unique in decades but has never seen such a picture in history. I don't want to say which movie is better or not. This is a great human art. The same thing we feel when we read a perfect story without being a storyteller. This film has enough knowledge of classic cinema and made in such a way that the perfection is easily felt in it . I personally cannot ignore the place of this film in the history of cinema. A completely human film. Without any confrontation and at the same time without causing any disturbance in his pure and pure art. A film that is not artificial. It's easier to say, for centuries, no one has designed such an image that is so deep. It has nothing to do with ideology.

I'm just talking about the artistic texture of the film.

The unique realism of the story in the heart of such a structure is truly magnificent.

24 May 2022,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) leads a hard, somewhat complicated life with her argumentative daughter, Joy, with whom she does not gel, a disappointed and demanding father who she still seeks to impress and a crumbling marriage to Waymond, Ke Huy Quan. She is also in trouble with the IRS regarding her laundromat in the shape of IRS auditor Jamie Lee Curtis.

Suddenly a version of Waymond from the Alphaverse tells her that Jobu Tupaki is out to destroy her and the universe, so she must draw on her skills and powers from the many other Evelyns across the alphaverse to defeat her.

It would be meaningless to try to explain or indeed do justice to the many elements of this bizarre plot. Often very funny, sometimes quite sad, it for the most part travels at incredible speed, featuring endless amazing and bewildering images that feed, ultimately, what this is about - there's no place like home. In watching this highly regarded, popular and soon to be ultimate cult film, it is perhaps understandable why some will find this a pretentious mess, but for those that do like a film on the edge that you are unlikely to completely take in on your first viewing - you do need to concentrate - it's best just to sit back and let it wash all over you and enjoy. There are no films like this - I did briefly feel it might be a very distant cousin of 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' but it is definitely its own beast and incredible to think it came out of America.",7
6 April 2023,What in the heck was somebody thinking?,"This is the second movie from this year's Oscars that I have seen and thought was STUPID!

I admit, I'm not a fan of multi-verse plotlines. But, you know, a similar plotline was in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And that story was great! So, I know that odd plotlines can be great.

But this plotline seemed like it was written by two high-schoolers who made up weird stuff for the characters to experience. I tried watching the movie three times, moving forward from where I had quit. And still, I just didn't care.

So, no spoilers in this review. If you like movies that are intelligent, with great dialogue and super acting - THIS IS NOT IT!

It was an awesome, action-packed action movie that also had amazing acting and also had great humor and also had amazing production design, but it also had something to say, something quite profound about the state of life and how we should cherish it.

Beneath all this mess there is a valuable lesson in here: Nothing matters. Nothing what we do or have done matters because it's all going to be forgotten at some point and the world will end. So why bother? Why try to enjoy anything? The solution according to the movie is, because we can do it together. And it does have some truth in it. Even the worsts things are better if we have someone to lean on.

6 April 2023,Fun but overrated,"You want a feel good film with a very original idea operating on a low budget with an impressive vision, this film's for you. Some of the scenes are truly fantastic in terms of visual scope. I do enjoy the film, and if it was on - especially towards the end - I'd stick it through to see if my opinion changes. Though I believe in a few years this film won't be remembered or degraded for some of the stupid stuff in this.

I must admit - I HATE the action, every time a plug was being shoved up a rectum for comedic effect I scoffed. When the action started I just wanted to go back to the dialogue and characters which were compelling. The comedy isn't really that funny and more like if you asked a 13 year old what they laugh at. The endings quite cliche and happy which works with the film, but after a while you understand where it's going and that makes the film go down.

The acting is fine. Michelle Yeah and Ke Huy Quan are great in their roles. However, Jamie Lee Curtis is extremely overrated and Stephanie Hsu is criminally underrated, undoubtedly she deserved to win over some bumbling, narc with a funny way about them. Hsu's character is complex and damaged and just 100x better.

Good, not great, and a solid film from the Daniels who realised their vision quite expertly, but it all comes down to taste and I don't like stuff like Rick and Morty - that show is smart, not funny. The film's the same. I understand why people would emotionally resonate with the film but I just don't.

Didn't deserve Best Picture, Martin McDonagh deserves that for underrated tragedy Banshees of Inisherin.",7
1 May 2022,This is cinema. - Martin Scorsese,"""Every new discovery is just a reminder that we're all small and stupid.""

The rumours are true! Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the finest pieces of film of all-time. An instant-classic, a movie you know will stick with you for a long time, something you'll be constantly referencing and recommending to your friends. This is why I love cinema, this is why people go to the movies, this is why strangers meet in a dark room with a giant screen in front of them. To be able to feel connected with everyone, to make sense of this thing we call life, to just forget all our problems for an hour or two and be transported to another universe.

This did a lot for me. It really did. It payed my taxes, walked my dog, payed my university bills, took the trash outside, cleaned my windows and filled every single inch of my heart with emotion. I crackled, sobbed and was left in a beautiful state of awe. But then again what else would you expect from a Comedy/Action/Science-fiction/Drama/Sausage/Romance movie directed by the amazing, creative, evil geniuses 'The Daniels'.

An overstuffed odyssey about fighting against time and fighting against Juju Chewbacca. A 2 hour and 20 minutes long movie about the insignificance of our existence and a 2 hour and 20 minutes long movie about the significance of our existence. Something that shouts at you that ''Nothing Matters"", but inevitably makes you leave the theather thinking about how everything actually matters, you just don't have to overthink it.

There aren't enough words to describe Everything Everywhere All at Once and I feel like I want to dedicate my life to writting about this movie because from the moment I started to write this review I felt like I could never do this any justice.

Michelle Yeoh. A name I won't forget. This woman gave one of the most dazzling, profoundly delightful performances I've seen on the big screen. An Hanniball Lector-Anthony Hopkins type of performance. She carried so much with her performance, from being an asian immigrant woman in the United States working her ass off to reach the American Dream to a care-loving preocupied mother that at the end of the day just wants to be in harmony with those around her.

It has everything, an astounding, loveable cast, an emotional, strong and heartfelt soundtrack, one of the best works with editing and special effects I've seen in recent memory, a brilliant and a once in a lifetime writting and directing job from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and a redifined meaning of the multiverse that allows the audience to break any previous concept they might had about it.

Everything Everywhere All at Once had a budget of 25 million dollars and looks more refined and expensive than any of this big-budgeted movies flying around Hollywood. Cinema is to be made with love for the craft, passion and creativity and when made like that I feel like it can move worlds. And I know this might not mean a lot, but this surely moved mine.

Today I felt like I watched something I may never experience again and I just wished everyone could watch this too. This was indeed Everything! Everywhere! All at Once!",10
22 May 2022,Falls apart in the final,"If I'd only watched the first 2/3's of this movie I'd probably give it like an 8 or 9.

The final 1/3rd is shockingly bad, starting around we get some smarmy textual dialog spoken by some rocks(supposedly on a planet without people, but you can see a road in the distance...)

After that it just degenerates into random nonsense and over the top feel good garbage trying to cram its dull message down your throat.

I didn't even want to finish it by the end, it was so uninspired & boring.

Wish the movie had stuck the landing, but oh well.

16 April 2022,No words,"This movie was so perfect that it doesn't even warrant an analysis. And that's saying a lot coming from the biggest overthinker. It just left me with no words. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I'm still so confused - and it's not confusing. Figure that out.

Update: After a few days of contemplation about this film, I wanted to add my more developed thoughts. I am so glad that I gave this a few days to settle.

EEAAO is not a literal sci-fi, for those who may not understand. It is a metaphor for the meaning of existence, and it concludes that no one knows that meaning. Very simple. All the silliness and randomness is to open your mind to possibilities (much like hallucinogenic drugs).

So, whatever meaning that you extracted from watching this, that is unique to you. That is the hallmark of good art. Watching this movie will shift your perspective if you are open to it. In other words, if you have an open mind at all to begin with.

I have always considered myself to be very open minded, but came out realizing how I've become more closed over time. We tell ourselves that we understand the world, our purpose, our place. We become more comfortable and complacent over time. If you feel this way, be prepared to be rattled out of your shrinking box and wake up a little more.",9
11 March 2023,"Very interesting, creative movie.....","I didn't know what to expect and was totally impressed with this thought provoking, visually amazing movie. Michelle Yeoh is a wonderful actress and was fantastic, as was Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu. Yes the movie deserves some awards. However, when you compare it to some of the other shows that are up for awards (The Fabelmans, Tar, All Quiet on the Western Front in particular) there is no comparison...in my opinion. All of the high tech, sci-fi, overly sensationalized movies are becoming old. Whatever happened to the feel-good, beautiful movies? Yes, this movie had a message and did hit on our society today and I did appreciate that. But I would rather not feel so exhausted after watching a movie. Sorry....just my opinion.

16 July 2023,Beyond Tedious,"Watching this film felt like being in a time warp where time passed more slowly. By some considerable measure the longest 2 hr 19 min of my life. The slapstick comedy was cringeworthy and the plot a complete mess. If there was some underlying message it was completely lost on me. The fact this movie won awards is unbelievable. God alone knows what the competition must have been like in the same category, I shudder to think. Perhaps Chinese-American humour doesn't travel well. Whoever thought the was enough material for a 2 hr 19 min movie? There was barely enough to flesh out a 5 minute comedy skit.

13 April 2022,Misleading,"I would have given this 10, as its a beautiful art house style film. Its a piece of art and artists and masters will love it. BUT, for the fact all the advertising lead it to be more straightforward, I wasnt prepared nore anyone else in the theatre. I was tired about halfway through. Disappointed in the false advertising, as I didnt enjoy this as much as I would have if i had been able to emotionally prepare myself going in. This is the type of film you can watch maybe, maybe once a year or every two years. Its very good, but very draining, although not in a bad way is you are lrepared. Such as qith Amadeus.

11 May 2022,Chaos but fascinating,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",9
11 March 2023,Much ado about little,"Using the term ""overrated"" is to hop on the opposite bandwagon. One which says this is ""the worst film ever"". Not true. However, there is a strange amount of hype and bias behind a film that does very little, other than showcase some talented actors.

To put this in perspective, EEAAO recently surpassed Lord of the Rings: Return of the King for the most awarded movie ever. This is absurd on a level that is hard to put into words. Regardless of it you are a fan of LOTR, what it accomplished on screen may never be surpassed. It took a beloved book and created a movie that is equally if not more beloved and a legion of followers that spans generations. It was a film that is beautiful in every way. EEAAO is not that by any measure.

Is it unique? Yes, but to a fault. It attempts to convey a message through absurdity. The filmography is praised, but it is nothing that hasn't been seen. It borrows from the ""multiverse"" crazy we see in every superhero movie over the past several years. This is not the Matrix, which shaped a genre.

Award based on merit. Don't award a film based on the domino effect of opinion and expectations. 6 is generous. 8/10 is bloated by a sea of ""10/10's"".

This isn't a bad movie, and for some they may love it. But, it is not an 8/10 and it is not an best picture caliber movie. Don't believe me? Scroll the IMDB top 250 and be reminded of the amazing films on the list that barely achieved 8/10 let alone an Oscar.",6
20 May 2022,SHORT ROUND!!!,"I'm only thirty minutes in, and just watched Ke Huy Quan beat down six security guards with a fanny pack full of rocks. This fight scene is better choreographed and presented than ANYTHING in the new Matrix film, while maintaining a comical edge that keeps the brutal concept fun. Quan sells it hard too. I had no idea he could move like that. I decided to give it a watch because Michelle Yeoh is awesome, but I didn't know I'd be getting a long overdue dose of Short Round. . . Lo Pan too. I don't care where this movie goes from here, the first thirty minutes have me convinced this is a 10/10. Perfect blend of cast and genius filmmaking. Highly enjoyable.

29 April 2022,It somehow lives up to it's title,"What can I even say about this movie. It does everything, goes everywhere, and it still feels grounded in it's deeply human story, exploring the strained relationship between a mother, her husband, and her daughter. Every character in it feels developed, and both the lead performances and the supporting performances are nothing less than superb.

Evelyn is an aging Chinese immigrant who has to deal with owning a dry cleaner that is being audited by the IRS, maintaining her relationship with her daughter and her husband, and taking care of her father. Her problems immediately escalate when another version of her husband from an alternate universe takes control of her husbands body and explains to her that she is the chosen version of herself to stop a great multiversal evil. She is then sent down a path where she sees the lives of alternate versions of her life and the roads not taken, and begins to understand the meaning of her own life and her choices.

This movie is absolutely beautiful. Extremely funny, fast paced, action packed, and emotionally bittersweet. This is a movie I could watch anytime, anywhere, over and over again.

Just awesome. 99/100.",10
26 February 2023,Absurdism well played out,"Might as well have been Nothing Nowhere Sporadically. If you can tune yourself to absurdism, this movie is a great watch. Michelle Yeoh Choo Kheng plays that role exceptionally well in that role in a way that is absurd, funny, and down to earth at the same time. The bagel, however, was way too absurd for me. The role of Joy Wang could have been better portrayed, while Ke Huy Quan gives a very decent supporting performance. The combination of multiple roles and capabilities of the main character, and the swift switch between those roles, sometimes with absurd overlaps, makes this a worthwhile watch even if absurdism doesn't interest you.

13 March 2023,Oscars is a literal joke and so is fake IMDb reviews,"Anyone with a rational mind and average intelligence would know what movies, specially the ones considered for awards, have some sort of substance to them. A movie that makes them appreciate the art of film making.

This pure abomination received Oscars for best movie. Undoubtedly, Oscars are rigged and should not even be considered a benchmark for quality movies.

If a movie goer can sit through 10mins of hideous nonsensical hogwash this movie throws at them, then unfortunately there has to be something wrong with them.

I would watch Crounching Tiger Hidden Dragon a 100th time instead of 10mins of this mind-mess.

25 April 2022,I will never look at hot dogs the same way...,"Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" (R - 2022 - Theater)

Genre: Sci-Fi/Time My Score: 8.9

Cast=10 Acting=7 Plot=9 Ending=10 Story=9 F/X=9 Pace=8 Tech=7 Time=10 Intense=10

A simple laundromat owner is swept up in an insane adventure, where she alone can save the multiverse by taking on the abilities from the other timelines she has lived.

""Every rejection, every disappointment has led you to this moment...don't let anything distract you from it."" You could watch this half a dozen times and still see something new...the thought put into this project was amazing! I love Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis did not disappoint. I for one can't wait to buy this on 4K when it comes out on video.",9
16 April 2022,One Word: FANTASTIC,"This has been one of the best movies so far, in my opinion, I have seen recently. Too bad it has not been marketed much, but it is definetely worth the time and money. The whole cast is superb and terrific and the story is original and blew me away. Please see it. You won't be sorry. Michelle Yeoh is fantasic in this film.

21 April 2023,"Trippy, confusing, mental, ridiculous but you have to see this film!","I never got to see this when it first came out and we know the buzz around this film after the Oscars. We have one hell of a film on our hands! This has to be one of the most imaginative movies thats been made in a very long time. Directors and writers creating something without any studio interference.

When you have the blockbuster of the second doctor strange come out at the beginning of 2022 and this at the end of 2022, the contrast is the same as the distance in time. One is awesome and one was disappointing. This was certainly the first.

This is able to introduce all the elements that Doc Strange 2 wasn't able to deliver on. We had a small glimpse of what Rami can do with was the directors flexing their creative muscles to create something ridiculous! So much of the movie i was stilling in awe of what was going on, there was nothing that i knew what was going on. It sent a twist into the multiverse that was just perfectly twisted.

The whole cast was prefect, there are people calling that Jamie Lee Curtis shouldnt have won the award but its the same as Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, small screen time massive impact on the story and that is safe to say here as well. The only thing better than that is Ke Huy Quan being awarded his oscar by Harrison Ford, an awesome and wholesome moment for all movie fans!

Theres wholes to this film for sure but i cannot deny i enjoyed every moment of it, just waiting for each change to truly understand this mental world that was created.",8
14 March 2023,So much more than I expected,"I went into this not expecting much. But this movie is so much more than I ever expected it to be and will go down on the list as one of very few movies that got me crying.

Amazingly entertaining with no fear of not taking itself too seriously and embracing the ridiculousness of life while dealing with ultimately very difficult topics.

As someone that struggled with a severe depressive episode Joys story felt terrifyingly familiar.

The movie is not for everyone as the absurd fantasy sci fi setting wont work for a lot of people and thats fine. Its amazingly unique in keeping its lightness, silliness while still giving the time and attention to very relevant and difficult topics.

I keep trying to find a way to review this without spoilers but all I cant really say is its a fun, action packed exploration of choosing life, choosing people, choosing your focus, choosing your fights, choosing your path, seeking meaning and understanding, and mindfullness at a time when you are constantly bombarded either by your own thoughts or people and media around you, clawing at your brain to give them attention.

Imo one of the best movies of its genre in a long time.",10
9 April 2022,This is a fun watch...,"All the choreographed fight scenes reminded me of another great film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" And just like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", this film didn't forget that at its' core, it's a love story.

It's extremely confusing at times but it's great fun to watch.

15 June 2023,My Dad just couldn't remember the title.,"I suppose they thought they were being impressive with their anything-goes, aesthetic.

It's all kind of fun. The humor is fresh, the story is actually engaging enough for you to meet them halfway with their internal mechanics and they do not waste the potential to give us a sense of perspective on how no matter how trapping our lives seem, we live in a cosmos where anything might be a possibly.

The first three minutes mislead me and for a while I thought that we were watching someone's fantasy or some kind of Family Guy style cut-away that was non-canonical. I was a little disappointed that the whole thing wasn't in Mandarin.

The plot element with the taxes was anxiety educing, man.

Deliberately goofy and kitsch and not above a joke about situationally necessary sodomy, this was an epic and poignant experience.",7
30 May 2022,Watch it before you die kinda movie,"Watching it for the second time, in theatres this time and it got slightly boring but still, it is one of the best ever made films with so many things to connect our lives with.

*here's my initial review: (and I still have the same opinion)*

This is the real multiverse of madness, an amazing roller coaster ride.

It is a full commercial, sci-fi, family/emotional drama, crime, thriller, fantasy, humor, love, life, ALL GENRES IN ONE üëå

The film is almost like a combination of these films:

Lucy in relation to the presentation of the evolution of human civilization,

Transcendence for the evolution of the mind,

Inception for jumping between universes like in dreams,

Avatar for connecting with other souls,

Matrix for gaining skills like martial arts, singing, etc, more as you practice it,

12B for the combinations of lives you could've lived,

Interstellar for daughter's love & also a black hole.

After watching this film, it feels like having had a satisfying full meal.

This film is easily one of the best films ever made in the entire film history.",10
25 November 2022,Much muchness,"Well, that was a lot. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering the title. That being said, it seems odd to critique a film for having too much going on when that's kind of the point, but I'm gonna do it anyway. There's a lot of fun, entertaining, and even emotionally resonant stuff going on, but there's also too much going on to allow the kind of focus on any one thing to have the kind of impact this could have had. Is it about mothers and daughters? Finding connection in the world? Finding meaning through other people? It's all of these things, but emotional resonance happens when attaching these ideas to characters and their stories in a specific way to actually let the ideas flow through them while giving us the emotional connection to the characters going through it, adding intellectual depth to something that pulls at the heart strings. Having roughly five different variations on the same idea compete for attention undermines them all.

Okay, enough complaining for now, because while I do think the film needed a good bit of cutting down, there's so much to enjoy.

Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) is the co-owner of a little laundry in Los Angeles with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). They have one daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), who has a girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel), a situation that they are trying to hide from Evelyn's father, Gong Gong (James Hong), visiting from Hong Kong. Evelyn's life is a mess. The laundry is failing and in massive tax problems. She has this propensity of picking up new hobbies and then filing the expenses as tax deductions. The strain of the whole situation has led Waymond to gathering the paperwork for a divorce that she's too busy to even notice. There are regrets that she has made the wrong choices in life to lead her to that moment.

They have an appointment with Deirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis), a tax auditor at the IRS building, but as they go up the elevator, Waymond suddenly removes his glasses, starts speaking differently and with more confidence, while scribbling out random instructions for her to follow (including putting her shoes on the wrong feet). Sitting there with the auditor figuring out the sad, pathetic story of their lives through their receipts, Evelyn figures that there's nothing to lose, so she tries it, and she's suddenly in something much, much larger than a tax audit of her laundry. Alpha Waymond, the form of her husband from an alternate universe, has reached out to her because she is the one version of Evelyn that will become powerful enough to defeat Jobu Tupaki, an incredibly powerful being that has been moving from universe to universe killing Evelyn's all along the way.

The painting of the portrait of Evelyn's life is wonderfully (and perhaps overly) detailed, providing us with a very clear picture of the miserable little life she leads. It becomes ironically funny when we find out that she is literally the most pathetic form of herself across the entire multiverse, failing at literally everything, which, in handwaving logic, means that she has the capacity to become the greatest version of Evelyn to face off against Jobu. Her discovery of the multiverse is both fun and frustrating. Fun because the rules established are so consciously absurd (doing something completely random and out of character slingshots your consciousness in the right direction of another version of yourself that you then tap into in order to gain some kind of skill that you don't already have like, say, the mastery of kung fu), but frustrating because there is a lot to explain. It's not just the rules, but also the central conflict which gets treated opaquely for a while until the movie just gives up and lets you know a couple of moments later.

Jobu Tupaki is another version of Joy from the Alpha universe where Evelyn was one of the great scientists and discovered how to communicate with other universes. She pushed Joy to the breaking point where she became able to jump between universes without the aid of technology like everyone else, and there's been a race to find the right Evelyn ever since. What Joy actually wants with Evelyn is never as clear as it should be, I think. What she wants overall, though, is just the logical application of nihilism: she wants to commit suicide. This gets manifested in another of the movie's intentional oddities, a cosmic everything bagel that will consume Jobu and erase her existence.

The second half of the film is Evelyn slowly growing in power and also becoming more like Jobu herself. There are a lot of fights as Alpha Waymond works with Evelyn to try and keep her safe. She ends up at war with herself, mostly manifested with her desire to lose herself in a reality where she is a big movie star, but it also happens to be a reality where she never left Hong Kong with Waymond. So much time is spent on this that one would imagine that this is the central conceit of the film, but the antagonist is a version of Joy. So, this is about her connecting with her family, right? I could buy that, but then there's Deirdre. A surprising amount of time in the lead up to the finale is about connecting with Deirdre, mostly in a universe where people have hot dog fingers (an idea alternatively funny and really gross) and connecting with her. So, it's about relationships being what's really worthwhile? That makes sense, but this is where we're getting really diffuse. Oh, and then there's the Ratatouille parody called Raccacoonie where Evelyn works in a hibachi grill with a great chef who's hiding a Raccoon under his toque. I mean, it's funny, but it just goes to show how overstuffed this film is.

Why does that matter if it's funny? That it's funny is what saves it from being a drag at all, and it's obvious that most audiences feel like that's enough. I just get frustrated when there's obviously a point and the film can't get to it. In fact, it throws everything out of focus when there is a point and the film intentionally obfuscates it. Does that make it a bad film? Not at all. The movie is so filled with attempts to entertain and an eagerness to as well, that I can only hold this narrative frustration against the film so much. Still, it's there.

So, I've complained enough. I really do like this film. It may be overlong and overstuffed, but it's fun from beginning to end. Its colorful, light, and energetic approach to its concept overcomes a lot, especially when combined with the quality action choreography. Both Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan's talents are on full display as they fight their way all around the large IRS building set. Quan's early fight with nothing but his fanny pack is a real highlight. It should also be noted that virtually the entirety of the film (I'd estimate about 90%) takes place on two sets (the laundry and the IRS building), while never feeling constrained. Finding new places to film within the sets while messing with lighting help really give the small-budgeted film a much larger sense of scale than expected.

Yeoh carries the entire film on her back, and she is the film's foundation. She gives Evelyn in every reality a sense of life from her lived-in exhaustion early through to her bewilderment at discovering the larger universe around her to even her take as herself at a film screening, she's imbues the whole film with emotional truth. Quan reveals himself to be far more than Short Round or Data several decades later, easily alternating between versions of Waymond, one weak and wounded the other eager, smart, and proactive. Hsu as Joy is solid, and it's always a joy to see James Hong, especially while decked out in a mech-suit made from office equipment.

It's really not hard to see why Daniel Kwan's and Daniel Scheinert's creation captured the imaginations of so many people. It is Joseph Campbell's basic hero journey given a crazy, unique skin. At its core, it tells the kind of hero myth we've been telling each other for millennia told well, with energy, and uniquely. That it's overlong and overstuffed doesn't seem to bother most people. It just bothers me a little bit is all.",7
22 March 2023,More of a nightmare than a piece of art...!!,"Worst movie I've ever watched, Oscar is lost in its own mess... I personally was always that kind of a person who believed that certain type of mindset, old generation, so called ""boomer"" traditions (I don't like that label though) and stuff, are not necessarily right but there is for sure a boundary there which human being is missing it for good as time passes on!

Art is now being mocked and ridiculed by new rising mindsets.

If screenwriters used to try hard to stack certain incidents in a story in a way to not only give audiences a great point and message; but also bring us the beauty and art of storytelling without tiring everyone and mocking their sanity; then nowadays, a new hidden Agenda is rising by ourselves to take meanings out of everything and say: well, a 4-year-old child's idea for a story with a little bit of adulthood kinky tastes, can be a masterpiece as well, cause why not(!!!) .... This is sad! This is literally too much... not even a comedy but just a Mockery!!

If we change all we'd experienced and all that we now call old, prejudicial, misogynistic, racist etc, etc, just in sake of Changing it for satisfaction of replacing it, then mankind's progression throughout history would be gone and pointless!!

If like we start to call two parallel lines on a piece of paper as ""Art"" then we have insulted and cheated on every single master artists throughout history who have spent all their lives to create beauty of ""Art"" by researching, studying and experimenting every single aspects of our world to get to that final point of mastery.

""Everything, Everywhere, All at once"" is more of a nightmare in this way than a piece of art which had brought the most insane childish and lame ideas that one could ever imagine on screen and more shockingly, won most Oscar awards!!!

I can literally say if one can make This and harvest all prizes, then if they give me enough money, I can write and direct a dreadful childish idea worst than anything you all could ever think about and to add a bit of reason just in case, give it some sort of ending message of ""leave your children alone, stop controlling them, accept their differences"" and as it seems, possibly for next Oscar, they'd give me all the rest prizes that Oscar 2023 gave to other projects (maybe unwillingly, seems like in their hearts they wanted to give them to ""Everything, Everywhere, All at once"", even animated feature(!!!), yeah, cause, why not? I guess the scenario is: Let's change how we perceive animations(!!!)...) and literally harvesting all with no single one remaining...

There were potentially better nominees in every single part that this movie won it... It's just terrifying to think about the future of the the Art of Cinema even for me who was always avoiding being fanatic...

Anyway, just don't waste your time on this, there are seriously real masterpieces out there which are getting ignored cause mankind is missing the point somewhere...",1
13 March 2023,Genius,"This movie is genius. The way, it's chaotic fast pace story line (rather a mosaic of nonsenses) forces you to listen and watch and through that touches your soul several way. A way to help you realize, the life is wonderful and you just have to exist and enjoy the world around you, find its beauty. Existensism vs nihilism, choices vs acceptance, fight vs kindness, regrets vs hope. The whole movie is both a chaotic bucket of metaphor and a single beautiful metaphor of life.

If you haven't watched it, do it as a roller caster: don't try to control, steer, analyze, predict or explain, just sink in and enjoy this piece of pure art.

13 March 2023,"Yes, we love it","Yeah, sometimes people understand the movie. Because you know, most of us are weird. That's why we give the movie a perfect rating. It is entirely relative to each of us, not you. üòò It is a very fun, action-packed, over the top rollercoaster. Sometimes it feels like a psychedelic journey, sometimes like feeling a scientific theory. But most importantly, it has heart. It reaches for the heart of the cold of this modern digital age in which many regard themselves as reflections of their devices. We are pulled apart, separated more than ever but stories like this help remind us of what's important beyond what we can't control.

31 October 2022,An interesting and artistic take on mental health.,"Jackie Chan?! I thought that more than a few times.

The concept of the different worlds colliding is interesting. The movie can feel slow at times and the story a bit convoluted. Everything is pretty random and most things won't make much sense. It's okay, it's meant to be fun and lighthearted.

The main thing to take is the message. The rest is just a fun play and visual artistic representation of mental health. The main one being kindness and how it affects our daily lives.

Overall an enjoyable movie that felt a bit long and cheesy in some areas. The acting was fun and many scenes were funny and well done.

28 May 2022,I'd give 11 stars if I could,"This is a post-modern film. Negative ratings are from people who prefer the standard formulas of what a good movie and taste is supposed to be. So have an open mind for the positive reviews and watch the movie to form your own opinion. The high ratings are for a reason, and not mere pretentiousness.

Every once in a while there comes a movie that hits me so hard I know half way through that it's going to be a lifelong favorite. I've never watched a movie that is equally deep, moving, and absolutely hysterical. I probably haven't laughed out loud so often at a movie for 10 years. The cast is top notch and the writing crisp and smart. Everyone needs to give this movie a chance.

11 October 2022,Yeoh Delivers on All Cylinders in a Confusing Cosmic Journey,"It's glorious to see the redoubtable Michelle Yeoh play so many facets of her considerable talents in one singular film in 2022, but directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known collectively as 'Daniels ') pile on the intense multiverses on Yeoh's put-upon character to such an excessive degree that the end result was more exhausting than fulfilling. Yeoh plays laundromat owner Evelyn Wang who is struggling with an IRS audit and a disaffected lesbian daughter. Ke Huy Quan and a heavily glammed down Jamie Lee Curtis lend spirited support, though Stephanie Hsu was the standout as Evelyn's frustrated daughter. It's worthwhile just to see Yeoh play such a fully dimensional star role with such panache.

21 April 2022,"Fresh take on the timeless ""alternate universe"" theme","This movie is a journey that takes us through the life of Evelyn, an overburdened, stressed-out middle aged mother, wife, and business owner that simply can't catch a break. Soon after the start of the movie, we are transported into various alternative universes in which she resides, all of which are created by the decisions previously made in her life. Essentially, the setting in this movie is similar to a choose-your-own-adventure book.

Evelyn is called upon by people in other parallel universes to defeat the villian, who is eventually identified as her own daughter. As Evelyn moves through various universes, she sees how her life might have turned out had different choices been made throughout the years and millennia. The movie is filled with irreverent humor that had some moviegoers belting out hearty guffaws! There are elements of the over-the-top type of martial arts scenes you might find in spoofs of kung fu movies. But at this movie's core, we find that it is a story about how you can choose to love the life you have and embrace it completely. As Evelyn is shown all of her different realities in the parallel universes, she still comes back to love the one she is currently living in with all of its problems and flaws.

The movie drags on just a bit long. Jamie Lee Curtis's role in this movie adds to the quirkiness. The visuals are presented as a sort of dream sequence at times and they provide constant stimulation.

It's definitely worth a watch and is truly a unique movie that incorporates a lot of common thematic elements.",7
13 June 2022,How Did This Happen?,"I went in to this thinking I would absolutely love it, and that it would save me from a bad film-going streak I seemed to be on. No such luck.

Who thought this gibbering, nonsensical pile of rubbish was a good idea? Its greatest sin, though, apart from its self-satisfied incoherence and gleeful, endlessly stupid cartoon violence, is that it takes its hyperactive, sugar-rushed, calorie-free content and sticks a sickly sweet, syrupy blob at its heart, pretending it has substance and that it's one of your five a day.

This was the equivalent of a migraine: The first half gave me a headache, the second made me want to vomit. I never walk out of a cinema, but during this film's seemingly interminable length I came so, so close so, so many times.

14 February 2023,"Astonishing!! This is not just a movie, it is a cinematic experience!","Oh, wow, where do I even begin with this movie? When have I ever seen a movie where every single scene surprised me, and almost every scene had some sort of shock factor. 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' is not just a movie; it is a cinematic experience!

Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) owns a Laundromat. She lives with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Qua) (who wants to divorce her), her Father, Gong Gong (James Hong) (who is very sick), and her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu) (who is in a lesbian relationship). On her way to tax inspector Deirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis - like you've never seen her before!), Evelyn's life is about to change. In the blink of an eye, her normal existence spins out of control and she finds herself in an alternate universe, being called upon to save the multiverse.

If you thought 'The Matrix' was complex and confusing, just wait until you see 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'. The difference with 'Everything...' lies in its presentation. This film is so incredibly unpredictable and every scene is absolutely magnificent! The stunt choreography is jaw-dropping. The visuals are mind-blowing. The costumes are amazing. The editing is inane!!! Editing this film to obtain the desired effect must have been an absolute nightmare. But it looks STUNNING on screen.

As Evelyn jumps through the multiverse - referred to as Verse Jump - she encounters characters out to eliminate her, and in the process she must protect those she loves. The fact she can't trust anyone - not even her own family - makes her task a daunting one, to say the least. The film's antagonist is Jobu Tupaki (who is Joy in another universe), who could destroy the entire multiverse with a black hole she created.

There honestly was not a single dull moment here. This film surprised me every step of the way. Never before have I seen a film with so much going on - non-stop - and entertained me every single second. There's some really funny humour here, and then also a dose of slapstick. But the presentation was so astonishing that the slapstick didn't bother me as it generally would. The funniest thing by far, was the fight scene with huge dildos, and the butt plugs!!!! Absolutely hilarious!! The 'talking rocks' scene was just as funny, but also thought-provoking.

I'll admit, I didn't understand everything here, but hell, from an entertainment perspective, I was so entertained that it didn't matter. I will no doubt be watching this again several times, and I'm sure it will make more sense with every repeat viewing. I was completely and utterly enthralled by 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'; I was glued to the screen for its entire running time.",8
17 April 2022,What a wild roller coaster ride!,"I entered the movie knowing nothing about the movie. I barely even knew the name! All I knew was that my buddy told me he heard good things about so we made plans to see it.

WOW!!!!! What a roller coaster ride! Some may criticize the plot as too chaotic but considering that chaos is a major theme for the movie, I find it most appropriate. I loved the creativity, the editing, the characters, the plot, and the philosophy at the core of the film.

It has the laughs, the action, the drama and weaves through emotions seamlessly.

10/10 GO WATCH THIS!!

10 April 2022,This movie will be a classic,"Its hilarious, euphoric, meaningful, etc. Words cant describe how amazingly beautiful this movie is. Go see it...NOW. Saw this a week ago, and it still resonates. This movie caught me off guard. I just thought it would be a bonkers ride (which it definitely was) but it was SO much more. The balance of humor, action, exploration of family/generational dynamics and heartfelt message was astounding. As great as I found it, I know it won't be everyones cup of tea but I also can't help but recommend it to everyone.

22 October 2022,Strange but Amazing,"Seriously one of the strangest movies that I've ever watched and yet it had me in tears by the end of the second act where the meaning of the entire movie is revealed. This movie is like if you took the Matrix, Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and mixed them all together to create a quirky thought-provoking film that has you cheering for Michelle Yeoh (CTHD) and Ke Huy Quan (of Goonies fame) if each of the multiverses in which they exist. Is it for everyone...probably not. Could have easily seen Awkwafina in Stephanie Hay's role but the latter did a great job as the daughter. But, I won't be surprised to see Yeoh, Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis (in a role so far removed that she is largely unrecognizable) receive Oscar nominations come awards time. Suspend your disbelief before watching and then sit back and enjoy the ride.

21 June 2022,A lot of hiccups here and there,"The directorship is not great at putting things, simply poor.

The actings were below average! Why they dropped standards?

The story has a lot of nonsense illogical here and there, very disappointing when they can easily be better.

I can only give 6.3/10 because the special effects just average, story too much hiccups, orientations poor, directorship poor, actings poor,......

Watch at home free is recomended!

11 April 2022,Masterpiece with grace,"This movie is in the top 3 for me this year.

Michelle Yeoh is impeccable and moves like the wind.

The script is a reflection of diamond minds.

The action scenes are finally bright, slow motion, graceful like a dance.

But most certainly: the action is meaningful.

They tell a story with every movement.

This movie is amazing work.

It has heart.

It has character development for 5 peeps at lest.

I highly recommended experiencing this movie.

I enjoyed it the 2nd time better.

So many details and nuances..",10
7 June 2022,A good movie but not as said,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",7
19 March 2023,Fantastic!,"Wow this is a great movie. The cast is perfect and great acting performances by all. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers probably her best of her career. The story is original and can be complex at times. You really need to pay attention throughout to keep up with the evolving storyline. I can see some viewers not getting it and losing interest. Although, there is so much action throughout that this alone should keep viewers from straying. Cinematography is amazing and the stunt choreography is outstanding. You can tell there was a lot of thought and effort out into each scene. There are also funny, sarcastic moments all through the movie that flow well. I highly recommend this film and it gets a solid 8 for me.

16 March 2023,Enough material for 90 minutes,"I loved the casting, acting, and plot. CGI doesn't do a lot for me but I didn't mind as it was necessary to advance the story (for once). But 139 minutes? It was already repetitive after an hour or so. One could argue that ""everything and everywhere"" takes time, or that it should take time--even at the expense of clarity and originality--but either way it shouldn't feel like an eternity. All the martial arts and gags were funny somehow even though fairly unoriginal. Nevertheless, I couldn't help but feel the directors lost control of the pacing and rate of revelation--which was glacial. It also felt like the editors were paid by the screen-minute rather than for doing their job, which is to yell at directors and be brutal for the good of the finished product.

It deserves a 6 for the good stuff, not a 1 for the idiots who kept saying they didn't understand what was going on. It wasn't rocket science, just way too long.

22 July 2023,Nothing Nowhere none at any time,"I've watched my share of boring, uninteresting movies. However, it is unusual to come across a movie that is as painful to watch as this one. This movie is literally painful to watch as it gave me a pounding headache only after 30 minutes or so. I had to take two Tylenol Extra Strength tablets after watching (seriously).

I am a first-generation Asian American who raised a teenage girl, so I should be able to comprehend the protagonist's mind better than most. Yet, I could not sympathize with any single moment of the movie. I repeat NOT A SINGLE MOMENT.

As the title of this movie indicates, a lot of things happen on the screen. Yet, not a single moment was meaningful or had any depth. Everything happening on the screen was a series of absolute randomness without any meaning whatsoever. They were simply an excuse of flashing 2nd-rated CGI. The endless repetition of the same random craziness led to unbearable boredom and headache, and ultimately drove me crazy. You would have more fun watching a hamster turning a wheel as it will at least put a smile on your face.

This movie is one of the biggest Hollywood hypes I've ever had a displeasure of suffering from. No ordinary human being should be able to enjoy this movie, so I suspect that the hype was driven by all the mindless ""free"" thinkers who were brainwashed by the critics and influencers bribed by the studio. It is not surprising as we are living in an era in which Kim Kardasian is revered by the crowd. Yet, it is truly sad that people lost their own ability to think themselves and simply herded by someone else's opinion.

I sincerely hope that the average rating of this movie goes down as people come to senses.",1
4 May 2022,Great Movie! Must watch!,"Review Title says it all. Unique, New and a must watch.

Very funny. Very cinematic. Have not felt this way about a movie or show since squid game.

17 September 2022,"Wildly stunning, imaginative, and wonderful","I've been trying for days to find the words to describe this genre-defying movie. At its core, this is a film about family, acceptance, and learning to embrace the better parts of the here and now, despite the noise and pressures of the lives we live and the choices we have made. The vehicle Evelyn takes to her realization is a mind-shredding roller coaster of energy, sight, sound, and conflict, as she travels the many paths of lives she never led to the ultimate goal of happiness and contentment in the life she chose to lead. It is a ride that takes the audience places they could never have imagined they would go. I loved every minute of it.

This movie is packed with action, laughter, humility, love, silliness, crudeness, and depth, as the ""everything"" of Evelyn's multiverse existences join forces to guide her to a life-affirming understanding of what really matters. Quite simply, it is one of the most original, creative, and rewarding films I have seen this millennium. 10/10.

9 April 2022,Strangely beautiful,"I don't understand how they do it. This movie is absolutely absurd and over the top on one hand, yet simply beautiful on the other. The humor can be jackass-level crass, yet somehow the moment of reconciliation feels so cathartic that I literally had tears streaming down my face. I'm old and jaded, so it takes a lot to touch my cold, dark heart. Did I tell you I don't get it? The happy ending plot is fairly clich√©, almost formulaic even, but it works to the degree I didn't think possible for something with so much tropes. If it's food, it's like somebody takes stuff out of a gas station, then inexplicably mixed it up to create a Michelin starred meal. Inconceivable, and yes, it means what I think it means.

27 April 2022,"Entertaining and fun, but not much else for me personally.","Okay i decided to go see what's the hype around this film.

I wasn't super excited from trailers so i didn't really have expectations at all.

But where is this all hype coming from?

Is there some kinda Tiktok trend about this or something that i don't know because i don't have Tiktok?

Or maybe this just wasn't for me.

Yeah this is very fast paced, fun and entertaining action comedy.

Not probably my favorite genres.

Multiverse story that to be honest would've been much more exciting about ten years ago.

Some nice relationship drama between characters, but in the end that felt quite shallow.

Now this basically is like Marvel movie script that was just polished to be something little more unique.

There definitely is certain strangness in this that was fun.

But still suprisingly conventional story.

Great performances definitely.

Visually beautiful film.

Attention to details was really good thing in this definitely.

Very entertaining and fun movie, but sadly not much more for me personally.

I'm happy that some others liked it more.",7
5 March 2023,Epic Emotional Rollercoaster,"I heard good reviews about this. And usually when reviews that are this good, it is bound to be overhyped. But I gave it a try anyhow to see if it lives up to the hype. Not going to lie, it started off kind of messy, and I had a hard time following the story switching between the english and chinese language. The scenes in the first half of the movie appeared incoherent and it was hard to understand what was going on. But then I discovered that this incoherence was consistent, like some mathematical constant and came to realization that maybe I should not approach this movie with logic and I should not try so hard to understand it, but rather let the movie take you in for the ride and get into it for the sensation of it all and see where it goes. And oh my, how it delivered. I wasn't expecting such an epic emotional rollercoaster experience, even with all the crazy over the top things happening on screen, it blended very well together. It literally included everything, everywhere, all at once that you ever wanted in a movie. This was a masterpiece of a movie. Instant timeless classic, and topics touched upon that are very relevant for our times. This also shows you that representation matters! It gives us a whole range of new and interesting perspective and content we never knew we wanted! My compliments for the script writers and producers for giving us this gem of a movie and it certainly lived up to the hype and more!",10
25 May 2022,The chinese restaurant's Matrix,"Surprised that none of the comments I read (although I probably missed a lot), didnt compare it to the Matrix. Although certainly better alternative than messy and ugly Matrix 4, has pretty much the same introduction and location where the dimension travel begins, while the links to philosophy and religions are also present.

Michelle Yeoh has grown to be my favorite Asian actress and is certainly great here. The levels of imagination used and the ludicrous moments are outstanding.

However it feels that the budget was limited and that we watched an extended director's cut.

8 May 2022,I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years!,"Anyone who knows me knows how much I love Michelle Yeoh, who was my main draw for wanting to see this. An entire multiverse of Michelle Yeoh? Yes, please.

And this movie doesn't disappoint. It's funny, it's charming, and it has real heart. I saw it at the drive in with my roomie, my first outing in public since before the Bad Days of early 2020. Unfortunately, some of the subtitles were a little hard to read and blurry on the screen, which wasn't helped with the distance we were at, but despite only knowing a few words in Cantonese and Mandarin and with sorely outdated glasses I was still able to follow the gist with the careful sprinkling of English, body language and tone, when the captions were too blurry.

I have chronic pain and fatigue and managed to stay mostly motionless and comfortable in my seat because I was utterly engrossed in this ridiculous, wonderful film.

When it's released on digital next month, my roommate and I will be buying a copy immediately to rewatch.",9
9 September 2022,I hate star ratings,"It's very stylish, inventive and very well made, great cinematography, great cast Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis! But at about an hour in and i felt like it's just not quite doing it for me and i found myself wanting to do something else with my time. I'm really not sure why. I'd still rather see more movies like this get made other than yet more Marvel/DC character spin offs, the whole superhero concept is getting extremely tiresome to me. Maybe that's why i just couldn't quite get into this because it still felt a bit like a superhero movie at times. I'll give it another go soon and will probably feel embarrassed about this opinion and delete it. Maybe it's a case of it's not you it's me.

1 March 2023,What a great film!,"It is great to see a movie that steps outside of the standard boundaries of normal film.

This film can be a metaphor for so many things spiritual and what can represent meaning in our lives.

I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone who has not seen it and who also has an open mind.

I'm surprised not to see this on the top 250 movies on IMDb. Since I believe it's a passes, so many of the other titles on the list.

Hopefully we can see more from the producers and writers who have helped put this film together.

I really have nothing negative to say about this film hence why I have given it the score 10 out of 10.",10

13 March 2023,The best movie I've ever seen,"This movie changed the way I think about life and all of my relationships. I was completely absorbed from start to finish - it was absolutely charming, heartfelt, witty, fast-paced and genius. When I left the theater I felt like I was still immersed in the story. I thought about it nonstop for the rest of the week.

Anyone who has a bad thing to say about this movie clearly did not watch it with an open mind. It takes patience and you have to pay attention fully or you will miss major plot points. It's a movie that rewards you for paying attention.

I show it to everyone I know. Could not recommend this film more!!

29 May 2022,Incredible Composition,"This Film is able to unite slap stick with real deep philosophical topics and a really beautiful romantic family story. Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan are able to put really funny scenes in the film to get the perfect pacing between a heartwarming story and the sense of life from the point of view of very old Asian culture that ist still a great view on the things. If you are unsure wether you should go in this movie or not I can just tell you to definitely see that movie.

31 January 2023,Good but Overrated,"I really enjoyed the film, it had a great concept, I really liked Michelle and Ke performances but people out here are saying is a master piece of cinema. I think they are not used to watching many truly good films for them to put this movie in that spot, and come on 11 Oscar nominations? Comparing it to other movies that came out this year it really surprised me, personally I wouldn't have nominated it for anything, from my point of view you get an Oscar nomination because you are the best of the best and for me this movie falls short of that

It's a good entertaining movie about family but nothing more.

How they ever wrote it is beyond me, the editing is mind-boggling, the sound design is breathtaking, it's funny as hell, insane, and deeply touching. I've never seen anything like it... Like trying to describe The Matrix for the first time but crazier and more fun. I urge you to see it.

31 December 2022,Comedy Can Be Deal Breaker,"Tldr; Everything Everywhere All at Once is basically a Matrix Multiverse Comedy. The humor can be a deal breaker.

The amount of creativity this film is oozing with is amazing and it even has some great touching moments near the end relating to ""the everything bagel.""

But the deal breaker won't be the main villain's and main protagonist's acting (because they nailed it) or the well done cinematography. The deal breaker for most people, who decide this is a terrible, average, or GOAT film is the Comedy!

If you don't find yourself laughing at the constant humor throughout the film. Trust me, stop watching it, because it won't get better for you. You would be better off watching Matrix. Which is just as action packed and mind bending, just without the humor.

Other than that, as previously stated, everything else about it is perfect.",6
27 December 2022,In what universe is this film getting 10 stars?,"As a multiverse fan, this film is an embarrassment. A multiverse usually has some kind of design, some kind of logic that helps viewers enjoy the ride. Look at Dr. Strange and Loki. They both have simple rules that fans can follow. This film is just a chaotic mess. Perhaps it's no surprise that some of the commenters, who are raving about this nonsensical romp, are comparing it to the chaos in their own minds. The quick cuts and sudden universe changes come off as a gimmicky attempt to make you believe that something is actually happening. But, there is just no substitute for an actual plot. What a bore.

6 January 2023,The most brilliant family drama movie ever made,"This movie shouldn't work. The pure insanity this movie is at times should not make it any more than a cheesy action movie but it is so much more than that. The themes that it is able to extract through the pure stupidity and joy of it makes it so absolutely incredible to watch and view and the journey it took me on was one I will never forget.

The plot of this movie is so incredibly convoluted and so much is action is packed into this one film but the way the story progresses you truly never feel lost. This is absolutely insane to think about considering how this movie is shot and how quickly it moves but it however a plot that anyone can reflect on and examine for how incredible it is Plot:2/2

The ability for the actors in this film to shift from serious to funny roles is absolutely amazing but the most major props must go to Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu. There constant clashing weather as mother and daughter or as mortal enemies creates such a wonderful dynamic and one that everyone watching can feel drawn too. However, major props must also go to Ke Hyu Quan whose role as Waymond may be one of the best as well. His ability to quick witted and campy whiles also being one of the biggest drivers of the plot during the third act makes him as well every other minor character so incredible and crucial to the plot of the film.

Acting:2/2

This is the absolute craziest story I have ever seen and what I should have been throughout the entirety of the film was confused, grossed out, and bored and yet I was captivated for every minute of the film. This film gave so many incredible camera shots and artistry throughout the film that it just keeps you on the edge of your seat and brings you closer to these wonderful characters whose lives you feel so intwined with.

Storytelling:1.75/2

This film has creativity in spades. The simple family drama mother daughter story has been told so many times but this one did it in such a unique way that it can and will never be replicated again. The fact that someone even thought of a story like this and to tell it in this way makes this story so absolutely wonderful to digest Creativity:2/2

From the costumes to the music to the cinematography, every little minuet detail of this film bring it to the next level. You can tell that every decision was purposefully placed in order to make this movie the absolute best it can be and while there are so many moments when this movie shouldn't work but everything is done so particular that it ends up being perfection Other Factors:2/2

This movie should have never worked and yet it might be the greatest family drama trope ever told because everyone can relate to this film. Everyone can relate to asking why are we here and why this life and that's what makes it so wonderful. This movie shows our purpose for why we live the way we live and the over the top campiness only adds to the overall enjoyment.

Overall:9.75/10.",10
19 June 2022,Excellent,"In a time where often it starts to feel there are no more good movies being made, or even worse the world feels upside down, this movie gives hope in a very imaginative way. It's like Charlie Kauffman meets kick-ass.

Its artful, warm, cosy, funny and profound. And yes, the message is super cliche: ""love, not hate"" but packaged so well, in an action flick even, it feels new and fresh.

Not that the movie is completely perfect, it's not, but it doesn't matter, it's about taking something away from it that made it impactful for me and of course the beautiful arty approach.

The biggest thing I got from it is: it doesn't matter. People that make big or small things so important, are pursuing power and wealth etc. What does It all matter If you get sick, die or hurt good people along the way? All the rules people tell you to follow or feelings to feel are just not important. Just love each other for who they are. White, black, gay, it, them etc it doesn't matter if you don't hurt one another. We're all different and the same at once.

And yes, I also look at the woke community and the cancel culture they're building. Stop doing that! It's an unfriendly and inhuman approach. People are not out there to get you. One person doing a bad thing doesn't mean they're all bad. We are all victims of bad people. Talk about it, try to change it, but do it right. Don't become ""them"" that you hate so much.

I feel this movie targets everybody. Look in the mirror, try to be nicer. Why do so many people think there's more important things than that?

Thanks for this trippy and revealing experience. It's probably a movie I'll only watch once, but what an original experience it was.",8

1 May 2022,"Calculated, emotional mindf...","I went to see the movie because of the superb ratings. I guess this is another case of paid comments and critics. This movie does not deserve its current 8.8 rating - should be around 6. It has a simple good idea but tweaks it too long and its emoltional message its thrown at the audience's throat. Honestly, whoever is giving this a 10 rating, will you ever re-watch this? I doubt so...

28 January 2023,An absolute masterpiece,"This is an absolute incredible surprise, out of nowhere these directors brought us one of the most fun, colorful and ""alive"" movies in a long while.

I'm not exaggerating when I say this movie has the most heart and soul put in it out of pretty much everything I have seen.

The creativity, the color, the humor, the wholesome message throughout the movie and pretty much everything is done well here

Absolutely deserves all of the awards it is nominated for, this is a really one of a kind movie and perhaps one of my favorites ever

I really can't recommend this enough, an absolute joy to watch no matter on which screen.",9
25 May 2022,One of a kind,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",
21 June 2022,Too Hyped,"I felt this movie was more of an experience than just a movie, I did enjoy it especially the start but towards the end it lost me a little.

It's quite hard to explain the concept, I went in knowing absolutely nothing about the movie, I hadn't even seen a trailer. The fight scenes were beyond creative and fun, the drama in the second half of the movie kind of fell a little flat for me.

I would definitely recommend watching it, it's good but a lot of reviews saying it's the best movie of the year and even in years are a little much in my opinion BUT I can see why people do really like it, it's definitely refreshing to see this kind of movie in the cinemas. Have some fun with it, I did.

2 February 2023,"Everything I Wanted, All At Once","I haven't felt like this since watching Being John Malkovich over twenty years ago. What a fantastic and deep movie which explores existentialism, nihilism, and regret. However, it really is a story of a mother and spouse's relationship with her husband and daughter, particularly the latter.

Michelle Yeoh demonstrates a new side of an overstretched parent who also chooses not to see her daughter and is losing her. She is incredible in the first twenty minutes of giving off the day-to-day chaos energy the universe throws at her.

I'm sorry, but not surprised, to see so many negative reviews here. This is a purposefully chaotic, strange, and whiplash movie that so rarely graces the screen these days and is so refreshing to see Hollywood still has some originality. Kudos to the producers who green kit this, I can't imagine the gut wrenching of that decision. I hope it pays off in spades at the Academy Awards.",10
27 April 2022,"Well, i wanna praise it too, but...","I must say we dident really enjoyed watching this, and waited it to be over. We went after to eat burger, and was too tired even to talk with eachother. This movie is off course well directed and well everything, and it is brave, genius, etc etc. BUT, it's exhausting, pressing on the same button, same button chrlie kaufman pressed on in the 00's, telling the same jock, and the plot is 1/4 interesting, swallowed by extra enthusiasm. Well, i can see its the ""coolest"" kid in class, but what can i say, i dont really wanna play with him, he is trying too much.

Jaime lee curtis though- wowwww. And also the stones scene- veryyyy zen. Go watch it, BUT... its ok if you dont love this flavor.

3 April 2023,Made absolutely no sense to me,"I wish I had stopped watching it. I just didn't get it. It made no sense to me. I know it's meant to be a bit matrixy but at least that movie had a storyline I could follow. I would not recommend this movie and I do not understand how it won any awards never mind best picture! Maybe I'm not clever enough for this movie. I really wanted to like it. I like all the actors in it but like I said I could not follow the storyline. I got the whole if she does something really weird she could get to another dimension bit but other than that it just seemed like my 2 year old nephew made it up. Really weird.

30 May 2022,The best film of the year so far and one of the best movies ever.,"""Everything everywhere all at once"" is directed by ""Daniel Kwan"" and ""Daniel Scheinert"".

It stars Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Stephanie Hsu, Jamie Lee Curtis and James Hong.

This ""A24"" film follows a Chinese Immigrant called Evelyn is forced into a mission to stop the multiverse from crumbling. In doing so she must try and fix her relationships with her family.

I heard a lot about this film and I really wanted to see it. I can truly say not only is it the best film of 2022 but it's also one of the best movies I've ever seen.

The positives

This films message and story are incredibly well written. Every character has a well earned character arc. It's story is wacky but it works. The concept sounds ridiculous on paper but the script makes it work by explaining things clearly and making characters motivations clear and understandable. It also manages to take the audience and it's characters on an emotional journey that never gets dull. All the acting is excellent. The standout is of course ""Michelle Yeoh"" who deserves to win best actress at this moment in time. The action is amazing to look at. It's clever choreography and flashy editing make it more thrilling. The music fits the movies tone and atmosphere and also adds more thrill especially in the action scenes. The films cinematography is absolutely flawless. The lighting to the camerawork just make the film nice to look. There's plenty of long takes that just add that freshness to the film. Finally, the film is also incredibly funny. So many times me and the audience laughed out loud and I'm so happy that an original idea is making audiences come to the cinema more so that we can have a brilliant atmosphere.

The negatives

I can't find any big problems apart from tiny nitpicks and that's not affecting the rating.

Conclusion

""Everything everywhere all at once"" is an incredible piece of cinema. It's story and characters are fantastic, the acting is brilliant, the action is thrilling and edited brilliantly, the music adds more thrill to the film and the comedic moments hit nearly every time. This is now one of my all time favourite movies for a reason and I encourage anyone who can see it to watch it.

I'm going to give ""Everything everywhere all at once"" a:

10/10.",10
4 June 2022,What movies should be,"This film is a reminder of what can happen be when it's made not as a cash grab but a piece of art. I have never been so emotionally affected by a film before. Some people won't get it. But if you're burdened by a nihilistic thoughts and in search of some meaning in a depressing world, this film is a wonderful reminder of why we keep going.

4 February 2023,Hilarious parallel universe movie with a deep message & kung fu,"This is a unique sci-fi/action/comedy, with a captivating twist on the parallel universe theme. Incorporating several Kung Fu action scenes which also come with unusually comedic twists. The story is pretty deep but not in an overly pretentious way, and while there are a few brief moments where the writing crosses the line into cringe, for the most part the story is excellent. It's definitely helped by the superb acting by all of the main characters, and in fact the entire cast of this movie did a great job.

There's not really a single slip up from any actor in the entire movie. This may be, at least in part, due to the director being able to bring the best out of the actors. Cinematography is also great although it's clear to see the directors have experience in music videos so expect a little bit of that aesthetic at times.

If you've seen parallel universe movies before, you'll already know it's best to just go ahead and watch it instead of hearing about it described in a review.

This review was written using precisely-squirted ocean water on the blazing hot sand of a nudist beach. It was later transmitted to this universe for the sole purpose of appearing on this website.

Now back to the beach..",8
26 June 2022,Complicated Story,"The values brought by this movie is certainly holy and important to make life more vivid and harmonious. However It was not easy to focus to the plot of story. Too many roles, too complicated story, back and forth. Make a lot of time watching the movie distracted by the plot.

Good effort by all the team to produce this different kind of movie. However need to make it easier and ligth eri to be watched at the week end...

18 May 2022,Takes a while to explain itself but a fun ride of a film,"This is the sort of film you need to watch a few times to actually ""get it"" and soak in all the subtext missed from the first 2 times watching.

The film has more potential than it allows itself to explore. That which borders on deep Existential personal journey allows itself to be dosed with woke and soak with the basic premise moving from the genre of ""sci fi multiverse"" to ""teen emo angst"" story rather rapidly, and not in a subtle way.

Big fan of Michelle Yeoh since the 80's and definitely this one gets to showcase her multitude of acting scope. Worth watching more or less, but more for the Martial Arts display and less for the Rattatoie references. *

19 May 2022,Inception 3.0,"Profoundly cerebral. Deeply invocative. Insanely absurb. Brilliantly conceptual. Ridiculously and hilariously obscene. Spiritually evolved. Universally anchored in one message. Takes a real 3rd eye and all chakras fully spinning to absorb this movie and immerse into its cosmic plasma of awareness. Thank you for realigning what matters in my own reality happening currently - for real.

9 June 2022,Wanted 'Internal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'...,"...but got 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' instead. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film and most likely you'll enjoy it. But I guess it left me wanting more. It's funny and very clever but the storyline was lacking and there was only so many scenes with hot dogs for fingers that I could take before it felt very repetitive. It was in need of some heavy self editing and they could have knocked 30 minutes off the run time and not really have lost anything story wise. Is it the best film of the year, maybe. Is it my favorite film of the year, I hope not.

13 March 2023,With a hope dies enjoyment of fantasy,"Nothing in this movie seemed to entertain in the traditional sense - so it could be said that there was never a movie like this and probably wont again. Maybe a viewer was hoping for something solid to appear or a touch of reality but this just never happens. It certainly is a very weird way of entertaining someone. For a person who enjoys this genre maybe this is a great movie but there is a lot more to choose from so no probably give it a miss. Somehow reminiscent of a Jackie chan movie and has probably taken many cues from that genre with one of the protaginasts looking somehow related to him. There are some great martial arts type fighting scenes if thats your bag.

21 March 2023,Pointlessly Absurd But Watchable,"There is no doubt this films insanity is unbelievable weird, but in the same breath it's incredibly engrossing. Jumping in and out of parallel lives at insane speeds don't feel bad if you get lost. All the accolades it got will be divisive, but in my opnion it is deserved.

Avoiding tax evasion and managing a failing laundromat, Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) seems to be the chosen one to save existence. Travelling through multiverses coinciding with lives she may have led.

Screenplay and Direction is quite original and held up by a stellar cast, all of which won their oscars and deservedly so. Your expectations may or may not be high, however it will either capture your attention or have you pulling hairs.

21 May 2022,1/10 because of your stupid reasons and not for the movie??,"If you rate a movie because you're too dumb to understand it or are confused about it. Go watch a movie explanation/analysis from someone before coming here to give your 1/10. Come on, giving 1/10 because the movie is too long for you? Do you even know how to rate a movie?

With that said, I think this movie was very well made. It's a good twist to some of the multiverse ideas. The movie was full of all sorts of emotions. The acting allowed me empathize with the characters. It brought forth some underlying issues in our current society. Insane sequence. Well choreographed ""fights"". Support characters in the movie dramatically enhanced the story and it wasn't just about the main character. Many of considered confusing ideas in the movie are also explained well in the movie.

20 September 2022,In this movie lies laws of life,"Everything Everywhere All at Once, lives up to it's title of everything being everywhere all at once.

This is a busy movie with large to little detail that could be easily missed, so I recommend watching it when you're well awake and have time.

Now I truly believe this movie will be a hit or miss based on the type of person you are, your beliefs and perspectives. But I will say that if you watch it once in your current mind and come out hating it or confused by it, ask yourself.. have you ever wanted to be more than one thing but felt you couldn't? Were you ever sad and felt that misery had to be the way forever? Do you ever feel stuck in your reality? That things can't be different? If you answered yes to any of these, this movie is for you. And if you don't get it, go back and watch it again, this time try and apply it to your current situations in life. I did, and it enlightened me greatly.

I watched this at a pivotal time in my life/former relationship and while stuck in the thought process of hating labels and ""why can't something be more than one thing?"". I believe because of that and who I am, this movie hit home...real hard. I laughed, cried and got confused even. But at the end it was like the movie spoke in code that I well understood. Me and my now-ex watched it while struggling to figure out what our relationship was now that I wanted one thing and he wanted another, we couldn't find middle ground and were caught up with labels, expectations, feelings and the worlds reasonings. This movie alone answered our muddled questions.

This movie is like art at the museum. You don't always get it at first, sometimes you have to walk around it and catch it at different angles in order to have something click. I would say it's even a movie that has a time and a place in which you should watch it, for you to understand. My life was calling for this movie and was aligned with it when I viewed it. Therefore it spoke volumes. I hope it does and did the same for you.

Everything Everywhere All at Once acts like a true therapy session and life lesson if you dig deep enough, let go and let it. There's no saying what lesson to be learned for you personally, it all depends on you. But it won't leave you empty handed, and if you feel it's left you so? Search for the message because I'm telling you it's there.

The acting was superb as well as the animation and out-the box creativity. My soul needed this movie.",10
29 October 2022,Everything Electric & Smooth,"I would give it a 10 but rewatchability is difficult. Everything is set up as a ""new shock"" moment.

Michelle Yeoh plays a smooth, level headed leader in otherwise a totally electric family, with many electric things happening (story related). It's very watchable, real, and has a natural dramatic contrast so never boring.

Easy to watch, acting is real, but many scenes are soley electric aggression after a while and it's Michelle's characters role to untangle them.

The movie as a whole needed more structure and break moments, and a simpler ending. Too long was spent on emotionally strong scenes that weren't resolved properly (characters never really getting what they want, or agree'ing to compromise). Many scenes ended with Nihilism and/or revisited multiple times.

Wildly better than any movie made in the last five years.",9
4 July 2023,It's a lot,"I went into it with an open mind. Let's start with the positive: I liked the actors and they gave good performances. I also liked the fight scenes and the message. However, it was nonsensical, absurd and bizarre. I felt lost and nearly gave up watching it because about an hour in, the silliness and jumping around just became too much, and I really didn't see the point of it; still don't. By the end, I was disappointed, mentally exhausted and relieved once it was over. My husband believes that was the point-for us to go along for the crazy ride with the lead character (Evelyn/Michelle Yeoh) to feel what she felt. I guess.

11 February 2023,Unlike any movie you've ever seen,"Phenomenal. The only word I have to describe it. This movie is funny, sad, empathetic, brilliant and unlike anything I've ever seen. I can't remember the last movie I cried and laughed at so hard. And that remains true on my N-th re-watch of the movie. I continuously notice things I didn't see before.

I feel bad for those who can't see past the surface plot of this movie. This is not an action film, or a martial arts film!! Those who give it a low score are clearly missing the META points of the movie. Yes, it can be cartoon-ish, but that is not the point of the movie. If you've seen anything by Daniels, like Swiss Army Man, you would know that.

7 June 2022,"Crazy, wacky, and fun.","I want to say that Everything Everywhere All at Once is completely unexpected, but if you saw the trailer for this film or watched Swiss Army Man (the previous effort from this creative team,) you kind of go in expecting things to be extreme and odd. The film is delightfully off-the-wall once the action gets started, and I was ready for anything. What I can say completely surprised me about this film is that it made me laugh more than I have in a theater in a long time. When sitting in a theater with a dozen other people who clearly weren't getting the same enjoyment out of the film, I felt no guilt whatsoever when I was all the only one laughing like a fool at so many of the crazy moments. I know humor is extremely subjective, and there were a few things that some might find offensive instead of funny, but I was tickled by it repeatedly. I also think they abandoned some logic in order to embrace the insanity. Discussing logic might seem like a fool's errand in a movie like this, but there is still an internal logic established that should be followed, and I'm not sure that was always the case here.

The cast was remarkable in Everything Everywhere All at Once, particularly since they are all playing so many different versions of the same people. I struggle to think of anyone who could have done as much with the lead performance as Michelle Yeoh did. She is brilliant and crushes every insane thing she's asked to do. It was fun to see Ke Huy Quan doing his best Jackie Chan impersonation in a role that seems like it was clearly written for the latter actor. I haven't seen Quan in many films lately, so it was great to see him crushing it here, and holding his own. This was the first time I've seen Stephanie Hsu, but she did a great job playing the daughter, who becomes a vital character in the plot. Jamie Lee Curtis was almost unrecognizable, which worked great for me because I had no idea she was in the film, so I got the slow recognition as I started to register I knew that actress. I will say, one of the coolest things about the film is that there were so many powerful women driving the story, although that's diminished slightly because it still required the man to fix things.

I think part of the reason Everything Everywhere All at Once is being highly praised is the way it tackles some heavier topics despite the insane premise. I wanted to be overwhelmed with the way they delved into the complexity of the relationships in the movie, but it never quite brought a tear to my eye. I feel like they undercut some of the emotions by handling it through such odd visuals and a number of weird worlds, so when they returned to normalcy it didn't click as much for me. Although it's possible I simply didn't like the way it was resolved at the end. There was a moment earlier in the film that totally worked for me because I connected with the lesson that the protagonist learned, but the conclusion didn't pack the same punch. I also wonder if the filmmakers (and most of the reviewers I've read) think the movie is far more profound than it is in reality. It's hard to say, as I've only seen the movie once, and there's certainly a lot of crazy stuff to digest. Perhaps on further viewings I'll get more from Everything Everywhere All at Once and rank it even higher.",7
10 June 2022,A tour de force of everything,"I won't offend the absolute work of art that this film is by trying to be a critic... I simply have nothing to say, other than PLEASE PLEASE watch it.

Such a breathtaking experience that deserves every accolade.

WOW.

Its an immigrant story that just goes of the rails in weirdness, get more and more weird as the movie goes on. While i like the weirdness that they tried, i didn't love it so i gave this movie an average score.

4 April 2023,Awful,"I see the excellent reviews here and wonder if we were watching the same movie. I stuck it for an hour thinking I may get an explanation of what is going on. Nope, just more drivel and people doing preposterous things. How this was even nominated let alone win so many awards is completely beyond my comprehension. Who did they bribe to get nominated? Did they break into where the votes are stored and steal them all and replace them? I can't see why it would get some many votes otherwise. No disrespect to the actors involved, I'm sure they are excellent at their craft. I like quirky and I've watched some crappy movies in my time but I think this has to top the list. Now it's going to ask me if there are spoilers, can I answer yes, the whole movie!!!

2 August 2022,This is a spectacular movie,"It has been a very long time since a new movie has become one of my most favourite movies of all time. I do not want to forget this one in a hurry. A glorious, multi universe explosion of chaos, that was also absurdly beautiful.

I do however think you need to be on par to watch and connect with this. It's not something to sit and watch passively - you need to be with it, which for some movie heads won't play in it's favour, in particular for distractible types.

Difficult to point out anything wrong with this movie. If ever I'm somehow inconsolably down, for one reason or another, I might come here for a reminder of some really very valuable perspectives, life lessons maybe, as exclaimed here about our lives, and all aspects of success and failure, pros and cons in all respects, and ultimately the value to be attained from being right here right now, whatever now happens to be!

28 January 2023,powerful,"This is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen, but, ultimately, it is also one of the best. Writers and directors Kwan and Scheinert have created a very engaging and creative story and filmed it in a manner that is quite fascinating. It grabs you from the get go and never lets you go until the very satisfying ending. However, it only works successfully because of the outstanding performances of the entire cast. The Oscar nominations earned by newcomers Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan, and by veteran Michelle Yeoh and the grandest veteran of them all, Jamie Lee Curtis, are all well-deserved. Their faith and joy in the parts they play are evident and remarkable. Yeoh is just terrific and Curtis is a real scene stealing hoot here. The direction gets fast and furious as the rather complicated shenanigans play out, but ultimately, this is a beautiful and moving story about how the human spirit of friendship and family can always survive the worst obstacles that life throws at us. Brilliantly executed and acted by all involved. Certainly deserves its 11 Oscar nominations and its rank as the most Oscar nominated movie of 2022.",10
25 February 2023,One Beautiful Story,"All I knew About This Film was it was a multiverse film with ke huy quan's acting return however when I say this film is a much watch it is with ke huy quan and Michelle Yeoh Deserving The Oscar's for their Performances. This Film is Beautiful to watch with Family Drama Between James Hong- Grandfather Gong Gong, Father- ke huy quan, Mother- Michelle Yeoh, and daughter- Stephanie Hsu. This Film Also has funny moments with googly eyes and amazing action people into martial arts/ Hong Kong cinema need to watch.

10 May 2023,What Multiverse of Madness Should Have Been,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

6 July 2022,Tiw Everything everything all the time,"Today I watched Everything Everywhere All at Once and on a second watch it made me cry again

Let's bring up something here, I really didn't like the Daniels last movie I watched Swiss Army man. It was overly ""quirky"" and it's humor did not make me laugh very much at all, often making me cringe. I didn't see death of D. L. but I heard that movie is better than Swiss army Man, though that apparently is also divisive( I will get to it it's on my watchlist). To say the least, I was not expecting much here...

But after letting this digest, watching it a second time, I can say this is definitely a masterpiece of film making. The Daniels have made something that is truly special and is so insanely relatable. Like this speaks to me on such a deep level. But even with the deeper meanings of the film, the film making elements of this film are... just... so incredibly unique and impressive.

This movie is phenomenal, I love it even more on a second watch. Great cinematography, fantastic fight choreography, flawless acting. It's clear that there is heavy inspiration from the matrix, but inspiration does not stop this film from being completely it's own unique experience. This story is intelligent and interesting, the characters all feel so fleshed out and even though ridiculous... realistic too? It's so well done.

It's seriously hilarious and it never stops, it just gets more and more ridiculous and you would expect that to take away from the emotions in the film but it doesn't. The way these directors effortlessly blended tones is just a spectacle, you can go from crying, to laughing, to crying while laughing in a minutes time.

The best part of this film has to be the acting and action. Michelle Yeoh gave legitimately a career defining performance. She's gave it her all and it shows so much. Stephanie Hsu did incredibly too, she was very funny, and I loved the way she could change her personality on a dime. Ke Huy Quan was incredibly nimble and his performance was also stunning. Everyone did great. Everyone was super good at their action too, the way these people fight, it's so intense and I love the way the camera follows Certain fighting shots. Also the fights are very funny too, it's great.

There is not a single element of this film that is bad, but if there is anything that could be improved it could be some of the music choices, some don't feel as effective as others, but this doesn't mean that the music is bad. I really appreciated 95% of the choices here but as someone who's trying to be as critical as possible, this is my only real critique of this film.

Truly, this is an excellent piece of cinema that everyone should see. You'll learn something about yourself.

I originally gave this a high 9/10, I wasn't sure if I wanted to give this a 10, but on a second watch, knowing what it is, I am happy to bump this up. I love this movie, it's become one of my favorites for sure.

Low 10/10.",10
5 June 2022,Something different,"This was an interesting film, with very strong visual and sounds effects. Obviously many people loved it, but to me it was incredibly long and somewhat confusing. Felt like 30 minutes of good short film and 2 hours of a well-engineered video game.

27 November 2022,A confusing wonderful mess,"Yep. That sums up this movie. It is definitely polarizing. It's a movie that you either really like/love or hate. There is no middle ground. I'm only giving it a 7 because there were parts that were just ridiculous. And, I, a person that appreciates ridiculous in movies found it a bit much. Not going to say where because without those ridiculous scenes the movie would a guy it be as good, or more to the point, it would make far less sense. My suggestion just watch it. Even if you hate it, there is a strong message here. Honestly, the movie has a really straight fit and simple message: nothing matters but love. Yes, it is absolutely hokey, but it works.

15 April 2022,Words cannot describe what I watched but what I do know is it is a chaotic messy masterpiece!,"This movie had me laughing during multiple parts, had me sad in others, if you've ever watched an arthouse film this one by Daniels is truly a beautiful one! I wanted to see this for the past 3 months now, I finally got to see it last night because they opened it up to more theaters this is truly a crazy film. With an extremely unique way of addressing the multiverse and in a way I feel it pokes fun at marvels multiverse which is ironic when you see who the producers are (spoilers it's the Russo brothers the men behind Endgame. Which was the introduction to the multiverse in the MCU) as the film was about to end I had the question ""is that it?"" Not because it had a cliffhanger ending as a matter of fact it's ending feels like a closed book. But because I wanted to keep watching the reality jumping chaos.

One thing that should be noted is that everything that's happening on screen through every reality is happening at the same time as each other. Go see this film and you'll see what I mean. I truly loved this film and I will probably go see it 3-4 more times before it leaves my theater.

I should give a warning to some people who have troubles with seizures. This movie has a lot of flashing lights that may give you some trouble.",10

11 March 2023,Something is seriously wrong.... Academy!,"Absurdism randomness seemingly all fresh from what the world is making lately, but it doesn't mean it's amazing no matter what. EEAAO is a movie that is so hyped at Oscars probably to attract the viewers only.

When the fantastic lol takes over the fantastic life journey of keen observation and genuine interest in a motion picture, when money matters, sponsorship matters, movies like Women Talking gets ignored for acting and baseless actors like in EEAAO gets flooded. Time will come when Academy will be ashamed of such choices of North Eastern Asian obsession.

All the immature and cool people are gonna love this movie. So if you are one of them, go and enjoy with a popcorn. It's worth it all, and those who value something genuine, well y'all can go and tuck yourself for this is not your time.

18 May 2022,One hell of a multiversial ride,"I couldn't stop comparing this with The Matrix since both these movies share a common technology but in EEAaO there is a catch. I don't want to spoil these moments but these goofy elements are what makes this movie an original. There are so many inspiration and Easter eggs of other movies but still there's uniqueness in this movie. Everything in EEAaO is a masterpiece - Stunts are funny and serious at the same time , The cast have aced their roles , Editing deserves an Oscar and the Cinematography is a contender for Oscars ( Though I'm sure The Batman would win it ).

The themes of Nihilism and Existentialism are discussed in a scene consisting of rocks and if that scene doesn't convince you to watch this movie then I don't know what will.

1 June 2022,An Adventure of Imagination,"The crux of it boils down to ""Choose the Present"" and ""Choose Love"". Explores existentialism in its essence and takes you to insane places only to stretch your imagination. Is a true homage to human creativity and it's made it into my top 5 films of all time.

9 May 2022,Masterpiece,"All great movies should do 3 things. They should entertain you, they should move you, and they should make you think.

Everything about this movie is entertaining. This movie has a plot and action sequences rivaling the biggest budget marvel films and some of the most creative fight sequences ever imagined. The plot and its subsequent action sequences and dialogue is so inspired and endlessly inventive. The filmmakers took the idea of a ""multiverse"" and used it to craft one of the most entertaining (and hilarious) stories to ever grace the big screen.

Everywhere you look, this film is thoughtfully written with profound human experiences, deep, relatable characters and strong moving moments. Throughout the flashes of multiverse madness we are shown such a gripping and powerful story about family and relationships that is so brilliantly acted by a cast that is able to jump from one beat to another, broadcasting a spectrum of colorful emotions all while soaring through character arcs so wrought with emotion you may even find yourself tearing up.

All at once, this movie is profound. This movie is as deep and intelligent as it is bonkers and emotional. The centrifugal force pulling all of this together is the movie's philosophy. This is one of existential meaning; touching upon the surface of our daily interactions, all the way to our complex personal relationships, and even deeper down to our universal purpose and the meaning of every one of our actions. This movie is as much a dissertation of philosophy as it is anything else. There are so many movies and shows exploring the idea of ""the multiverse"" but by far this is the most critical and complex to date. It uses this theme to dive straight into a theory of everything, exploring the age old of why we are here.

I can't recommend this movie enough. It's so richly inspired and so delightfully fun, moving and thought provoking. This movie is Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.",10
5 November 2022,"Unlike anything you have seen before, it's Everywhere all at Once, a modern masterpiece - My Ultimate Review","Everything Everywhere All at Once is the second film written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, you really see how they have grown as filmmakers and storytellers from their previous feature film ""Swiss Army Man"". Everything Everywhere All at Once has been described by The New York Times as a ""swirl of genre anarchy"" and incorporates elements of comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts films, and animation. It's a unique movie and the interesting thing is how Kwan and Scheinert had researched the concept of the multiverse as far back as 2010, and they began penning the screenplay by 2016. So it's been like a passion project, in a way. Before watching this film, I thought it was supposed to be this action packed sci-fi film, but I was wrong. Everything Everywhere All at Once is actually a bittersweet domestic drama and a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filled ballad of mother-daughter love. Then it incorporates multiple other genres into the film, thus giving us some impressive sci-fi sequences but also some superb action sequences which are choreographed in such a great way. It's just 139 minutes of entertainment. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have created something special and worth watching.

An aging Chinese immigrant is swept up in an insane adventure, in which she alone can save the world by exploring other universes connecting with the lives she could have led.

Michelle Yeoh plays the lead role in such a brilliant way, showing her impressive acting range when she ultimately ends up portraying different versions of her character. The same would be said about Ke Huy Quan who plays her husband and Stephanie Hsu who plays her daughter, but Michelle Yeoh is terrific and her performance is one of the film's highlight. Meanwhile the supporting cast has names like Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong, and Jamie Lee Curtis.

The film explores the concepts of the meaning of life and nihilism, also themes of existentialism and Asian-American identity. Anne Anlin Cheng wrote in The Washington Post: ""It's not only that the multiverse acts as a metaphor for the immigrant Asian American experience, or a convenient parable for the dislocations and personality splits suffered by hyphenated (that is, ""Asian-American"") citizens. It also becomes a rather heady vehicle for confronting and negotiating Asian-pessimism"". The theme of meaning of life and the deep story regarding the relationship of mother and daughter and the marital themes was my favorite parts of the writing, well all the themes really were brilliant.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is a complex film that encompasses a variety of subjects, but it does justice to each of them with a superbly written script, spectacular performances, and plenty of bizarre humor that doesn't drag on too long to counter its bleak story. It's a film with a deep message that executes its themes perfectly, making you think and reflect about them. It's directed, edited and written with such brilliance. Acted perfectly. The humor might not be for everyone, sometimes it was too bizarre and extreme, but it works if you get immersed enough into the movie which was easy. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert has a strong imagination, the film wouldn't have been as good if it wasn't for just that, their imagination. Beneath the bizarre humor and over the top sequences lies a film worthy of everyone's attention, it's deep as it's extreme, it's a masterpiece that could have easily been a failure. But it became a box office hit (A24's highest-grossing film at the domestic box office) but also universally acclaimed by critics and audience.",10
7 April 2022,Good but Flawed,"I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. It was very original, had decent acting and interesting effects. It was also unnecessarily confusing, too long by about 40 minutes And from what I can figure out quite illogical in its use of multiverse theme. It also didn't help that the hardware they were using to zip around the Multiverse looked like it was from a 1980s science-fiction movie. Some of the fight scenes were cool, but had a lot of unnecessary slapstick comedy thrown in which really doesn't work for me and seemed very out of place. Worth a watch though.

26 April 2022,EVERYTHING SAYS IT ALL...!,"Michelle Yeoh is up & front & center in this unwieldy inter-dimensional comedy which finds a harried laundromat owner going through the motions as everything seems to be going wrong for her (she's being audited by an overzealous IRS rep, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, her hubby, Ke Huy Kuan, is about to file for divorce & her gay daughter, Stephanie Hsu, wants to show off her girlfriend to her family & possibly bigoted grandfather, James Hong). The pressure becomes so paramount Yeoh is visited by another Kuan from another universe who explains her heightened state may fracture time & space as she knows it. Fighting both physically & emotionally to keep it together soon runs the gamut of the film's run time (a bit too long for my taste but my viewing partner loved it) as the inventive directors, the Daniels (Swiss Army Man), throw everything & the kitchen sink at the screen (love the parody of Wong Kar Wei films) to bring this phantasmagoria to existence w/all the actors game for the lunacy (especially Kuan who pretty much retired from acting but came back for this) w/a nice showcase for Yeoh who steps up to the challenge to steer a picture by herself. Also starring Jenny Slate as a customer (identified as Big Nose, sheesh!) & Glee alum Harry Shum as a chef.",7
15 May 2022,Yin and Yang,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

Grade: A.",9
15 September 2022,Too easy to get lost in,"It's a good movie. It just tries to do too much and it's so easy to get lost during it. There are so many things happening all the time that I couldn't really relate to or identify with any scene or relationship. I loved the beginning and I liked the end, everything in-between felt too complicated for me to fully enjoy.

I liked the exploration of the protagonist's relationship with her daughter, I thought it was an interesting take and the cinematography and CGI are incredible.

It just felt too long and repetitive sometimes.

Overall it's a cool and creative idea but that doesn't necessarily make it an interesting movie all the time.

4 May 2022,BEAUTIFUL AND MIND AWAKENING,"This movie has moved me so much, their so many hidden details and messages one can easily miss during the duration of this movie becsause of all the crazy stuff going on. The message the movie this gives is amazing. To not care about the little things and to accept eachother for who we are, so many realities and ways life can go from just one single choice you make. Whether or not they are good everything in life is infulenced by the choices we make. WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH A OPEN MIND.

23 March 2023,A simple story at its heart,"The real beauty of this film is the simple and relatable familial story at the heart of it. Strip away all of the effects, the confusion and the distractions - it's a story about a family struggling to find their happy place. It's something that resonates, and once this becomes clear the film starts to make a bit of sense.

The challenge of this film is that you need avoid pausing every 10 minutes or so to figure out what the heck is going on. It starts with a family's trip to the tax office preparing for an audit and then 'boom' the pace changes, it's fast and frenetic, much like the dialogue - and it's hard to keep up. It's worth noting that you're not familiar with this genre of film, then you maybe won't like it, but if you do, you'll simply immerse yourself and go with it.

The struggle with the film is that for a large portion of the film it doesn't really go anywhere - fight scene after fight scene. The set up is good and the finale is great - it just takes some time to get there. The film tries to be serious, thought-provoking, clever, silly and funny all at once. Personally, I think the multi-verse aspect is overdone and parts of the film feel plain stupid.

Above all, this is a seriously original film and that has to be lauded - it just isn't that good. You'll be glad you've watched it but probably won't watch it again.",7
2 April 2023,Can I get my money back?,"Went to the cinema after the Oscar's to see the movie that won so many Oscar's. I didn't pay any attention to this movie before when it was at in the cinema last year. It came up again at the cinemas so I thought I give it a try. Boy was I wrong!!!! This movie was a total waste of time. Hollywood robbed my life from 2 hours and 19 minutes. Can I please get my money back ?!? Was the jury at the Academy of the Oscar on some drugs or did they actually see the movie? For me this is a big embarrassment really, they should be ashamed giving this movie any Oscar at all. Shame on you. I'm angry. Is there any refund of my money I spent on this rubbish?

It had the laugh out loud humor you would expect of anime and real subtle ones as well. As for the acting, it was sublime. It seems those who gave this movie a low star rating was because they set their expectations WAYYY too high or they could not go past the culture barrier. They will grow up someday...or not. Go watch this movie and give it a real try.

26 June 2022,This is why films exist,"After what feels like eons of derivative films, sequels of old classics, and emotionless tat, we are thrown into a world where anything can happen, and does, but the characters are well developed, the concept unique, the action is innovative and the ending is satisfying (rather than a cop out). Lovely direction, acting, score. One moment I was crying, the next I was laughing.

It gave me hope for the film industry.

15 March 2023,"I get it, but I am 67.","Yes, I agree, it's a mess. It's hard to watch on so many levels. It makes your head hurt. You are confused. Who do you love and whom do you trust? You want to be in charge of your life, but are you really in charge?

This is a very chaotic film. It never gives you a darn break for almost all of it. Fascinating, but you want to stop watching.

I wanted to turn off, like 3 times. Everything everywhere part was un-centered and ridiculous. I kept with it. I kept watching as life delivered was indeed true.

(we) as a whole are a mess. Yes. I know you are in control. But are you really. Have you really sought out your life.

Can we deliver on a level to make things important stand out above trivial things that embrace us and capture our lives?

In summary, if you want to get down in the grit, watch it. Make things happen. This is what this story is about. Chaotic and resolution.

Outside that it was a bit weird and hard to follow sometimes. Crowd laughed and seemed to enjoy it. For me it was silly, weird, hard to follow sometimes, and Iover cooked on all the messages.

25 March 2023,There are infinite metaverses lurking in your brain. Absolute genious. Lots and lots of laughs. Inmense Michelle Yeoh,"Evelyn Wang is exhausted from facing the endless responsibilities of running the family business, unable to accept her daughter's sexuality, hurt by the estranged relationship with her father and the demands that he has always placed on her, bored with a husband whom she considers a nullity and an obligation, depressed for feeling like a failure and bitter for considering that her life is not what it should, could and deserved to have been.

A party in honor of her father, an unexpected visit from her daughter's girlfriend, a divorce lawsuit from her husband and a tax audit that threatens to close the family business precipitate the crisis.

But to her aid come the infinite metaverses that have always existed lurking in her brain.

Although an intriguing and teasing first shot shows several successive reflections in a mirror, and a misterious shot of the security camera (not seen by Evelyn), I think we can't go wrong, it all comes from Evelyn's mind. As she herself says: everything she thinks, even the craziest, comes to life (Ratatouille becomes Raccacoonie, and in some corner of her mind a glimmer of hope can make her think of a planet without life but where the stones have gogle eyes). In any case, these metaverses will serve in the film to reflect, develop, comment on Evelyn's problem, and to herself to face her temptations and her fears, and take her own decisions.

Great joke about the fashion of metaverses and other pseudoscientific nonsense, unprecedented display of inventiveness that is not afraid of bad taste or the most wildly unjustifiable ideas, superb display of technical expertise brilliantly applied to the story, glorious tribute to the talent of the great Michelle Yeoh and the most hilarious movie that has been seen in many, many years, Everything everywhere all at once triumphs on all fronts. Gloriously chaotic by definition, it invents rules to forget them after a few minutes, because it is a living organism that is constantly changing and evolving like Evelyn's own mind. The film relishes in being absolutely unexpected and unpredictable.

The cast is magnificent in its entirety, brilliant Stephanie Hsu, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ke Hui Kwan, but above all Michelle Yeoh stands out in the role of a lifetime, a tribute to an extraordinary career, which shows us that her abilities are so extraordinary like that of its complex film character.

There are many cinematographic references, of course to martial arts cinema and its star-system, but there is certainly a lot of Fellini (Otto e mezzo, Giulietta degli spiriti), Sirk's melodramas, and winks to Bergman (Persona), Bu√±uel (L'age d'or) and Keaton (Sherlock Jr.)

A masterpiece, to which you can only put the but (not so important given the geniality of what it offers us) of lengthening its resolution in a somewhat unnecessary way, and putting its structure at risk with too many successive climaxes. But it's unfair to criticise a film when it dares to say so many things in such an imaginative way.",9
26 March 2023,"Good, absurd, funny","Normally I like for a plot to make sense, and I understand the complaints from those who think it doesn't, but over the years I've tried to be a little more patient with movies and I found this one interesting even though it wasn't wrapped up nicely with a bow. Great cinematography, acting, production,. You can tell that this movie had a nice budget.

I don't care anything about Oscars but the fact that this got 11 seems a bit much. When Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane were out there were probably only five categories for Oscars and now there are probably 200. Does best key grip person get an Oscar? Probably. So the 11 will be broken as they continue to roll out more categories but nevertheless it is a good movie.

ABOUT MY REVIEWS:

I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.

My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",7
25 March 2023,Unconventional & Creative,"If you want a film that holds your hands and guides you through the story the EEAAO is not the film for you. If you want to be spoon-fed explanations for what is going on then EEAAO is not the film for you. If you struggle with assembling a IKEA cabinet, the EEAAO is certainly not for you. On the other hand, if you like daring, imaginative an original story-telling, the EEAAO is absolutely worth checking out.

The cast are fantastic and the concepts are very well explained. The effects are insane given the size of the budget of the film. The editing is top notch and it is laugh out loud funny too.

28 May 2022,A uniquely fun and welcomed experience,"It's been over a week since I watched Everything Everywhere All at Once and my mind is still frazzled. Partly because of when I saw it and partly because of how it pulled off a unique multiverse experience that had a strong story, comedy, action, sci-fi and unreal editing/design. It's a film that I'll need to re watch.

It's also one of those film that required a lot of thought to think up and just as much work, if not more, to pull it off. Whilst it probably won't click for everybody, some parts are really over the top, it's worth experiencing at some point especially if you are looking for an action/sci-fi film outside of the MCU and DCEU. If Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness didn't work for you, check this out.

That's twice A24 has surprised me this year and their next film, MEN - a horror, is only a week away.

19 May 2022,"Sound and Fury, Signifying Everything Everywhere All at Once","I'd heard good things about this, but the fact of the matter is it's basically just any of the Matrix films jumbled up with some overused Spider-verse/ Dr Strange / Rick & Morty, etc. ""multiverse"" plot ideas that I've seen far too many times now to find innovative or get excited over.

I admire the filmmakers attempting something technically more challenging than the average flick but the end result is just a very shallow and boring film with no interesting characters to connect with or care about, and it felt to me just another one of those recent things made by people who've grown up almost exclusively on video games and so confuse unlocking game levels with storytelling. Because of this, no characters feel real or believable: everyone in it's just an NPC, and so their lives and life events have no weight or depth.

It's all sound and fury, signifying nothing, and I'm sorry to have to say I couldn't get all the way through it. But my own life's better for that.",3
17 April 2022,BRILLIANT,"I'm not going to get into symbolism or break down the themes of the movie in this review. All I have to say so that this movie has everything you could want. Great acting, directing, visuals, HILARIOUS comedy, beautiful drama, stellar action, fantastic fantasy, amazing commitment to quirky weirdness, original and captivating creativity, beauty in the benign. This film made me cry twice during the runtime and then it had me literally crying in the street about 10 minutes after I left the theatre from just reflecting and taking in what I just saw, I even cried while trying to have a sit down lunch with my partner and the beauty and emotions and themes from the movie were just so visceral that I couldn't keep in the tears. It's so beautiful and it takes you on such a ride and you feel every emotion. When nothing matters, you find out what truly matters.

Michelle Yeoh is someone I've always admired for her baddassery and talent, and here she is at her best and she shows that she is a versatile and incredible talented actress to the world that might not already know of her amazing abilities. This movie is special, and entertaining, beautiful, meaningful, and such a fun ride. I can't rave about it enough. Just go see it! Let it take you on this journey and you maybe you will also cry on the street and while trying to order lunch after the movie. I'm eating a 10/10 which I RARELY do! I usually save 10/10 for just my personal faves that I love. This is my new favorite and I don't know how or if it'll ever be topped.",10
28 January 2023,Beautiful,"Everything Everywhere All At Once. I'm a grown man and I cried through almost the whole movie. Maybe a little because their sad little struggling existence in the beginning looks a lot like one I've lived. A lot because the movie has so much authentic emotion and that it breaks and fills up your heart. A lot because it's so imaginative and joyous that it had a profound effect on me that I would just get so overwhelmed watching it I'd tear up. It's so original and on top of it so many Asian faces. It means so much that there's so much Asian culture and experience in such a big movie, but that Asian-ness is no more consequential than if they were Irish. It's a part of who they are, but it's not all they are. It makes us all the more connected despite our differences. But the last thing is the idea that we all have so much potential. So many possibilities. And maybe we always have, possibilities. Shortround, all these years later is BACK. In real life. So that message rings true. And he is wonderful in the movie by the way. After all this time he found his potential again. Everyone does personal best work in this film, especially Michelle Yeoh. One of the great film performances. Ever. The effects and editing weren't more of the same thing we've seen and gotten spoiled by seeing often. All that production and detail instead applied to sights we've never seen in places you'd least expect it. It might not have the same effect and affect on everyone, but I thought it was just beautiful. There's so much humor and originality and unbridled imagination and the ability to take ideas, that like the multiverse has been done many times, but make them feel fresh and new. We're lucky if we have people to walk through the world with, and even at our worst we can remember there's still something to love in us all. How beautiful is that?",10
13 April 2023,A beautifully made movie about love,"Definitely one of the most well crafted movies I've ever seen!

A movie that requires your 100% attention at all times as it's jumping between two languages and although it's themes are simple and very human in nature the way that the film makers chose to communicate them are very complex and hard to understand, which in my opinion makes this movie a cinematic masterpiece. Furthermore, the acting was impeccable and the directing and cinematography are diverse and interesting, having been inspired by numerous Asian and European films !!!!

The film might be concealing it self as action with numerous amazingly filmed fight scenes and themes as a multiversal threat but at its core it's a movie about love and the complexity of human relationships. The relationship between a parent and their child, between partners, in laws and most importantly the one one has with himself!

31 July 2022,Sorry. What did you say?,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",9
14 April 2022,Bananas,"Bananas is the word that comes to mind if I had to describe EEAAO in one word.

This film gets all its 7 stars for acting, originality, and frequent bouts of bonkers hilarity. I haven't cried laughing in a long time and kudos for having a scene good enough to get that out of me. It was the score in that scene that actually put it over the top for me.

That's a good transition. ""Over the top"" is the best way to describe the 3 missing stars. It tried to take itself way too seriously at some points for something so zany overall. In my opinion if the heartfelt scenes and the moral messages could have been less heavy handed, I think it would have had a better impact.

I hate to say I found myself bored at times and the run time could have been shortened. It tried to tie up literally every single minute storyline and character, except for some reason with Big Nose, who should have had a bigger role in the plot I think.

Overall it was a really fun experience and I'm glad it exists in this universe.",7
4 May 2022,Bizarre and Amazing All At Once,"What an absolutely thrilling ride!

Everything Everywhere All At Once is absolutely bizarre, hilarious but also incorporates a really touching underlying story.

This movie is getting a lot of buzz, and WOW is it justified! You've got the stellar acting of Michelle Yeoh accompanied by Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis. A perfectly twisted story that morphs into a very relatable ending thanks to writer/director duo Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.

Although it's hard to describe EEAAO without spoiling some fun scenes, I definitely recommend this as a great watch!

22 April 2022,A Wild Ride That Is Sure To Entertain Everyone,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is an absurd adventure, which somehow teeters on the line between Asian arthouse, and accessible adventure film. Daniels manage to coordinate action, suspense, and comedy in such a way that flows flawlessly, and allows each element to compliment one another. Every decision made is purposeful, and every technical element is strong. Michelle Yeoh puts up what is perhaps her best performance to date, and is supported by a slew of spectacular co-stars, such as Ke Hua Quan and, Jamie Lee Curtis. This is a film best analyzed after a second watch due to its relentless action, and chaotic atmosphere. The set design, hair and makeup, visual effects, and cinematography will undoubtedly warrant this film consideration come Oscar season. Everything Everywhere All At Once is a film that will be enjoyed by everyone, as it's artistic elements are sure to intrigue any cinephile or film student, and it's accessibility is sure to entertain any average movie goer. Daniels have proven their range, and genuine talent with this film, and have managed to make something unforgettable on what is only their sophomore effort as a duo.

8 April 2022,Yes,"Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)

13 July 2022,Not sure if I liked it or hated it,"This was undoubtedly fun to watch. So many vibrant and interesting scenes. Great concepts, great acting, and some of the best fight scenes i've ever seen. However, this movie was almost too fun, it made the dialogue scenes boring and out of place. I would probably love this movie if I were 10-12, but I definitely saw some scenes that were out of place and did not add much to the story. Again, great concept and a super fun watch, but was a bit over the top for my liking.

12 March 2023,Not sure what all the fuss is about.,"Edit: Seven Oscars for this film just show how desperate Hollywood has become and how low the bar has sunk. Good luck to the winners but this is just style over any real substance. There were so many other worthier potential winners. Shame on the Academy.

There are a few moments in this film where someting profound or original is said but that's about it. I don't get why everyone is tipping Yeoh or Curtis for Oscars as the acting in general is frenetic, shouty and average and overshadowed by the special effects. The storyline about multiverses is an interesting concept but the execution of this is confused and poorly executed. I'm willing to bet that a lot of people 'like' this film because they don't want to be seen as missing the point. I'm guessing that the point is about making the most of your life decisions and realising that everyone has a tale to tell and bears the scars of living. At the end of it all is there any point to life or to this film. I've seen worse films but I was expecting more after all the hype.",3
11 April 2022,don't walk! RUN to the theater!,"Beautiful movie that takes a look at generational trauma through absurdity. This movie will make you feel like laughing one moment, and crying in another. Everything everywhere all at once reawakened my passion for cinema. A MUST watch !!!

18 May 2022,One of the most creative and original movies I have ever seen,"A movie about how nothing really matters, but paradoxically also about how every little thing is important.

Wow! What a rollercoaster ride of imagination, absurd comedy, deep philosophical questions, amazing visuals and a superb cast.

The movie can and will be a bit confusing with alle the jumps, but somehow it works really well, and doesn't distract from the overall storytelling.

Watch it! I can't guarantee that you'll love it, but you will be a weird and great story richer for it. This is movies and storytelling at its best.

7 December 2022,it's better than drugs jeremy!,"Every new film/series is just a reminder, that we've barely scratched the surface in the infinite possibilities of storytelling and who knows what great new film/series is coming next... to make us feel even more tiny in this vast world of cinema.

Been wanting to write a review for this since long ago but I couldn't really frame what I had to say for it up until now when I rewatched it today.

This film is as absurd as it can be in it's presentation, and that's a good thing. Filmmakers are afraid to tap into weird and absurd things nowadays because of the possible financial losses. Which makes this film feel really fresh in it's concept, it's storytelling, it's action, it's humour, everything is a result of peak imagination from the writer-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.

Michelle Yeoh. Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, James Hong. Jamie Lee Curtis, each and everyone in the cast is so good that there is not a single loose thread in the acting. They're all just perfect.

The story, phew. I can't really describe it to you but just to summarize, it's essentially a story about a mother who is a failure but doesn't want her daughter to be the same, but even if she's a failure, it doesn't matter because it does not change the fact that she is always gonna be her daughter and nothing in this vast multiverse can change that unconditional love a mother has for her child. Michelle yeoh literally travels the entire multiverse to save her daughter and is stubborn (as she should be) in not letting her precious child go.

I didn't think this film would manage to make me cry when I stepped into the theatres to watch it for the first time. But so happened the first and, lo and behold, even after rewatching it today, I cried. The film manages to tap into every human emotion possible and makes you feel things. Makes me happy, sad, angry, surprised, bitter and so much more.

The aspect which I loved the most? The editing. If this film hadn't been edited the way it has been. I think it wouldn't be able to achieve the status it has achieved as of now. It's so good, it's mind-boggling. I will try my best to recreate some of this in the future if I can because this film really opens up a lot of editing techniques which I've rarely seen before.

Just watch this guys, it might become your favourite film of the year. A huge shoutout to A24 for producing this risky project and releasing it before the over-hyped Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness which, let's be honest, was barely about the multiverse and straight up disappointing.",10
14 March 2023,A temporary breath of fresh air.,"Sure, it's probably the best movie of the last decade, but that's not saying much in a decade riddled with medicore superhero films, covid interruptions, and so many streaming services dropping the bag on not being able to produce one goddamn good movie.

While watching the film, you get the impression that this could be the start of a new era of unapologetically weird, fun, moving films - lead by A24. Then you step out of the theater, and put the rose-tinted 3D glasses away, and discover that the movie is actually quite shallow and empty, and doesn't leave you thinking about it for weeks, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Inception would.

It's a sad fact that there's just not much to think or talk about with the actual story of the film. It's fun, enjoyable, and moving in the moment, but won't have you reevaluating your life.

But I'll be keenly looking forward to seeing whatever ke huy quan, A24, and The Danels make next! They have all proven their talent and I hope they'll continue to lead the next decade of film into weird, exciting, moving places.

This is a must-watch!",10
25 May 2022,An hour earlier would have been a great choice.,"A visual overload experience for a popular storyline that neither goes deep, nor is it original in any shape or form. The visuals were great and some of the findings were very clever but the repetitiveness of the same jokes over and over and over again was tiresome. I honestly felt that they didn't know how to finish the film. An hour earlier would have been a great choice.

3 July 2022,Best of 2022,"Diligently written, hilariously funny, aesthetically stunning, utterly moving, and deeply puzzling. That is what true cinema offers viewers. This has so far been the best movie of 2022. It offers you an explanation of what parallel universes and endless possibilities mean. If you've ever dreamt of leading an entirely different life from yours due to infinite possibilities, you should watch it now.

8 March 2023,All the bling without the substance,"I see the appeal of this movie but it left a bagel-hole in my soul. The pacing was kept at a good pace, appropriately balancing exposition, action, and character-development for the most part; although the plot slowed down too much in a couple different story-lines. It's generally well-produced, well-acted, and well-written--with a few plot holes still left in--but the narrative is rather self-indulgent and promotes a vacuous philosophy. The writers/directors unsuccessfully deaden their nihilistic bent with non-ironic, melodramatic sentimentality that rings hollow to the ears after all the pontificating that came before. The ultimate ideology of the movie undermines any gravitas or truthfulness of its final moments and its attempted rescue out of meaninglessness.

25 April 2022,"The story is pretty stupid, but pretty genius","The title says everything you need to know about the story. The cinematography was pretty impressive though. Shooting on Panavision I think was a smart choice specifically for the colors the sensors provide. An interesting and really good choice was the DP switching between anamorphic and spherical glass to differentiate universes. Very subtle, but had a huge impact on the visual story. The lighting was alright. There was the one cool effect that was achieved by triangulating Astera's Titan Tubes which gave quick-moving light that keyed different parts of the face. Other than that, I thought while stylistic, the lighting lacked originality. Besides the Triangulation of the Titan Tubes...that was cool, and definitely a striking catch-light in the reflections in the eye. I liked the use of soft lighting mixed with hard back lighting. It made the fight scenes pop and feel ""marvel-esc"" out of nowhere. Overall, great work by not only Larkin Seiple, but the entire G&E and PD.

23 February 2023,Hold on to your hats folks!!,"Hold on to your hats, folks, because ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is one wild ride of a movie. Directed by the duo known as Daniels, this film takes you on a journey through multiple universes, and let me tell you, it's heck of a trip!

Michelle Yeoh stars as a badass middle aged woman who discovers she has the power to travel through different dimensions. And who knew that power could come in so handy when you need to fight off a bunch of bad guys? Yeoh's performance is nothing short of amazing, and it's a testament to her talent that she can make kicking butt in multiple universes seem so effortless.

But what really makes this movie shine is the incredible supporting cast. Ke Huy Quan plays Yeoh's husband/mentor, and He is simply amazing, and of course their daughter Stephanie Hsu? Well, let's just say that if you're looking for a laugh, she's got you covered. Between the three of them, you'll be laughing, crying, and cheering throughout the entire movie, and not to forget about the one and only Jamie Lee Curtis who played completely different character comparing to her other movies and oh my! She nailed it.

The special effects in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" are mind-blowing, and the way the film plays with alternate realities is pretty trippy. I mean, there are moments where you'll feel like you're on an acid trip, and that's a good thing! (Not that I even tried it, but I heard from people who did!!) The cinematography is also gorgeous, and every shot looks like it was plucked straight out of a surrealist painting.

But what I really love about this movie is how it balances the absurdity with the emotional depth. Yes, there are moments where you'll be scratching your head and wondering what the heck is going on, but there are also moments where you'll be moved to tears. This movie has heart, and it's not afraid to wear it on its sleeve.

In short, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a movie that defies description. It's a mash-up of action, comedy, sci-fi, and drama, and it somehow manages to make all those genres work together seamlessly. If you're in the mood for something completely bonkers and unapologetically weird, this movie is for you. Just make sure you buckle up, because you're in for one hell of a ride.",9

4 April 2023,So bad I demanded my money back,"This movie was so bad I demanded my money back. I had heard that this was the best thing since the matrix. It was so cringe, pointless, and nonsensical. The Matrix is a great movie from 1999 when they still made good movies like Fight Clube and American Beauty. If this is a great movie today than civilization must be near its end.

Everyone says it, but I wanted to like this movie, that is why I rented it on Amazon Prime. I watched about half and could not take it anymore and stopped the movie. I went to review the movie on Amazon and it would not let me review it since I had not watched the whole movie. Keep in mind I paid to watch it.

I called customer service. I said ""let me review this movie, or, give me money back or I'm cancelling my Amazon account."" I meant it. They gave me my money back.

This movie was terrible. You'll want your two hours back.",1

It was crazy, and funny and beautiful all at once. I absolutely loved it! It was perfection! A must see for everyone! The acting was incredible and every one of the actors is deserving of their nominations! Whether they win or lose, i dont care, they made a movie that in my mind will change people and that is far more important than any award, but they are definitely deserving and I'm rooting for all them!

14 April 2022,"This generation's next visual spectacle, and that's not even the best part","There are times when a film can be so unabashedly creative and original that it can be hard to collect your thoughts or even pigeon-hole it into a genre. Sometimes, perhaps with films such as ""Swiss Army Man"" (2016) or ""The Lobster"" (2015), the creative overflow can convolute the tone and diminish the overall impact of the storytelling. However, when filmmakers can strike the perfect balance and deliver something that is a visual spectacle, gut-wrenchingly hilarious, and emotionally impactful, it can be true movie magic. ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is of the latter and it is one of the best films that I have seen in years.

Michelle Yeoh stars as Evelyn Wang who, in a day where her family's laundromat is being audited by the IRS, is sucked into the multiverse where she must work with other versions of herself to save the world. Multiverse narratives seem to be the new hot writing trend in Hollywood and can been seen everywhere from superhero flicks to sci-fi dramas. I think that it will be a real challenge to find one more masterfully created than ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"".

The film was written and directed by The Daniels and if sci-fi, comedy, drama isn't the best word to describe the film then how about this: CRAZY. We are talking dildo nunchuck-wielding, Mad Max on crack level of insanity, but, they somehow make it work. The action is beautifully helmed, the editing is perfectly chaotic, and the explosion of creativity is expertly realized. I have never seen a movie like this in my life.

Perhaps some of the action relied too much on slow motion and perhaps the first act was slow to start because of exposition but, honestly, the more I try and nitpick the more I realize the choices all serve the tone of the film. The real magic of ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is not the impressiveness of the Multiverse storytelling, but how it is used to serve the overall theme of the narrative. Family, marriage, maturity, parenthood - these are all themes that have countless films under their umbrella, but none of them are like this. Get out and support this film - it deserves your attention.

Grade: A+",10
24 April 2022,Insane And Heartwarming,"One of the most original films I've seen in a long time. If you think the new Doctor Strange film looks crazy wait until you watch this acid-trip. The Daniels managed to create a film that is wildly creative and entertaining whilst also making it profoundly touching. It's insane, unique, hilarious, emotional and I recommend you go out and support it.

4 June 2022,A wild ride of absolute brilliance,"My god. This film had everything I've ever wanted in a film. Absurdity, humor, chaos, depth, science-fiction, emotion, art, sooo many layers. I literally did not want it to end.

I went into it completely blind- I hadn't heard anything about it other than the title. And it blew me away.

My only regret is that I can't go back and watch it again for the first time. Maybe in a parallel universe ;)

27 February 2023,Pure Brilliance,"I've only seen this film once and that was shortly after it was released in theaters for the first time. Almost a year later I'm still in awe of the brilliance that this film is and the Daniels are two truly brilliant directors that deserve all the praise and accolades they are receiving, same for the rest of the cast and everyone involved. The film had me laughing, crying, and feeling so much hope and joy and I truly believe it will go down as one of the best films of the decade. This will be the film you see added to the Criterion Collection years from now, and will definitely be in the top 100 films of all time list. To put so many moving elements together (comedy, sci-fi, action, drama, mystery) all in one and make it work shows how talented the directors are and the cast was a cherry on top. Ke He Quan's performance was heartwrenchingly beautiful and what a truly wonderful comeback for him after a 20 year hiatus. An Oscar would be the most deserving award for him, especially after he thought his acting career was over despite being a child star. Stephanie Hsu is truly pheonomal and as her first major role, she takes the spotlight and gives so many layers and dimensions (literally) to her character which really showcases how talented she is and I hope she too can get an Oscar win. Lastly, Michelle Yeoh is brilliant. Perfect casting and I must give credit again to the Daniels for making a 50+ woman the lead protagonist in the film and really showing the world what a talent she is given her longevity in the film industry. This is the first film I've seen of hers but I have so much respect for her. While the lead actress category at the Oscars has some strong contenders, she too is worthy of the award for her performance.",
5 April 2023,"Really good and innovative, but it didn't deserve that much awards in the 95th Oscars","To start with, this is a good movie. It has some strengths, such as the script, which is original, even if there are obvious influences from movies like ""The Matrix"", the acting, which is really decent (although Michelle Yeoh has played better roles and didn't deserve, in my opinion, to be awarded with the ""Best Actress in a Leading Role"" Academy Award, and it is a fast-paced movie, so you won't get bored. Also, the direction is very nice, the visual effects are very impressive and it ultimately has an uplifting message, so it's not a waste of time. But, as I see it, it needn't have won the MOST awards in the 95th Oscars (7), whereas other films like ""Tar"", ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" and ""The Fabelmans"" went on to win none of the awards they were nominated for. It has some risque moments, as well. It's a genre-busting movie, that touches upon some serious issues, that it is fun to watch, too. I don't say it's a movie you shoud avoid, but to me it seems a bit overrated.

26 March 2023,Significance will be felt for years to come,"It's not at all an overstatement to suggest Kwan's film will be seen as the emotional encapsulation of a strange time in history. The primary narrative of a family's fight and the quotidian impact of the fractures within, are simple foundations for a poignant introspection of social undoing. This film tries to pull us all back from the brink; the fear, the hate, the spite, we all engorge upon. The intersectional personal stories are meant both as sincere examinations of the contemporary moment and also points reifying the brinksmanship we all engage in. Reviews will tank the movie simply because of its LGBTQ pointing sup-plot, others will lionize this content and ignore other nuances, perhaps of heteronormative qualities. None of this matters...Nothing matters. We really all are insignificant pieces of crap. Or desperately lost people who suffer the conceit of consciousness, abetted by time and history. But if all of that makes you feel alone, maybe you aren't But unity doesn't arrive through magnifying the grief of our struggles. Peace might come in letting go, and maybe being kind. We're all so convinced fighting defines your value. Sure, it does to a degree. But we might want to constantly evaluate that.",10
4 May 2022,"Fancy exterior, touching interior","Fantasy, sci-fi, action, Chinese on the surface. Immigration, generation gap, family reconciliation, relationships, life philosophy underneath.

As if the crazy front part has nothing to do with the realIty part, but they connect somehow. Be patient for the plot to get clear.

4 May 2023,Madness with a message,"A psychotic dream? An allegory of the universal struggle against nihilism? A family saga? Al three at once? Some do not get it - ""too wacky"". Poor souls, lost in an universe where failing laundry-ownerscan't be heroes. But hey, this is 21st century reality. Even Parliament can be stormed. So is it strange that Michelle Yao is a superhero and Jamie Lee Curtis is a villain? That parallel universes and the bagel of doom exist? If you appreciate the Big Lebowski, go. If you are the 'Go Superman-type, don't.

If you have no sense of the absurd, don't go. But if you do, see it. Especially if you are the type like me that watches The Big Lebowski over and over again because you enjoy madness with a message. And so what the message-heavy ending. As The Dude said: aggression will not stand, and if we ever needed reminders of that, it is now. Plus: enjoy references to everything ever made, from In The Mood For Love to Edward Scissorhands and Karate Kid to Ratatouille, beating Tarantien at his own game.

The concept was really a unique one but I really think this movie could have offered way more. It had all the ingredients to be a cult classic but turned out to be a draggy film with confusing storyline, the humors were unfunny most of the time. I wish Christopher nolan directed this film. Still I will recommend this film just because of the underline concept as there are very few films which can actually challenge our sperficial idea about life.

4 April 2023,"The most overrated pointless mess, travesty that it won so many Oscars","This movie is a jumbled, hurried mess of a bunch of ideas that I feel everyone jumped on the bandwagon because they felt they were supposed to give it flowers that it does not even come close to deserving. It's a fast-paced whirling dervish of nonsense with little to no point. And don't even get me started on all it's undeserved wins at the Oscars - an absolute low for the Academy Awards, when there were other films FAR more deserving in nearly every category. It's an instant headache and one of the most dizzying annoying pieces of try-hard ""art"" ever captured on film. I cannot overstate how un-clever this film is, while some critics and fans must have been tricked into thinking it was a ""must watch"" - in reality, it is 140 minutes of blah, blah, blah combined with some nauseatingly fast action sequences. Not only is this this not worth watching in the slightest, it's one of the biggest wastes of time out there. You will likely be told: ""just watch it!"" (If you haven't already), but if you don't want to suffer through nearly 2.5 hours of utter garbage, I'd suggest skipping it. My score of 3/10 is being kind, due to the obvious amount of hard work that all involved put into making this ridiculous thing. It's jumbled rubbish - don't believe the hype.",3
21 February 2023,"Great story, and Fun movie!","I went to watch this movie with my family on my birthday. I've been wanting to watch it for a while, but I thought it left the theaters, as soon as I saw it was still in theaters I said we needed to watch it. First we went to el con and mid previews the entire theater shut down. Because of this we were forced to rush to the park place mall and we snuck in the popcorn, and drinks from the other theater. Actually watching the movie was a great experience, everyone thought the movie was okay, but I thought Hereh movie was really good, funny and creative. They lost me at parts, but overall I had a great time watching this movie, and I hope to see it again.

11 April 2022,Absolutely Amazing,"Wonderfully charming. Yeoh is fantastic as usual. The actress playing the daughter was amazing. Shortround/Data was superb and well casted. I feel like Ive seen that grandfather too.

Topic hits home. Absolutely laughed out loud many times. Thought the plot was deeply thought out not too hard to follow. Give this movie ten stars. Probably best film I've seen in a decade. Extremely original.

30 May 2022,WTF JUST HAPPENED???,"MIND-BENDING, BRILLIANT, BONKERS, GENIUS, ALL AT ONCE!!!

The film is the b@st@rd child of Sliding Doors (the concept anyway) and The Matrix with more than a sprinkling of acid after a whole bag of magic mushrooms but somehow the cast and crew hold it together to deliver a genuinely mind blowing and entertaining movie. It is both poignant and laugh-out-loud funny. It was definitely NOT what I was expecting BUT in a good way!

Michelle Yeoh, is even better than her ever amazing self and is supported by Ke Huy Quan (Short-Round) and (is that?) Jamie Lee Curtis (yes it is!) as you've never seen her before. Stephanie Hsu is outstanding in her role as Yeoh's misunderstood daughter.

Do not miss EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE whatever universe you are from!

22 May 2022,Most original movie this decade.,"Don't usually feel compelled to review a movie, but Wow!!! Really enjoyed this crazy feast for the brain. The acting, the directing, the emotions...really hit the nail on the head. One of the weirdest movies I have ever seen, but by the end I felt like I had been on an emotional roller coaster. They take a lot of different chances in this one. Most of them work pretty good. If you are looking for something different and don't mind getting hit hard in the feels. Please give this one a chance. Ill definitely be recommending it.

30 July 2023,"And, somewhere in an alternate universe, the Oscar goes to a 'Rick and Morty' episode","Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), apparently the most underachieving and least content Evelyn in the multi-verse, learns to tap into the potentials and abilities of other multiverse Evelyns when she is recruited to battle the evil Jobu Tupaki, who has created a deadly metaphor than could destroy all of the infinite realities. I like this sort of story and enjoyed the film, which was technically spectacular and quite funny at times, but I am surprised at the gushing praise from the critics and the film's huge haul at the 95th Oscars (disclaimer: I haven't seen the competition, but I have seen most of the films with similar Oscar successes, and I don't think EEAaO is in the same league).

21 May 2022,A mulitverse of brilliance and heart,"The movie brilliantly melds concepts into an unforgettable sci-fi masterpiece headlined by Michelle Yeoh. You will never forget this movie. You think I jest? Wait until you watch it! It rolls from hilarious, to heart breaking, to inspirational, sometimes mixing all of them together - fulfilling the prophecy of its title. Michelle Yeoh gives an incredible performance, anchoring every single scene, no matter how ridiculous, with a sense of reality.

This is a movie that aimed at a million targets, and hit every single one of them. Sci-fi creators across all media will be inspired by this movie for decades to come.

Will it win an Oscar? It damn well should.

4 December 2022,Good beginning. Good ending. Mess of a middle.,"Good beginning establishing the characters and a glimpse of where the story was headed. Good ending tying things up and brining their point to bear. Mess of a middle that needed serious tightening up and editing. Was all over the place caught up in visuals that while interesting did not further the story. Way too long. Could have cut 45 minutes and not effected the story. Michelle Yeoh did an amazing job as she always does. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job in her offbeat role. That being said, outside of Michelle Yeoh the characters were underdeveloped. I wanted to like this film. I had been looking forward to seeing it. And I did. Once will be enough.

14 February 2023,Acting was superb,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

26 April 2022,Very introspective and irreverent,"One of the best original movies I have seen in a long time and it goes to show you what can be created when Hollywood studios make way for original content and not just franchise bait. This movie was sci-fi, action, comedy, and family drama all wrapped in one with a fantastic story and great cinematography and lighting. The story constantly keeps us asking what the meaning of life truly is and how our choices can truly butterfly effect something down the road but this movie is one that'll have you thinking about it for day after.

8 March 2023,It's a marmite film... and I LOVE marmite!,"The pace is insane. The plot line is proposterous. The cinemotography is gorgeous. And certain characterisations are bizarre.

EEAAO is certainly a one off, and needs to be watched and embraced with an open mind. I totally get why there are haters but I loved it. The film is deliciously layered and Yeoh supported by a middle aged Short Round are superb. And Jamie Lee Curtis looks like she is having the time of her life.

I cant remember a recent film where I was moved, laughed or intrigued in equal measure. There are no spoilers here. Let's just say that this unique film stretches your intellectual and emotionally intelligence and if your mind is up for it, you're in for quite a ride.

Magnificent. I can't work.out what this film really is but I love it all the same.",10
19 May 2022,A MASTERPIECE !!!,"This is a must watch movie for everyone including old and young. It is so interesting to watch such a masterpiece created by two ""evil geniuses"" as quoted by Michelle Yeoh.

This movie has been a multi universe kind of a gig that shows us about family, love and kindness. All the characters are just so amazing to watch and as well they brought their best acting.

It is one of a kind movie which I think comes out like every 10 years or so. So please if you can go watch it, it is worth it and again, two thumbs up for the actors and directors and producers and everybody who took part to create this amazing and fantastic movie.

20 May 2022,Great message regarding compassion in the face of nihlism,"The movie has a lot of heart. It has a low budget but everything is executed so well from the special effects making good use of the camera, the few settings used in such creative manners, and the few actors that portray the variety of roles so well. The movie is a joy to experience.

16 March 2023,film doesn't understand women,"The movie doesn't understand its main character. This is clearly a masculinist interpretation of a remarkable woman's ingenuity. I could give many examples but will settle on her portrayal as one who bailed on all of her dream projects, such as singing, kung fu, cooking, and so on, and barely holds herself together for survival. What the hell? She had a family and a business to hold together. It is as though the movie blames her for life being difficult, and then is amazed when she pulls it together. Women do that every day. The film is far more sympathetic to the husband, so befuddled by the amazing women around him he wants to bail with a divorce. I read that this story was originally written for Jackie Chan, with a male lead. Maybe that would have worked because the writers clearly don't understand women. Watch it for the acting. Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis are both amazing and deserve their accolades. And yes, the cinematography, costumes, and other technical aspects are excellent.

30 May 2022,Finally something original,"I've wrote so many bad reviews the past couple of years cos it seems everything that has comes out over the last 4 years is either; terrible boring ideas & stories for a film that should of never being greenlit or just unoriginal rehashes & full on remakes that just utterly disappoint. Bad writing & average direction everywhere. They all seem to have the same message aswell. Everything over the past few years is the same crap with the same message. The exceptions have been few & far between. Directors like Denis Villeneuve & Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu have been a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stagnated period. However thankfully this is very much an exception & something completely unique, inspired & totally original. So what are you waiting for? Go watch it.

10 March 2023,Everything Everywhere All At Once Was Just A Not So Special Family Drama Story That Adds With Cool Special Effects And Some Multiverse Elements In It That Didn't Work With The,"Everything Everywhere All At Once was just a not so special family drama story that adds with cool special effects and some Multiverse elements in it that didn't work with the real story at all for me, emotionally didn't work, blown away by it? Not really surprisingly, and it's too long, ok performances by all the cast and with all the flaws and it did might sound harsh but it wasn't truly a bad movie overall but it just not the one that at very least ok too for me so i was still pretty much disappointed, despite the cool special effects and the Multiverse thing, the real story of the film was really my major problem because it didn't fit with the other side of the story, and if you erase all the Multiverse stuff, it might be even work more, it just doesn't connect, it's a mixed bag of a feeling, it felt very forced, again i like the super weird Multiverse thing that they did, the special effects, the style, the color, the lighting, the cinematography, the score, and performance was still ok, but as a whole combined with the real story, it didn't work for me, and it's surprisingly becoming my new unpopular opinion on possibly the most talked film of 2022 and the one that got a lot of praise, not for me.",6

It is a shame, because I had high hopes for this movie. I just don't understand the hype. They tried too hard to be weird. I think at the end they were trying to pull the heartstrings, but I was too confused to know for sure. I'm not even sure what the movie was about. I think it had something to do with familial relations, or perhaps current tax laws? Whatever it was, they should have had an epileptic seizure warning.

17 January 2023,A Beautiful Mess,"The title describes itself perfectly because everything is really everywhere and happening all at once during 2 hour 15 mins.

I kept asking myself 'What the hell is going on, what kind of absurdism is that ?' in the first hour of the movie. I even thought that, the directors were trying so hard to be philosophical and fathomless. I'm sure many people would quit watching it after a couple of minutes, which they SHOULD NOT !!! That's why I decided to shoot a review, as it may help others to appreciate the movie and not to quit watching. The movie asks for patience from its audience, but it pays the reward.

It starts with a unique storytelling that I think, I've never seen in any movies before. It's absurd, surreal, and too complex to comprehend if it really tries to show something to the audience or just tries to be as it is. As I've stated above it's a must watch but hard to finish. The first half of it makes you smile a lot, and cringe a lot at, as some scenes are the goofiest ever, without spoilers, I could say the ways people use to jump from universe to universe linking another version of them will shock you.

The second part of the movie (approx. After 1.30), the tone of it completely changes, when the story starts to unfold. All the philosophical tone, and absurdism turn to an emotional rollercoaster between generations. And here we have the most unique way of telling the story of most ordinary people (a Chinese immigrant couple on the verge of divorce who works a laundry in the USA dealing with daily issues of life). Without further ado, I have to say that I've never got so emotional for a long time, and I even cried, and tbh I cried a lot.

I haven't watched such a unique movie since Parasite. I just loved the movie so much. I also loved the acting of all the cast, but especially Michelle Yeoh and Ke Hyu Quan. Michelle Yeoh deserves all the awards for which she has been nominated for her flawless performance. I think it's absolutely one of the best movies of 2022 (and all time) and best contender for Best Motion Picture Academy Award.",9
15 May 2022,A real work of genius in my eyes,"Possibly the best film I've seen & I've seen many. So much is going on from kung fu ballets, multiverse story, NSFW visual jokes yet emotionally deep & engaging. A real work of genius in my eyes. If only I could give it 11/10.

17 February 2023,I am glad I watched it but it was heavy handed,"Glad I watched it. I enjoy seeing a slice of life: how other people deal with the aggravation of life. Especially with all the lying via social media..

And the message here was a fine one. I do like the underlying premise at the end that due to the treatment of the daughter by the mother, the mother will have to work extra hard to win her back. I think that is a lesson a lot of parents of teens and young adults should heed especially since having teens is like a ""get out of jail free"" card that parents can use to shield their own crappy treatment of their teenage kids.

However, the fight scenes wore thin on me. I liked the beginning as we got to know the world and the ""technology"". It took me a while to figure out what was happening. But then we had too many fight scenes and too pat a wrap up.

22 July 2022,"Weirdly Pleasing, But not as Great as Everyone Says it is","Everything Everywhere All at Once literally places everything everywhere all at once. As a result, it's just a big, dizzy and prolonged adventure-comedy with lots of humour, touching morals and imaginative messes. There's also frequent changes between spoken languages that can be slippery to catch up with and it would've been best at a runtime of under 2 hours, but 110 minutes or more would do the trick. So like most people would highly disagree on and be able to make fair points that overshadow the not-so-great things in the film, it's a bit of an overrated movie, but is it worth watching?

If you have plenty of free time on your hands, Everything Everywhere All at Once is an action-adventure-comedy loaded with plenty of imaginative sci-fi stuff written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. Their film is very trippy, original and completely weird, which is the entire point. It centres on an interesting but aging Chinese woman who happens to be an unlikely hero as she must fight the creative dangers of the multiverse to save the world. Give it a shot, because it's either something you'll love or hate, and you can usually tell the pacing at the halfway point.

This movie presents a ton of extremely weird, utterly strange and very trippy visuals and effects during the main character's insane adventure. And it's really just an adventure film, although there's frequent moments that are brutally hilarious, like the hot dog fingers and the other crazy stuff. Thankfully, the story is original and that makes sure to entertain you. But to look at the touching elements, this movie does shed light on some parent-child issues and leaves very nicely. Watch this film is you are looking for a bizarrely weird adventure-comedy, but it's just overhyped.

12 April 2022,The most imaginative film you will see all year,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is more than likely one of the most imaginative movies you will see all year if not ever. The way in which it delves into the concept of the multiverse is truly breathtaking from both a visual and symbolic standpoint. All of the costumes and locations are vibrant and meaningful to the main characters in more ways than one. This makes every setting and every decision these characters make feel extremely important throughout the entire movie. There's a ton of multiverses that are explored too and the same can be said about the symbolic messages and ""hidden"" meanings behind this film. The story was executed so brilliantly that there's plenty of time for audiences to adore every single character, provide intense sci-fi action, tons of humor, and serious tones/themes together seamlessly. One minute you might find yourself laughing pretty hard, the next you might be trying to hold back a tear or two. Everywhere All At Once has a lot to say regarding the human condition yet somehow manages to still be a sci-fi epic. A24 movies aren't for everyone but the originality and amazing execution from a filmmaking standpoint is simply undeniable here.",9
23 May 2022,Its ended as family war,"RATED 7/10 Language: English

Nice fantasy move made based on family sentiments and values evolved in the new culture. Nice try with mixture of all genres including horror. The movie starting was so interesting and it get so much dragged with mother-daughter sentiment towards end.

I was expecting some universal war but ended as family war.

One time watchable...

30 January 2023,The title says it all,"Everything everywhere all at once. That's it. Yes, it's about multi-universe matrix like alternative realities and weird other worlds, and how the smallest moment or tiniest decision can effect you everything and everybody. It sets out to be hyper clever and is supposed to be insightful, but I just found it very very very annoying, hyperactive, and just plain silly. Was I supposed to care about these characters? Was there a point to this film? It is technically brilliant, and Michelle Yeoh and the cast do a spirited job, but, honestly, given the idea, a much better film could have been made on this theme. I think it'll probably appeal to those who are into computer gaming, The Matrix movies or fantasy and sci-Fi, however, it certainly didn't do much for me.

16 January 2023,Beautiful movie,"Originally when I first went to see the film I really didn't expect much of it, I just thought of it as another film of the bunch... how wrong I was about that. This movie has a heavy underlying theme while still managing to remain comical and interesting from the beginning to end, it manages to be funny, while sad at the same time and through the use of a semi erratic cinematography it manages to convey that chaotic feeling on which the film is based about. Truly a spectacular film that not only deserves the recognition of the academy, but of the public altogether, truly an enjoyable near perfect film.

26 March 2023,An imaginatory masterpiece,"Let me start with that the people who rate this low are probably the ones too simple to comprehend the idea of the multiverse and too slow to follow and understand the plot...although they'll claim it's none of those. This movie packs so much thought and imagination into a good two hours that it'll make your brain fire in all cylinders, and your neurons clap in joy from the impulses hitting them. It's a visual marvel. Beyond that it bares an intriguing storyline with a ""nobody"" protagonist, who's meaningless life will find meaning in this maze of universes. Besides this it is action packed, at times brutal yet wierdly funny. It is also very refreshing that with the cast it takes a break from the generic hollywood actors/actresses and boasts talented professionals beyond the plastic faces of the industry. A must watch.

21 June 2022,Mental Rollercoaster?,"The opening shot is a cluttered living space above a family laundromat. That clutter defines the film for me, while the two-fold adjacent universe of life/work offers a simple hint of adjoining ""universes"" to be explored through-out the long, but enjoyable movie.

My 19 year old boys loved the film, I appreciate how it flirted with philosophies, before finding a pretty safe space in humanism. Although the existential rock by rock shots had an extra appeal for me. Wong-Kar Wei fans will be happy here, and while my kids might not want to hear it, this film stretches quantum and cinematic strings to connect to the superhero genre and MCU.

You want CGI and choreographed fight scenes, you got 'em. Jokes are very carefully thrown and land gently. The use of a surreal gesture for escape velocity in channeling between universes might have been a bit overused. Perhaps the filmmakers subscribe to ultimately to the Cosmic Joke.

The universe(s) here are big, and beyond those for me the film tries to do too much, for too many people. Both my kids and myself really enjoyed the director's previous foray, where they were mostly confined to an island grotto. Yet there was still plenty of room for the outlandish in that smaller but purposeful ""Switchblade"" of a film.

The notion of a metaverse seems to be ramping up more and more these days in various forms, whether to feed a supernatural hunger for teens weaned off religion, or offer some sense of justice that too often feels pay-walled off for those imprisoned here in the lower quanta of society. I feel an agnostic reaction welling up inside me.

Probably overthinking it, but the film does invite such overthinking...even if it serves best as a giant mental rollercoaster, and you wind up exactly where you started.",7
14 March 2023,You people are brutal and too quick to judge,"This film screams comedy, art and overall madness! It's supposed to be fast paced and keep your heart rate up! The actors did a phenomenal job in their roles and that's why they won their Oscars!! Everyone is so quick to judge this film and say it's too fast and doesn't make sense. Maybe put on the subtitles, actually listen to the story as it's playing out and MAYBE then you might actually see just how amazing this film is. I have a degree in filmmaking and all I can say is this is definitely going to be in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. The Daniels did amazing with this film and I can't wait to see what they do next.

23 March 2023,Half Of This Works,"I saw Everything Everywhere All at Once seemingly after everyone else I know already saw it. Most everyone I know had for the most part great things to say about it. I went into my recent viewing feeling very optimistic that I would have a highly fulfilling viewing experience. I was correct, but only to a point. So this film has a lot going on visually, audioly, and story-wise. It does indeed appear fresh and unique to me. However, I only felt the more serious/tender moments of the film. As for the humorous and 'surprising' aspects that so many others seemed to love, those just did not hit a chord with me. That's disappointing because I can see how much was put into those elements, but I actually laughed very little throughout this film. As for the performances, the overall cast does a very fine job and they all play their parts well.

21 May 2022,Entertaining and Original,"Wow. Where to begin? Without giving spoilers; this was the most entertaining, well made, intriguing and heart warming film I have seen in years.

The action was fantastic and hilarious, the concept original and gripping. Michelle Yeoh and all the supporting cast were flawless. Best film of 2022 and it's only May.

31 July 2022,"Original? Yes! But this was SUPPOSED to be the baseline, Hollowood!","Don't get me wrong. This movie had its moments and had me laughing my axx off quite a number of times as well as clap sometimes.. but hey, that's because I was still coming off of sunken cost fallacy and what an utter garbage Gerard Butler's Last Seen Alive was (last seen movie before this...) so there's that.

My first reaction to it after finishing it was 8 or 10, but then when the buzz calmed down and the lights faded, I realized we might have been duped.

This movie felt like Shen Yun-meet-Mission Impossible or rather a Jackie Chan Kung-Fu movie. There are some absolutely amazing cinematography and fine editing skills... but that's about it. Some of the lines were cool and many scenes funny .. and that's it.

It's like a big ol hot fudge sundae or whatever.. which you relish only once. I cannot for the love of my life imagine rewatching it esp. With the DISGUSTING bloody dildo scene.

And what was the raison d'etre for it anyway? To 'shock' viewers? Really?

And true to Hollywood they have to insert some woke meme about a lesbian female teenage daughter. Jeezus Christ.

I might be unduly harsh, but I just want to balance it out. Had it came out in late 90s or early 2000s it would be considered ""competitive"". I mean this is what Hollywood (Hollowood?) is supposed to be!! THIS should be the baseline. This is the orignality and creativity we expect with ALL movies.

Guess public is numbed out by dumb boring ditzy Marvel movies and boilerplate formulaic action movies like Grey Man with Ryan Gosling and Last Seen Alive, that we are acting we saw the promised land. Halle frikkin lulah indeed.

If you wanna be pretentious and watch philosophical movies and write pretentious reviews then there are in spate.

Tree of Life, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pi, Stranger Than Fiction, Truman Show...

This is not one of them. At least not miles by my ""rewatching"" standard.",6
19 May 2022,A bad Kung Fu Hustle with the story of a terrible Rick and Morty episode,"If you have seen Rick and Morty, or any other multiverse saga (like Jet Li's The one), you know the drill: in the infinite multiverse some nihilist is out of control and threatens to destroy everything. Now jump from universe to universe trying to stop him.

But you haven't seen it with an insane amount of ridiculous Kung Fu fights (because with good fights, Jet Li's The One has already done it), one of them involving two of the fighters trying to land butt first on a buttplug and a dildo, and succeeding and having the dildo protruding the rest of the fight until it is pulled out by the protagonist.

I don't know how this piece of crap got high praise. It is vulgar, repetitive, derivative with not one fresh idea or execution. It feels like it is a parody of something, like the Matrix, perhaps. But even as parody it fails because most of the attempts are humor are cringey at best, vulgarly offensive at worst.

What a letdown. I was hoping for an intelligent take on the multiverse, or to be impressed by fresh ideas. Instead I got a infantile potty humor Kung Fu Hustle, that goes nowhere.

But the worst part of this terrible movie? The characters. Or lack of them. The whole movie is so preoccupied with explaining its Universe and jumping from fight to fight, that it forgets to have engaging characters that are something more than rebellious teenage daughter, worried mom and submissive husband.

I can't remember a movie that had such a promising trailer, letting me down this bad.

For those who have not seen it, a warning I wish I had: if your hopes for this movie goes above having a buttplug fight, and someone putting snot into someone's mouth, recalibrate those expectations. This is not a psychological thriller with great mindfcs. It is a terrible, terrible movie.",1
4 July 2022,Great commentary on the existential dread we all face & the power of love.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",8
12 May 2022,Move over Nolan,"This is the first time I'm writing a movie review. But look. This takes first place for my absolute favorite film. It's goofy, daring, moving, thoughtful, thrilling, mindbending and it all works so well. It makes light of the dark and dark of the night and climax so good you'll have to change pants.

There are moments where you're like ""I cant believe this is happening in a movie"" yet it makes sense and os such a memorable theatre experience.

I might go bankrupt buying tickets to see this daily.

27 February 2023,The moment you realize,"Exceptional movie that turns a common potential troubling issue into a visual feast of both exclusion, inclusion and diversity and singularity within the stranglehold of monotony and chaos. Where even stereotypes and racism are touched and erased. When you pass all multiverse that are concerned with fundamental issue of life. In all its forms.

Nothing has been taboe in this highly entertaining whirlwind of visual excellence.

Original in many aspects of cinematic storytelling

Could we have experienced the upper layer on a simpler way? Yes ofcourse. But that would not have original nor does that do justice to what most people feel in these situations. Fact and the matter is that most dealing with issues and inner conflict with a rollercoaster of emotions and a storm of thoughts.

This film does justice to these periods and in this way all what you weirdly feels very relatable.

In short: Everything everywhere all at once A 9 from me.",9
15 May 2022,"So many questions and no answers, but that's OK","We don't know the rules that the world in this movie operates. As information and scenes are presented, it clarifies and confuses us all at the same time. Is the movie playing by its own rules or is it being sloppy? Even if you pay attention, you won't be able to tell. But maybe that's the point.

If you were to ask: What is this movie about? I could give a pretty long list. It's about love, family, suicide, life, pain, confusion, the meaning of life, anger, happiness, kindness, being OK with imperfection (see title).

Relatively early on, we hear the phrase ""Nothing matters"" and we feel how true that is. Then, the movie tries to convince us otherwise. Successfully? I don't know. But it makes us feel that in this one moment in this character's life, some things matter even if in the infinite span of the universe it may not.

I feel that I should not be rating this movie, but instead giving it a N/A rating. It's not perfect, it can't be, but it does make the viewer emotional and think. I've watched a ton of movies in the last couple of months/years and my first reaction is to point out all the things wrong with them. But with this one, I feel like that's not what it's about. But I'm not sure I can answer what it's about in a way that gets to it's essence (see title, ""everything""). But let me give it a desperate attempt.

Life is hard. You're not perfect. Don't give up.",10
26 June 2022,Beware the Bagal!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the film but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. If you come in from a night out that included alcohol, leave this film until another time!

Seeing a Jamie Lee Curtis as the Tax Inspector, plus others, was shock. Well the whole film was a shock.

I summed up the film at the end, with that was weird - but I liked it!

Some funny bits in it, and some touching scenes too.

17 April 2023,Genius Movie With Deep Meanings,"This movie is genius in it's story telling and the very weird and confusing way it did it. Many dislike the way of how extremely weird it was but underneath all of that a deep emotional and realistic story is told based on the generational trauma of asian families. Many people can relate to the true experience of this film and the daughter's sad story. I believe you need to understand past the hot dog fingers and weird diverse realities in the multiverse to develop a love and understanding of the family's story and relationships. But you need to pay attention of the detail of each reality to also understand the mother's view on her life, just don't let the realities make you think this movie is very weird and ""tries too hard to be unique"". Everything in this movie is shown the way it is and happens the way it does for a reason and it all plays into the family's relationships, especially the mother and daughter. The movie can end up leaving you confused and wanting answers for the deeper meaning and so you will probably end up searching on the web and watching videos dissecting this movie, I did and I recommend it because it is nice learning more and more about the meaning and symbolism. If you don't enjoy being confused, weirded out, too many elements of a story all playing into one, and just a simple story line enjoyer then you probably shouldn't watch this movie-unless you want to change your view. I personally watched the movie twice, the first time I didn't cry, was left confused, over stimulated by the many things happening, weirded out, and mixed opinions. But, the second time I watched this movie I went in with a open mind, dissected everything that happened, interpreted many symbols, and paid great attention to the detail, then I ended up crying towards the ending as I finally understood the mother and daughter's relationship. Overall a very well made movie, beautiful and diverse cinematography and story telling, unique symbolism, and amazing acting. 9.5/10 I recommend to people with open minds and those who take every attention to detail seriously!",9
15 December 2022,Performances save the movie,"I have about twenty minutes left of this movie and to be honest, I've been wanting it to end for about an hour or so. While I do applaud the filmmakers for creating such a unique world and overall, story...

A lot of the times, the film appears to try too hard; you know to be creative, different and overall, experimental. Sort of feels Oscar baity at times.

The action scenes are impressive and it is neat to see a bad*** female lead. The performances from Michelle and Jamie are STRONG. But I think Ke is the true scene stealer in this entire film! I enjoy his scenes the most; his performance is a great mix of comedy and drama.

I'm not surprised if this film scores a lot of Oscar nomins but in the end, a lot of moments are confusing and difficult to follow/",6
10 April 2022,Absolutely incredible,"You have to see it to believe it. A movie of indescribable and incomprehensible brilliance in all the best possible ways. Stephanie Hsu and Michelle Yeoh give the performances of their career.

31 January 2023,Good not Great,"I liked this movie. Really nice editing, production design, acting, creativity, costume design and cinematography. It was fun to watch and engaging. That being said, it was a little forgettable. Maybe it's because the story is too predictable, the lessons too cliched and the character arcs too overused. It comes down to discovering the importance of relationships through magic (in this case universe jumping). From It's a Wonderful Life to Turning Red, it's been done over and over. The bottom line is, this movie is cool looking, fun to watch and pretty funny while not leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. It's a good picture but far from the Best Picture.

11 March 2023,Either a 10 Star or a 1 Star Rating - No Middle Ground,"IN A WORLD...where diversity and inclusion matter more than quality or even making sense, this is what rises to the top of the heap. Reviewers and award presenters are falling all over themselves slobbering over this movie. I tried to watch it when it first came out and it was just too silly and stupid to get through more than a few minutes. I tried harder this time, but I still couldn't make it to the end.

Everything Everywhere All at Once took 3:29 to introduce a lesbian scene. And then shortly after, the daughter mentions that her girlfriend can also serve to check off another box in the diversity bingo game we're all playing these days in TV and movies.

""She's half Mexican."" She chimed in at the 5:50 mark. Why not give her one more inclusivity* attribute to win the trifecta? They could ring a bell to celebrate.

(*Ha, this recently-invented word, ""inclusivity,"" is so new that it flagged the spell-check on this site).

I have nothing at all against inclusivity and diversity, just don't throw your arm out of the socket patting yourself on the back about it. All it took was a stroke of a pen, so you haven't really done anything. Why do cultural warriors always act like they've been down in the trenches fighting? Furthermore, diversity may lead to equality, something any thinking person favors, but diversity, in itself is not quality. You include representatives of every racial and ethnic group, along with every sexual persuasion on the planet and the movie can still be stupid. For me, this movie was unwatchably stupid.

Joyless people working themselves to death for no apparent reason. Are they starving to death? Why would anyone kill themselves over a laundromat, and evidently, they're stiffing the IRS on their taxes. Sorry, folks, that's part of our system.

The woman is either a terrible actress, or the director doesn't understand acting beyond a childish level of the art, or both. I defy anyone to watch this with the sound muted and just study her ridiculously-exaggerated facial expressions and then tell me she can act.

White lady bad. The tax woman is actually shown as evil, a grotesque slob who is attacked physically, but that's OK because she's a white lady. Wow, nice reverse stereotyping. You'd better be able to take a joke if you are Caucasian these days (wait, can I even say Caucasian?) because White people are awful according to the new rules. A bunch of IRS security guards are viciously brutalized, but that's OK, too, because they are white, or white-ish (even their uniforms are white for the subtlety-impaired).

Here's the thing, I CAN take a joke, I really can. I just don't have to laugh at them if they aren't funny, or if they don't make any sense at all, like everything in this film. The ""alphaverse"" and ""verse jumping"" that this movie throws at the audience could be described as infantile and stupid, at least by me, but a lot of folks are eating this up as fast as it can be shoved down their throats.

Furthermore, at 2h 19m it's way too long.",1
20 January 2023,Pure randomness. So good.,"Only just streamed this last night after missing it at the movies.

Man, what a rollercoaster ride!

There isn't a whole lot it doesn't have: there's tonnes of action, drama, & comedy, all expertly blended together with fast-paced editing & mind altering visuals. So, so random but so very good as well. What a triumph!

There's so much going on in this movie that I'll have to re-watch it a few times to really appreciate all of the small details that were lovingly & painstakingly put into this.

I read somewhere that the movie was shot in just over a month, too, which is mind blowing in itself, given all the different sets, costume changes, re-shoots of same/similar sequences in completely different settings, etc...

The acting all around is great & the action is, likewise, amazing. Such a fun, seemingly chaotic but actually well thought-out storyline, but the editing really brings it all together. I'm glad the directors had a clear vision of what they were doing as I reckon the actors would have been pretty confused most of the way through it & probably only pretended they understood how it would all pan out, until all the madness was finally stitched together for the theatrical release.

Great movie. Go & see it.",9
14 January 2023,Excellent movie,"I dont usually write reviews for movies but I felt i needed to after watch this gem. I am a very depressed and sad person who has a hard time see the good in life and the future. This movie made me realize that all of us need to open our minds and start to enjoy life and all we have. We as a human race need to start to come together and love one another again. We need to see what we have right in front of us and enjoy life because it will be over before you know it and we have wasted our whole lives worrying and complaining when we should have been doing what we love and bringing love to our whole. Please see this movie and take it to heart.

22 March 2023,Genre bending masterpiece,"EEAAO is the kind of movie you should watch in theaters. I watched it on the plane, what a shame! Even so, i was blown away by that experience and it's the best movie ever made in my opinion.

The beautiful Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan deliver like nobody's business. The acting in this movie in general is phenomenal! There's no such thing as a weak scene in it, every second is truly mesmerising. The film plays with your senses and draws you in completely.

The first half does a good job of explaining the characters and the multiverse, the second half is full of action and plot twists.

The score is this movie's only weakness. It's not bad, nothing about this movie is bad, it's just not very special in my opinion. But that doesn't really matter since you're so invested in the story and the visuals.

Get your popcorn and drink, sit back and relax and get ready for something fresh, heart touching and jaw dropping. This movie is a piece of art.",10
9 January 2023,Everyone everywhere will not agree,"Plenty to froth about here. It's a movie you know for sure will have many mixed opinions. A cocktail of movie genres in one. Die hard action fans will love the action and scratch their heads on everything else. Comic fans will drool with a staring gaze until they choke on a hilarious scene. Romantics and those seeking emotion will find it here , just have to wait till the final 20 minutes or so . Personally, thoroughly enjoyed it. I would put it in my top 5 for 2022. I found some deep moments I related to and I'm sure at one point or another everyone will find a deep connection somewhere at least once as it touches on such a broad spectrum of life experiences.

25 January 2023,Warped Time warp...and over overlong,"Michelle Yeoh is a spectacular actress as seen in this film, knowing that nothing was done in one take, and her myriad of expressions and countless character shifts are truly unique. But this crazed film defies easy analysis. For a fantasy time-warp / character-switch-around, adventure-swirl, this one defies clarification. A 'fantasy', if this is one, must have a kernel of truth from which it moves, even 'Godzilla' or 'Back to the Future' or 'SpiderMan-No Way Home'...or...you-name-it. This one starts with taxes and failing business with a subplot idea of the daughter's live life. It ends with the daughter again...creating the question 'Why did we go through all of this in the first place?' Editing is mammoth with even rocks cascading down on the audience. It runs about eight (??) hours or seems to be even more!! You can try to play the game of 'What's it all about Alfie?' but I am one who just doesn't care. Just save Ms. Yeoh!

26 October 2022,Comedy? Action? Philosophical Discourse?,"In my opinion, a truly great film manages to convey profound ideas and feelings to the audience under the guile of entertainment. It is rare to find a film that manages this balancing act as beautifully as Everything Everywhere All At Once.

The film tells the story of a middle-aged woman who is trying to save her business and her family from ruin when the responsibility to save the world from a terrible adversary is thrust upon her. The film makers embrace the absurdity of the premise in a singularly ingenious way. By all means, this is the story of an existential crisis on a cosmic scale, and it delivers an exhilarating resolution to the crisis.

Casting in this film is beyond perfect. Michelle Yeoh's protagonist feels real which is the highest praise I can muster and Stephanie Hsu matches her in every way. The cinematography in this film is surreal and trippy which goes with the territory of making a film about existentialism and the multiverse. The film jumps from fast paced action sequences to absurdly calming moments of quiet and calm all of which is made possible because of wonderful editing.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why this is a great film but I give it 10 stars because it left me with a deeper understanding of life and relationships. I will eagerly wait for the Daniels to come up with more absurd projects. They have made me a fan for life.",10
17 March 2023,Sycophantic Oscars. Entertaining at best.,"This year the US sucks up to China with 7 Oscars!

That tells it all since this movie is entertaining at best and not Oscar material at all.

I came to watch this movie for Doctor-Strange-like 3rd eye, just to find out it's a fake eye, put on Michelle's forehead for no reason!

When I first saw the 3rd eye and the multiverse theme in the movie trailer, I was sure that I was going to watch a Doctor Strange parody comedy, not an Oscar movie.

The only moral of this movie is that ""death is peace"" - if you're too fed up with all the craziness, pain, evil in this world then death is the only way out. On the bright side, it means ""to live is to struggle"" - if you choose to live then there's no other way but to get used to the daily struggle and try to find happiness in everything. That's all.

Other than that, this movie is an average overplotted yet entertaining comedic tearjerker. Well done, Academy.",6
13 March 2023,Is It Just Me Or....,"This film has been called a modern masterpiece, it has overwhelmingly positive reviews, it won 7 OSCARS. And the only thing I can say about this movie is that it was okay. I've seen a lot of reviews giving it a 1/10, which just isn't fair because there are some redeeming factors. The fights scenes were pretty cool, the visuals are interesting (nothing outstanding), and the acting is decent, but no Oscar-winning performances in my opinion.

What makes this movie a disappointment for me was that I was left bored and emotionless. I couldn't take this movie and its characters serious. It's just so goofy and weird and then it tries to go all serious at the end. Maybe it's not for me, because it's definitely a film not for everyone.

This movie was just a disappointment for me. For a movie to be called a masterpiece, for it to win 7 Oscars, it has to be perfect or at least close to perfect. But the plot was boring and it held no tension. It's goofy tone removed all the seriousness at the end. Everything Everywhere All at Once was average, and it's definitely a movie not worth 7 Oscars.",5
13 August 2022,"Very very very Random, Weird, Funny and Wholesome Film","The first part of the film is fast paced, very random and weird. But in the second part, events took an unexpected turn. The film suddenly makes you question your purpose on life. You realize that the universe is immensely vast and nothing matters. Then the film strikes the final blow and your heart is filled with emotions.

Easily one of the best films I have ever watched. The creators were very successful in reflecting the soul of 2020s. This film is like a full feature film version of the popular videos titled ""Never let them know your next move"".

Quirkiness of this film may not be for everyone, but I think everyone must watch this film. 10/10.

5 April 2022,A self aware crazy film that you can appreciate,"To state the obvious. This is a crazy movie. It's over the top. It's extremely convoluted. It's a complete mess. But that's what the filmmaker was going for. And while I think a lot of the movie is enjoyable, I find you become numb to a lot of the action quicker than the creators would have liked. Nonetheless this movie has all my respect because of just how crazy and original it is, especially in a industry that loves to churn out safe, formulaic movies. This movie is not perfect by any means, but it's a jolly fun time that is worth a watch. Just don't expect to understand most of what's going on.

22 October 2022,MICHELLE YEOH'S BEST PERFORMANCE,"I must say out of all Michelle Yeoh's films that I have watched, this was her best portrayal to date. Not only did she embody a desperate protagonist very effectively, she also made it her own and very unforgettable. The style of direction and writing was not exactly my cup of tea but it was definitely interesting to watch. It was a fusion of comedy and sci-fi and drama and each has its own way of making it into the story in a sophisticated and creative way. It was almost impossible to categorize the movie. It was not only Michelle Yeoh that highlighted the story, it was also the supporting characters. This film was definitely one the year's bests.

22 March 2023,7/11 Oscars!,"Everything Everywhere All at Once:

After winning 7 oscars, I'm pretty sure its time I watch this. When an interdimensional rupture unravels reality, an unlikely hero, Evelyn, must channel her newfound powers to fight bizarre and bewildering dangers from the multiverse as the fate of the world hangs in the balance.

I really don't know why it took me too long to watch this, and I really regret it. Just like the title says, you het everything in this movie. The comedy, the action, the visuals, the acting, and many more, all with a budget of around 25 million dollars (compared to the 200 million for Thor: Love and Thunder). The movies script was so creative. The way the explored the multiverse and jumping through those multiverse was just amazing. The movie was also very fun to watch with all the fight scenes, the really good comedy, and the amazing effects. The Daniels (the directors of the movie) bring everything together in such a nice way and in everysingle frame.

The cast was superb. This is Michelle Yeoh's first big leading role, and she totally crushed it. Her acting was perfect and she felt like she was one with the character especially that she does all her stunts. So glad she won the Oscar, she really deserved it. I really liked Ke Huy Quan's (who plays Waymond, Evelyn's husband) performance, and he also won an Oscar for this role. Jamie Lee Curtis' character was really funny too but I don't think her performance was really Oscar worthy.

My only problem with this movie was that it could've been a bit shorter, but other than that, the movie was so fun and entertaining.

Score:9/10.",9
17 March 2023,Changing sense of DEI of the Academy,"The Academy Award 2023 was filled with the momentum of ""Everything Everywhere all at onece"". Not just the best leading and supporting actor and actress, but also the best director and the best film were dominated by this film. Over the past several years when the US film academy was criticized and accused of lacking sense of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, the academy continued effort to sit along with DEI. They suddenly appreciated Korean film ""Parasite"" and to my surprice, they began to value colored actors and actresses. As for ""Everything Everywhere all at once"", I think that they got too conscious about DEI to evaluate the genuine value of film itself. Many of critics said that ""Everything Everywhere all at once"" is something tough to figure out what it should say, because of its environment surrounded with multi-universe, which is the concept normally dealt in state of the art physics being really arcane to understand for normal spectators. As in the vision and creed of US film academy, comprehensibility of film might have been stated, ""Everything Everywhere all at once"" was sort of way-out. Even if the DEI shoud be weighed in, it looks apt to be out of fair valuation. How deep do you think the academy weigh in CEI for fair valuation of performances and contents?",6
29 May 2022,"Hilarious, Emotional Chaos","Absurd and chaotic, Everything Everywhere All at Once brilliantly combines insane comedy with brutal emotion and philosophical discovery.

It doesn't start off brilliantly though, as when at its most sane the plot is difficult to follow. The switching between languages, rushed speech and lack of audio clarity can make the dialogue very difficult to understand. It's very frustrating trying to keep up with the story and this continues in the early multiverse introduction. Only later do you appreciate that none of this particularly matters, the entire plot is impossible so enjoying the mania at face value is probably enough.

A synopsis cannot truly cover the ongoing across three acts, each scene progressively more zaney and inventive. Jumping between universes, scenes can be hilarious and immediately followed up by something deep and cutting. They all add something to the film, keeping it unpredictability and enjoyable throughout.

The visuals cover everything needed without going overboard on special effects, and props and costuming deliver on every occasion. The cast is superb, the largely Asian-American roster switching between personas excellently, and wonderfully supplemented by Curtis.

Not even the most famous 'Multiverse' film to be released in May 2022, but certainly the most unique and undeniably entertaining.",9
19 March 2023,Gimmick,"At first, that movie seems entertaining to look at, but it is a one-trick pony with not much substance. It is like talking about an idea over and over again with no outcome.

The actors do well, outfitting, film equipping and stage managing also do but well...but it goes on and on and on and on, nice idea here, funny gag there and then it ends.

And It leaves me with the feeling of betray. I expected it to be much more deep, I felt even entitled to get more out of this while watching.

This movie is pretentious but in the same time it is still likable.

Maybe, I'm just not able to vibe with the hype: Solid 6 out of 10.

5 February 2023,Don't trust the reviews,"I cannot understand why this movie got high reviews. It is overly strange but not in a good way. It's strange in a way that makes absolutely no sense. There's no good acting or effects. The story is almost non-existing. There is no cohesion and no characters that makes sense at all. It may have some famous characters or a famous director, I'm not sure. I recognized the main character only. It's like someone did a school project while doing drugs and ended with this weird but bad result. It's too far fetched even from an artistic point of view. I cannot recommend it no matter what preferences you may have.

15 January 2023,A Top Oscar Contender,"A24 has produced some of my favorite films, The Lighthouse, Moonlight, and Uncut Gems, to name a few. This year, in particular, has been great for the studio. Films like X, Aftersun, and the Whale make up your competition for award season. Then there's this film. The trailers looked interesting, but I skipped it when it came out. When they announced the nominees for the Golden Globes, I decided I should give this film a watch.

This film has a perfect cast. I know that might sound a bit of an exaggeration, but it's true. Michelle Yeoh is great as Evelyn. It's a protagonist that you want to root for. Yeoh deserved her golden globe win, but I believe she deserves an Oscar nomination. Yeoh's not the only cast member that deserves all the awards this season. Ke Huy Quan plays the husband, Waymond, and I loved the character from the get-go. Waymond in the home universe is an interesting character, but it Alpha-Waymond who steals the show. Huy Quan's versatility allows him to go from a loveable husband to a man trying to save the universe. When I first heard Huy Quan's voice, I thought, ""Where have I heard this voice before."" After a little investigation, I found my Data. No, actually, I found Data. Huy Quan is the Short Round from Indiana Jones and Data from the goonies. I love both characters and didn't even realize Huy Quan had retired over twenty years ago. I'm glad he came out of retirement because he should win an Oscar. Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu also deliver solid performances worthy of Oscar nominations. The film appears all over the place, and that's what makes it so wonderful. You never know where things are going; you're always guessing and trying to figure it out. I hope this film wins all the Oscars it's nominated for; it's that good.

10/10 One of the finest films released during 2022.",10
15 March 2023,A Combo of Great Movie Concepts Put Into One!!,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is everything that you have liked about sci-if movies for over the past 24 years done in a semi-realistic style! Starting with 1999's the Matrix, EEAAO as I will call Everything Everywhere All at Once for short for the purposes of this review, borrows greatly from some of the kung-fu fighting scenes that we saw in the Matrix! Now I know what you're thinking, you're thinking ""MIke, there's been kung-fu in many other movies especially Bruce Lee movies of decades earlier."" While that is true no film re-introduced kung-fu and other styles of Asian fighting like the trio of Matrix films did around the turn of the 2000's. EEAAO re-introduces kung-fu and other innovative fighting styles. I should point out that there is A LOT of fighting in EEAAO, you can see how Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies) won the Academy Award for best leading actress for all of the physical work she had to do in addition to her outstanding acting! The same compliment goes for this year's Academy Award winner for best supporting actor in Ke Huy Quan, once again outstanding physical acting for the fight scenes that he was in plus the emotional acting that he poured out on the silver screen. Ke Huy Quan (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) is a very versatile actor and I expect more from him in the years to come! Now to this great meta verse they discuss and experience at length in the movie. No doubts the Academy Award winning directors of the film Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert - two still very young men on the rise in the industry - have been influenced by the Avengers movies that came out not too long ago. As far as I know those were the first movies that really introduced main stream culture to a meta verse, a galaxy of multiple universes similar to this one happening now simultaneously with other universes that had small variations or something similar to it. With these meta verses jumping around throughout the movie they only intensify the action and significance of the relationships between the characters. You could tell that Jamie Lee Curtis had a lot of fun playing IRS agent Deirdre Beaubeidre so much so that she earned the Academy Award for best supporting actress for her work. All in all, EEAAO is a very dense movie but it is a lot of fun! Good directing, good writing, GREAT acting, good action, decent special effects, good humor, and a great sense of fun make this a great movie!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",8
17 April 2022,Go see this movie!,"It's Scott Pilgrim meets The Matrix, with a dash of Konty Python thrown in just for fun. But it's also a meditation on family and finding your place in the world, AND it's a feel good movie on top of that, meaning that you'll want to call your Mom and tell her you love her.

I wanted to watch it again as soon as it ended.

22 September 2022,Wonderful Madness,"Michelle Yeoh is one of my favourite actors. She's one of those rare gems who seems to care for the role she's playing and seeks out the unusual. She kinda reminds me of John Hurt in that regards.

As such I was looking forward to seeing this. I missed it at the theatres (curse you covid) so had to make do with renting on a streaming service.

I was not disappointed. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a fantastic film. One of the best I've seen in a long time. And it's so nice to come across something this isn't just some franchise mass produced, money grab content. I love my weird and wild adventures. This gives me hope that cinema isn't dead.

Probably my only complaint (and that might be because I've been mildly depressed for so many years now that I don't actually feel anything anymore) is that I felt there was too much focus on side concepts at times. I just feel like some ideas were awesome to begin with, but wore out their welcome after a while. And that if the film was a little tighter it would've popped more. As is, it's still fantastic and I will definitely add it to my DVD collection (yes I still buy DVDs/Blurays but they're reserved for my favourites)",8
28 July 2022,Everything Everywhere.. thrown in one big bowl and try to eat that soup,"Too much of everything. I couldn't take this movie not even as an improvise, parody, rehearsal, nothing. It had too many ideas and chaos that weren't really making sense. Too overrated for me. I liked some of the moves, but it wasn't enough. This seemed like a big budget Netflix movie, put them in one place and see what happens. I'm sorry, but this is a no for me.

10 April 2022,Nothing short of amazing,"Everything Everywhere All at Once, the latest offering from A24, is set to go down as one the most innovative, heartfelt, and nonsensical movies of the year. Starring Michelle Yeoh, the film follows Evelyn Wang, a woman who learns she has the power to exist in parallel universes tasked with stopping the person trying to destroy them all. Evelyn is feeling an increasing amount of pressure as she preps the paperwork for her and her husband's dry cleaning business to go through an audit while also prepping for a Chinese New Year party as well as dealing with her distant daughter. When an alternate version of Waymond appears to tell her the multiverse in trouble and she's the only one who can save it all, Evelyn is swept up in events beyond her control as she finds a way to save everything, everywhere, all at once.

While the premise may sound outlandish (because it is), at the heart of the movie is the generational trauma and interpersonal drama between the Wang family. Evelyn's rejection of her daughter's modern sensibilities, her ever-growing distance from her husband, a looming threat of suicide, and the baggage of any number of past decisions haunt the film from the first frame to the final one. All this is balanced deftly with the sci-fi elements of dimension hopping and universe-spanning adventures. The best science fiction is that which uses the genre trappings to tell a human story and directors Kwan and Scheinert have managed to weave a story that is exactly that. Is the science part of the movie a bit wonky and hand-wavy? Absolutely. But using it to tell the tale of a family on the verge of shattering that is funny, shocking, emotional, and impactful while also finding clever ways to pay homage to classic movies like 2001 and In the Mood for Love makes Everything Everywhere one of the year's best movies.

Michelle Yeoh finally found a vehicle where she could let her talents fly, and fly they do. Without a doubt, Everything Everywhere is firmly her film; all the elements and themes flow through Evelyn Wang and directors Kwan and Scheinert have given her avenues to show both her comedic and dramatic chops. While we've seen these before (think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or her role on Star Trek: Discovery), it's rare we get to see such a substantial amount of both at the same time. Her martial arts acumen is well documented; seeing that combined with the dizzying array of other gifts she presents here reminds us that Yeoh has been a consummate performer for three decades and while there isn't a weak link in the acting in this film, no one else is holding a candle to her.

Stephanie Hsu comes pretty close, however. While Yeoh is the film's main focus, Hsu's Joy is handling a lot of the subtle work throughout the film. In a movie that can only be described as ostentatious, Hsu's muted performance makes Joy one of the standout characters. Carrying the brunt of the film's anguish, Hsu is marvelous as she traverses through makeup and costumes as both Joy and the antagonist Jobu Tupaki, the person willing to burn it all down. Hsu and Yeoh's chemistry is electric as the two play off each other, ending in an aching moment of emotional catharsis that is equal parts relief and revelatory. Yeoh and Hsu sell these final moments, the crux of the entire movie, and thanks to their performances, the film rockets from good to great.

Ke Huy Quan, better known to some as Data from the Goonies or Short Round from Indiana Jones, has less to do in the movie than Yeoh or Hsu but is no less important. A main part of the cause of the breaking family that is the Wangs, Quan's Waymond is the paragon of hope and optimism. Contrasted to Evelyn's depressed where-did-it-all-go-wrong mentality, Waymond's ebullience is both infectious and nauseating. While both Evelyn and Joy get multiple opportunities to shine, Waymond gets one great scene with Eveyln towards the end of the film that makes his character's entire trajectory worthwhile. Jamie Lee Curtis appears throughout the film as well as Deirdre, the IRS inspector set to take all that the Wangs hold dear. As a constant antagonist through the film, Curtis is great in her I-could-really-give-a-shit demeanor as a woman who's just doing her job, albeit at the expense of the Wang's livelihood. While the Wangs are the centerpiece of the movie, Curtis manages to compliment them in every scene she's in. James Hong, in less scenes than Curtis, is a delight to see as always as Evelyn's dad and brings a sorely needed gravitas to his scenes that are necessary to keeping the movie anchored.

Directed by The Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert), Everything Everywhere is a follow up to their equally inventive Swiss Army Man. Whereas Swiss Army Man presents a more surrealist type of story, Everything Everywhere pushes the envelope even father in terms of inventiveness and creativeness. The main strength of the film, and in The Daniels' storytelling, is the focus on the main issue: a dysfunctional family. Regardless of every bit of nonsense the directors throw at the audience, from our characters portrayed as rocks to a world where everyone has hot dogs for fingers, the story always reverts back to the Wang family and their interconnected struggles. Technically, Everything Everywhere is a masterpiece, managing to consistently shift through genres without losing sight of the objective. Be it the brilliant makeup Hsu's Joy is decked out in or her outlandish costume designs, the level of detail that went into creating the film reveals how well thought out and meticulous The Daniels and their crew are.

Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once will go down as one of the most impressive displays of creativity and imagination on screen. Daniels Kwan and Scheinert's ability to pull off a zany, darkly comedic sci-fi movie while interweaving a poignant family drama is nothing short of amazing. By far Michelle Yeoh's best role to date (as well as Stephanie Hsu's), Everything Everywhere shines a dazzling spotlight on the actress' myriad talents and specialties. An outrageously inventive premise, combined with strong acting and brilliant direction makes this a phones down, all senses dialed in must watch immediately.",9
28 May 2022,A contradiction of a movie,"Bear in mind I normally hate sci fi......

It more than passed the 6 (or 10) laugh test. I kinda loved it at times and at other times I was bored. Crappy but great. Deep but shallow. Ridiculously stupid but genius. Mind numbing but thought provoking. A contradiction of a film. I kinda hated it and kinda loved it. The best sci-fi movie I've seen for years. 7 out of ten.

11 October 2022,Thank God for something fresh,"Inventive. Unique. Creative. Bold.

Also over the top. Repetitive. Bloated. Silly.

Hard to tell at times whether it's a work of pure genius or genre blending abursdity.

It's neither. It's a mix of both. Mostly on the smart side. And it's mostly fun.

Definitely different which in today's safe cinematic world of proven brands in the way of endless sequels, spinoffs, reboots and remakes is an absolute godsend. It deserves an Academy award for Originality.

Sadly the Oscar's are now only about virtue posturing and not quality filmmaking.

One thing is for certain, any film over 2 hours better have a damn good reason for doing so. This type of film would be far better served being under that benchmark.

The first hour particularly, is quite repetitive and would have made a much better and more enjoyable experience if it were more concise. The second half works much better but still it is over long and ultimately damages the film as a whole.

Still very enjoyable and quite funny. It just doesn't always hit the mark and can be tiring at times. In others, it really is impressive.

Great acting chops for all the leads. Jamie Lee Curtis was a riot. Great to see Short Round back too. His character actually had a lot of charisma and it's a real shame he hasn't been on screen as much in recent decades as he really lights it up every time he opens his mouth.

Kudos to the filmmakers. I especially love the rocks sequence. Better performances than most Hollywood tossers.",7
6 September 2023,Criminally Overrated,"I watched this movie, based on the hype surrounding it, expecting something nothing short of a blockbuster. This movie is filled with lame characters, muddled storyline, and nauseating directing from someone borrowing heavily from other well known (and competent) directors. Michelle Yeoh had a decent performance with whatever it was she was trying to portray, everyone else seemed like a blur in a sea of garbage throughout the movies 2 hour 19 min run time. Some commenter put ""don't do drugs, watch this movie instead."" Id have to say that's probably the most cringiest comment of 2022 on this dumpster fire of a movie. 0/10.

18 September 2022,Crazy ride of Multiverse!,"Everything Everywhere All At Once succeeds where even brand Marvel fails: the concept of Multiverse.

This requires a right level of ambition and high amount of craziness. A formula which Hollywood couldn't decode, until now.

The writer-director knows what they want and also knows what they want audience to experience, right from the first frame.

Be it the mundane life of the main character or John Wick-style martial arts.

Everyone in the movie is connected, so you don't feel even a second wasted.

I believe this is more than enough for you to give this movie a chance.

Sit back and enjoy the ride.",8
4 February 2023,Great,"This is a movie that is hard to explain but not hard to understand. In my opinion, those are the best movies that give you spectacle but also make you feel something. Every actor in this deserves acknowledged for the hard work they did, right alongside the film makers themselves. The only sad thing about this film is that we will probably never get another movie like it. I will just ha c e to continue to watch it over and over again as it gets better with each view. You get to see things here that we have never seen on the big screen. Couple that with incredible story telling and it is a hit for sure.

6 April 2023,Hilarious. Honest. Heartfelt.,"I'm convinced that anyone who is violently upset about this movie is incapable of paying attention, self reflecting, and having fun. Anyone who says it's ""overhyped"" must live a miserable existence, because this movie is truly a work of art.

It's smart, it's action-packed, it's dramatic, it's funny - and yes, even goofy at times. It's very rare that a film will make you cackle with laughter and cry - not because its content is devastating, but because the story itself is so beautiful, wild and relatable.

The whole cast has great comedic timing while also pulling at the heartstrings. Stephanie Hsu is simply phenomenal in her role; Michelle Yeoh provides a realistic and entertaining portrayal of a mother navigating her relationship with her daughter; Ke Huy Quan's delivery is always charming; Jamie Lee Curtis does great as a supporting actress - and special shout-out to costume designer Shirley Kurata for her incredible mind.

This movie touches on strained family dynamics, existentialism, queerness, absurdism, all wrapped up in an everything bagel. I've introduced it to different friends many times since it came out and everyone has loved it in some way or another.

So if you're one of the few who just ""don't get it"", maybe keep it to yourself and stick to your predictable Marvel movies.",10
15 May 2022,Just wow,"This movie is a masterpiece. Layered, funny, complex script performed by an amazing cast. The costumes, effects and comedy were fantastic. I was so incredibly satisfied at the end. Please see it, and take someone you love.

15 July 2022,Eh,"Liked it more than I disliked it but it was too long 6/10. Movie could of been an hour shorter and it would have been better for it.

Not sure why everyone is raving about originality, the movie is an edgy take on It's a Wonderful Life with violence and depravity (if you know you know).

All in all I don't think I'm going to be recommending it, there were a couple of times I thought I was gonna turn it off out of boredom.

Best view scenario: You're sick or bad weather cancelled your plans and you don't know what to do with yourself. Some mindless entertainment with a surprisingly wholesome message.

12 June 2022,Great ... to a point.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",7
8 April 2022,This film is *INCREDIBLE.*,"I felt... all of the feelings.

All of them. Often at the same time (or at least in varying combinations).

This film deserves to win Best Picture and Michelle Yeoh deserves an Oscar (which she's not gonna get...)

...but we can imagine the universe where she does. And that universe, like this film, is beyond lovely.

27 June 2022,"Bagel, hotdog fingers whatever all at once.","A Chinese immigrant discovered the possibility of connecting with other universes and use her abilities in these universes to save the world as her ""alpha univers"" husband claims to be the chosen one for this mission .

This film is an example of how good reviews and high expectations can ruin the experience.

For me this film is adopting a new idea and create a big mess, the multiverse principles in this movie are very interesting very creative to be honest but the execution is messy in a weird way.

I'm still asking myself what is special about it, and the only answer is the directing, a decent cinematography, colors and costume designs...every frame was visually stunning.

Turning those creepy ideas into an actual film isn't that easy, that's why I'm appreciating the technical stuff and their efforts.

But, it can't be enough, it's other missed opportunity about the multiverse.",6
14 February 2023,"Comparing to PARASITE, yes this movie is indeed overly hyped and rated","People usually say, ""overhyped"" or ""overrated"" if a movie doesn't live up to a fame. Sometimes it's agreeable, but oftentimes it's hard to agree with them because many claims with baseless information like the one with Titanic. How many people can really agree with someone saying ""Titanic is overrated""? Well, today I'll make a point of why Everything Everywhere All at Once is overrated with a nutshell information by comparing with the move, Parasite. When Parasite was getting popular in US, I was thinking, ""it's probably because it's leveraged by a social trend"". However, ""Boy, was I wrong"" that's what I said right after watching the movie. I could understand why it gained so much popularity. The movie is well scripted and well directed, but most of all, it's a movie that nobody has ever seen before which is probably why the movie received a big applauds and awards at Cannes and others. It's understandable completely that Parasite is definitely not overrated. However, in case of Everything Everywhere All at Once, it's also well scripted and well directed, but the plot and EVERYTHING in this movie is something I've seen in many movies and TV shows over and over especially with multiverse and the family dynamics. There's ZERO wonder why it didn't get any attention from Cannes, and the movie is basically unknown in other countries except US. The movie's fame is only leveraged by the social trend only in US. I can expect this movie will grab a lot of Oscars, and also can expect this movie will easily be forgotten unlike Parasite.

*Keep in mind that I'm not a diehard fan of Parasite. I do like the movie, but I'm only using it because it makes a good comparison with Everything Everywhere All at Once especially with Cannes award.",1

14 April 2022,"Stop asking ""What If""","I've never left a theatre so desperate to rewatch something as I did with Everything Everywhere All at Once. From the very first scene, right the way through to the end - Everything Everywhere All at Once is an assault on the senses in all the best ways. It's quite hard to know where to begin; after all, this is a movie about everything, everywhere, all at once.

Let's start with the story; this is a movie about Evelyn, and the relationships she has with her husband, her daughter, her father, and most importantly - herself. You see; Evelyn is a woman constantly asking ""what if..."". What if she'd been a doctor? Or not moved to the USA? What if she'd been more than she is? I guess this doesn't really explain the story at all, but I don't really want to spoil the magic for you. This is a movie about Evelyn, and how she finally learns to love the life she has. Of course, this is a significant oversimplification.

Moving on; this movie is a visual treat. The visual effects range from the fantastic to the basic. There's everything from well-choreographed fight scenes (including a very memorable fight where the weapon of choice is a fanny pack), right the way through to a hilariously under-puppeted raccoon. The jarring contrast between the hyperreal and the clearly-fake could've come across as crude, if not unprofessional in any other film. Here, though, it's a well-executed mishmash that works because it's part of a larger collage of pictures equally out of place.

I think the other think that helps meld these two disparate styles together is the fact that, beneath it all, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a comedy film. It's easy to focus on the more sentimental aspects of the movie, especially given the main theme of ""acceptance"", but it'd be a genuine disservice not to acknowledge the movie as a comedy. From malapropisms, to Michelle Yeohs' excellent delivery - this movie is one of those laugh-a-minute types that never quite gets old. Leaning heavily into the absurd, you can never quite anticipate what might come next. Clearly, absurdist humour isn't for everyone, and there'll be more than a few people who come away from it with a bitter taste in their mouth. However, in my opinion, Everything Everywhere All at Once does a fantastic job of delivering risqu√© jokes without ever delving quite into pure vulgarity. It is, of course, this same absurdity that manages to carry some of the films more tender moments. On paper, two rocks conversing mightn't be the most riveting of ideas; but Everything Everywhere All at Once manages to sell this concept with gusto - to the point where the theatre I was in was loud with laughter most at this point in the movie. Indeed, this is the kind of movie that has you connecting emotionally with two rocks. This, though, isn't the most absurd moment in the film, but to delve too much further would do nothing but dip into spoilers. All I can say is; this doesn't feel like absurdity for absurdities sake. A lot of the time, absurdist comedy can come off very - ""hAhA iM SO random RAWR xD"". Here, though, it feels much more in service of the point the film was trying to drive home.

Ultimately, I really could sit here and praise this film for hours.

I guess if I had to criticise any aspect, it'd be the world building, which felt a little thin at times, but once I stopped questioning things, and simply watched it for what it was; I found those complaints dissipate. If you watch Everything Everywhere All at Once with an open mind; you can't go wrong. I can't wait to see it again, and you bet I'll be buying the blu-ray the moment it's on sale.

10 May 2022,Interesting story,"I was drawn into the story at soon as the movie start. It does take you on a crazy ride but the message is simply the love between a mother and her daughter and it seems to be a metaphor to represent it.

The cinematography was very well done as well as the acting.

I saw it in a regular cinema and was very bothered by the switch of aspect ration from 1.35 to 2.39.

It's like watching a trailer for almost two hours.

Similar to what Christopher Nolan did with the dark night.

10 May 2022,More than meets the universes,"Bit overlong, but trippy weird fun. Leaves a big impression on you in some way or another. Solid performances and lots of interesting concepts and bizarre senses of humour. Nice emotional story giving multiverses a theme of purpose.

19 May 2022,A well orchestrated mess,"Interesting: so many 1 and 10-star reviews... but it's not perfect or terrible imo. The great part is the production, which is interesting but waaaaay too fast for old people. It's a good story, but oddly ""king fu scifi"" which is a bit of a turnoff for me (as a scifi lover) and for people who would enjoy the movie more without the fighting, which didn't seem like a natural fit for the plot. But it's Michelle Yeoh so...

Not much needs to be said with all these reviews digging in to details- I'll just add that the reasons people gave it 1 star seemed to have a personal problem with it, especially its style and ideas coming from the Matrix and other movies. Yes, so it's not a completely unique or original story, but that doesn't make it bad. That's just kind of how storytelling works : )

12 April 2022,Still processing the fact that I have a new favourite film,"If you're like me, you maybe have had a handful of favourite movies in your life, and you hold them tight and close like little personal treasures. It can be hard to demote a film to ""second favourite,"" especially if it's held the #1 spot for some time, but every so often you see something that challenges for that title. I seriously doubt that I'm the only one who has found a new favourite movie after this experience.

I do very much mean experience, too. EEAAO will have you laughing, crying, and laughing again on repeat for more than two hours. Every genre imaginable fits perfectly and purposefully into the film, and you never feel like the plot has left you behind. The story pulled me through from start to finish as light speed and left me feeling a mix of sonder and joy.

As a clear early front runner for next year's Best Picture (sorry, Dune 2), this movie will make you feel something, everything, everywhere, all at once. Go with a friend, go by yourself, go as many times as you damn well please because nothing matters. Just see this movie.",10
20 May 2022,"Kung Fu is in everything, even Cookies","I saw this Sci-Fi Kung-Fu Comedy last night and enjoyed it.

The humour is a quite deadpan but I laughed out loud a few times.

Its well made, well acted, visually very interesting and fun to watch. This is certainly not a huge budget blockbuster. It sits more within a decent budget indie film.

The Chinese elements of the film ring true in terms of family and tradition and it would seem the idea was to give it all a bit of s slap around the chops. ( With a dildo ?.)

Some of the ideas used are truly absurd and silly which may be too much for certain audiences whereas others will revel in them.

I was somewhere poised in the middle thinking "" well thats new "".

There are however deeper meanings to the movie to ponder and the issues sit real and are presented with integrity even if they are not world changing ideologies they are certainly relatable.

The science presented in this film is not to be taken seriously so try not to take it as so.

Overall this was a fun and enjoyable Chinese centric romp about family choices and destiny.",7
25 May 2022,All these ridiculous Low raters lol,"If you check all the 1 Ratings reviewers at least 75% of them has only reviewed 1-2 things ever, kinda makes u suspicious if its the same person lol Anyone to rate this below a 5 is insane and has no idea how to rate movies/shows.

Rating a 1-5 is like those D Lister movies with poor filming crews n terrible camera quality and middle school style CGI.

The lowest you should ever be able to rate a movie of this video quality, acting quality , creativity, CGI quality should be a 6 .

If people rate this a 1-5 then what they rating movies like Anaconda sequels ? Or any Mockbuster movies thats a low budget version of a big name production movie ?

This Movie was kinda confusing here and there but when you reach the end it kinda hit me that this movie can be a metaphor for multiple things related too Real Life and a very good one. It was well directed with amazing Marvel movies style CGI quality and great acting with some nice fight scenes. It might seem very random of things occurring as you watch this movie but everything connects in the end and the creativity was amazing.",10
27 June 2022,I Need to Marinate on This One...,"I wanted to like the movie a tiny bit more than I did. I do think it was a bit long, little hallmark-y with certain elements. The amount of work this movie called for is absolutely almost unfathomable.

A lot to think about here. I definitely loved how surprised I constantly was, I think everything was incredibly polished: from music to choreography.

Here is the moral of the story: I certainly wouldn't mind to seeing a bit more of this originality in media, no matter your thoughts on the movie, this project was a labor of love.

I'm a bit surprised that the weirdness factor was cranked waay up and for this to get pretty widespread acclaim.

Let's keep this originality and high level of polish with future films, I would tune in.",7
24 March 2023,Horrible rubbish,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

14 May 2022,"Our collective imagination in a movie - hilarious, action back and beautifully told","From start to finish this was nothing short but a modern day masterpiece, albeit very silly kind of humor that may not appeal to everyone or not be your thang depending on how you are feeling on the day. For me though, this movie had everything. Fast paced, intellectual, creatively shot, intricate story line with excellently choreographed action scenes and witty very very funny throughout. The best thing was that the story line all hangs together and comes together beautifully to bring an overall much deeper meaning to the entire premise of the movie. It's about human nature, life itself, what makes us who we are - our collective curiosity, magnificence, darkness, all rolled into one. It's a feel good movie that makes you want to see the bigger picture and not sweat the small stuff anymore. This movie will be watched again and stick with me for a long time. I'll always be trying to imagine what in the universe is install for all of us next ! Go watch this !

18 May 2022,"In 30 years the humanity moved from ""nothing else matters"" to ""nothing matters""","The movie is in its own cathegory, therefore no rating should apply. Compare it with classical movies, it is nothing, gets a 1... Compare it with modern martial arts movies, it is brilliantly reverting to martial arts essence and gets an 8... Compare it with revolutionary Sci Fi franchises, like The Matrix, it is an upgraded version, that is and is not new in the same time - not sure what rating applies.

The thing is this movie is a bit of every of the above, and others more, therefore should probably be rewatched, and what glues it together and allows a possible rating would be the note that is most constant in the aftertaste, repeatedly, and its value within that cathegory, if it is not one completely devoid of competition. The producers have however mentioned Rick and Morty, and there are other movies concerning multiverses, or game universes, so maybe it is a cathegory in the making, being populated as we speak.

What can I say, without rewatching?

*for the moment I do not know if I even want to rewatch it, the feeling can be described as sort of a brain hangover *it aims to help with some of the disaster felt by young generations, like giving instructions on how to deal with chaos better, because chaos itself ain't gonna be solved soon *it provides similar help for older generations that served as a bridge towards what is going on, although in the story, it was their fault for rushing things and in fact they are the ones who caused chaos and all the pressure the young have today *it feels more like a family centered drama, or a generations centered one, than a Sci Fi *could have skipped the sex-related elements, but I guess they are sending a message for all those who went to this extreme in their quest for meaning and purpose, or just for effing feeling something again in what they perceive as a world devoid of sensorial stimuli *brilliant reintroduction of martial arts, after the mess made by all the commercial movies depicting them - martial arts are NOT originally sports, but energy manipulation, triggering physical effects *lots of concepts from India and Asia mythology and spirituality, weirdly unexplained - I saw interviews where the movie team claims certain names, visuals and gestures are just gamified, jokes or creative randomness - why do they lie?! Mythological motifs of chaos and certain entities that rule it, or generate it, abund, and the movie's elements can be traced back to some of these. And it does not just happen, because they have details - the way Jobu steps aside her mother's head on the stairs, in closeup, is a reminder of how Kali stopped in her destruction after stepping with her right foot above her husband... but I am not completely familiar with these motifs to be able to understand exactly how they used them.. Just noticing they are in the movie, and not ""by chance"". Also the Indian movie playing on the screen, I would have to know what movie or story is that, to understand a bit... so, more things to find out. Maybe they claim randomness because the young would turn away from ""we're repacked for your understanding some very very old things"" - maybe... *someone here concluded that the message is ""set aside what could have been, and just strive to be happy with what you have, even modest"". I think not! There is a complicated explanation in the movie of why this Evelyn is the one needed to solve her daughter's entanglement with the chaos, and it is completely different. I am making an effort here, but by abandoning one dream after another, this Evelyn lives her ""failure"" version of a life with her eyes wide open, making herself available to see it all from the outside, being herself mobile in concepts and strong when it comes to aknowledge other versions exist. She is un-lodged in one type of life, non attached or less attached to a fixated truth, as her better more successful versions are, therefore open to seeing the possibilities and able to understand her daughter's story *the message IS an empowering one, although hard to pin down; what do you do when there is nothing stable, secure, predetemined and calming around? And it is a fact, beyond the bull*it of ""you are just troubled because you have to change the way you think"" psychanalytic mantra... what do you do when the world is bluntly going down the drain, as you used to know it? What do you hold on to? The movie wants to help with getting an answer, which could be, I imagine, understood by each viewer in its own way.",
10 July 2022,the worst kind of good movie,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a family movie (not family in the prurient PG sense, but in that the movie is about family).

Creative, zany, brilliant in the 1st act. An hour-and-a-half of ridiculous, laughable, juvenile hi-jinks with solid philosophical backing. The last 45 minutes are a redundant bore.

The best movies are ones you can relish repeatedly, that improve with multiple viewings because of details that enrich the context, and you can appreciate how well the story hangs together (even when it might not seem so on the first viewing). The title Everything Everywhere All At Once fits the content, in that you get it all in a single viewing, and there's no reason to see it again.

14 March 2023,A movie worth a second rewatch,"It is a great movie with great cast team. The story about a mother who struggling paying taxes in one of her multiverse. The term ""multiverse"" is one that is often associated with the genre of science fiction, where it denotes the existence of an infinite number of parallel universes, each one branching out from every decision we make. Whether we choose to enter into marriage or not, or embark on a journey to one country instead of another, each choice can lead to a myriad of diverse experiences and interactions with different people, ultimately resulting in the creation of a distinct universe. While every individual has their own unique multiverse, the ability to transition between these alternate realities remains elusive. The film in question depicts the emotional journey of a mother whose profound love for her daughter drives her to explore the latter's ability to move between multiple realities within her multiverse.

29 November 2022,"What if ""Rick & Morty"" and ""Matrix"" had a child?","I didn't know anything about this movie at all, just found it and watched it, so I wasn't hyped at all.

Can't deny the visual work is very good, costumes, scenarios, special effects, etc. But it's excessively ridiculous, to the point it feels more like a long YouTube meme video but a movie.

Most ideas were already used in Rick & Morty, and the baseline of the movie is Matrix. The beginning of the movie was pretty interesting, but after 1 hour it became boring and repetitive.

It's been a long time since I felt this way watching a film and wanting it just to end. This is a perfect example of how a good idea can turn into a waste. I really wanted to like this film but unfortunately I felt frustrated, irritated, disgusted and bored all at once. I even made an account on this site to rate it lol

Of course it is worth to watch, there are really worst movies out there, but this is not what people are praising it to be. If you like this genre, just watch Rick & Morty, or even The Midnight Gospel.",6
17 April 2022,Randomness Weaves a Web Between This Movie and Us,"Just to get this down somewhere so others who have seen the movie will understand... The morning before we saw this movie was the Saturday before Easter. Our girls, both about the age of the daughter in the movie, were decorating Easter eggs. One of them got the idea to put GOOGLIE EYES on some of them. Earlier in the day, I was filing an amended TAX RETURN, while my wife was doing a lot of LAUNDRY, mostly for our youngest, who came home from college for the Easter holiday. For breakfast, my wife offered our youngest a BAGEL, but she opted for something else.

We then saw the movie not realizing in advance any connection to it and the above seemingly trivial events from earlier in the day. For those who saw the movie, I am sure you can see the connection....and it has us amazed. Yes, apparent random events in our lives can, by coincidence, also show up in movies we see.....but for this movie?...given its objective and that our trivial events happened within our family? Something is going on here! (I changed my rating from a 9 to a 10 because of this insight---see yeah, it's a 10 for me purely for personal reasons given the course of events that led up to seeing the movie)

If randomness *weaves* a web of events, is anything truly random?

For the movie itself, one reviewer elsewhere suggested you 'strap in' and hang on. This movie is a wild ride successfully attempting to give significance to our own seemingly trivial lives if only for a few brief moments in this one particular universe. In the end...be kind.",10
7 March 2023,What's the hype for?,"I mean seriously? What's the hype for? What are they winning awards for?

I so desperately tried to watch this movie with diligence, patience and an open mind. I so desperately wanted to love this movie. But it's sad that I didn't even like it.

Did I watch the same movie as everyone else? Because it's so hyped. Omg. I cannot believe it.

I went back to the movie and tried to see what others could. But I fail. The story is fine. The acting is fine. The costumes are amazing. The direction is below par and the editing ughh. So what was great about this movie guys? Please someone explain it to me.

3 May 2022,Quite unbearable to watch,"On the positive side you have Michelle Yeoh who is a great actress and the two directors have some funny and original ideas. But it becomes pretty unbearable to watch as they keep on repeating the same ideas and visuals again and again. A bit surprised by the overwhelming positive reviews.

5 January 2023,An unexpected masterpiece.,"People who jokingly call cinema ""Kino"" often wait on releases by the likes of the Von Triers and Gaspar Noe of this world to be ""wowed"" by their next masterpiece, give it a 10, and go to wait again.

Rarely do a movie surprise you in a way that is so unexpected, so cleverly delivered and so beautifully written and directed that it immediately puts its creator on the maps of ""those to watch"" - Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheninert somehow captured lighting and delivered it in movie format, ignoring all conventions, mixing all genres, unhindered by convention.

While the movie is evidently not perfect (the lead 'villain' would probably have been better interpreted by the protagonist, and they know it), it's a masterpiece in its own right. What differentiates this movie from say, a movie like ""the matrix"" is that it's as profound as any, say, Dogme 95 film while keeping the fantastic imagery top notch throughout.

The movie reminded me so much of ""mother!"" by Aronofsky, it had some big shoes to fill indeed and filled them very well. Outside a few ""oh-hum"" over the top vfx shot, EEAaO is powerful throughout its three chapter and paced to perfection.

Probably the best surprise of the year, and a must watch for ... anyone really. True to its title, the movie has something for everyone, everywhere.",10
13 June 2022,"Messy, ridiculous, stupid and perfect???","Everything Everywhere All At Once, the perfect name for this crazy movie.

One of the most original things you'll see in your life.

Even if you don't want to go too deep into it's meaning you'll have a lot of fun.

The movie feels like a videogame, the first 20 minutes of the movie are some kind of tutorial, the rules are explained and once you get everything you'll flow with the action.

What a ride, you'll laugh and the ending if a bit predictable will still make you shed some tears.

I laughed (especially at Jamie Lee Curtis' character. I didn't recognise her at first. Brilliant.), I cried, I felt like I'd been through a spiritual experience. It's great. Just watch it.

17 March 2023,I'm noticing a strange trend...,"It seems that many of the one star reviews of this film are coming out around the time this film got Oscar buzz and after it won best picture. Not to suggest that that is the case with every single review, but it just feels a little odd, doesn't it? Not only that but a lot of the criticism towards this film is centred around the Oscars that the film won. ""The acting is garbage"" or ""the writing is nonsensical"" and other similar phrases. Now I'm not saying that you need to love this film, but I am suggesting that people should give this film a fair chance to stand on its own rather than hating on it because it has reached the peak of mainstream film attention.

But how exactly do I feel about this film? I think it's wonderful! I saw this film before any announcements about the Oscar nominations and before I even began thinking about my Oscar picks, so just know my actual review portion of this review isn't just an over exaggeration of a 7/10 review to bump the score up but just my honest opinion.

The first time I saw it I thought it was great and absurd. After my second time watching it I understood more of what the film was saying. I've now seen the movie 4 times and it keeps getting better every time. Emotional performances from Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Kwan as well as the amazing writing from Daniels help to make them feel like real people. I can understand how a lot of the absurdist comedy might not be for everyone. Even the people I know who love this film have a few criticisms with its implementation, but in my opinion it suits the film very well and works with how the story is told and surprisingly doesn't feel unnecessarily forced. The film is just in general very funny and is also one of few movies where I get emotional every time I watch it.

The film is a heartfelt journey through love and family contained within an absurd LSD fueled trip through the universe. It might not be for everyone but I consider this one of my favourite films and definitely the best picture of 2022.",10
30 April 2022,Way too long,"The biggest flaw of the movie is that it drags for so long becoming repetitive and always following the same narrative over and over. 1h45 would be ideal.

3 February 2023,Rick & Morty has nothing on this,"Everything Everywhere All at Once could be described as a movie about relationships (mother-daughter, wife-husband, daughter-father), or it could be described as an attempt to find meaning in one's life against the struggles of existence. It could be described as an exploration of choices and whether we meet our potential, or it could be described as a look at the immigrant experience. It could even be described as an epic multiverse-traversing hero's quest against an evil force threatening to destroy reality.

This movie is incredibly energetic, with rarely lull in action or story. The most impressive thing about the film is how it's able to take on so much without getting repetitive or tiresome. It could have collapsed into the singularity of its own premise, or just gotten so silly that the sincere moments were lost, but instead we're left with an experience that's funny, sad, incisive, nonsensical, poignant, thrilling, provocative, and a whole lot more on this Everything Bagel of a film. This film has to be seen to be believed!

5 March 2023,There's a fine line between ambitiously bizarre and simply dopey,"And this film sits perilously close to falling on the wrong side of that line.

First of all, Michelle Yeoh is worth every moment she is on screen. Easily the best part of the film, she is spectacular in every scene, with every motion, in every universe she inhabits. Truly a magnificent performance. Ke Huy Quan is also strong in a mostly meek, often comic, role. Beyond that, well, it's a lot of overwrought emotion and bad martial art set pieces. Not a particular fan of sci-fi or martial arts films myself, I can only surmise that the slo-mo and sped-up fight scenes could not possibly represent state of the art technology, as it was more cartoonish than action packed.

Given this kind of science fiction film, with its unabashedly childish conception of what the constitutes a 'multiverse', a significant heap of suspension of disbelief is required. But even at that, the weirdness-for-weirdness sake (which the film freely acknowledges) just kind of falls flat. Even as the film shares a wink with the audience at its own absurdity, the humor plays more as mitigating audience expectations. As if to say 'we're really just joking about his schlock'. And after it all, the message is essentially the same as you get in reading Kurt Vonnegut, but with fewer laughs.

I would absolutely recommend for anyone who wants to see Michelle Yeoh in a beautiful performance. She is absolutely a treasure in this role. For story, stunts or special effects, not so much.",6
4 August 2023,Awful,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

27 January 2023,This is a wuxia film in disguise,"I started watching this thinking this was going to be one of those melancholy nonsensical ""arthouse"" science fiction dramas. Boy was I wrong. This is a wuxia film in disguise (if you don't know what wuxia is: think Jackie Chan).

It's action-packed, hilarious, and insanely absurd. Genuinely funny. Like one moment I'm laughing at something, and then it becomes even more ridiculous, and then EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS. Like fever-dream ridiculous.

It also reminds me of Scott Pilgrim vs The World. Same campiness of the humor and similarly action-packed.

Underneath it all is also a story about generational divides in immigrant families. Filial piety. Acceptance. Marriage. With the central themese being nihilism and the ""what ifs"" that we all think about.",10
8 July 2022,Everything on a bagel,"This movie has a great mix of drama, action, and comedy! This is what movies should be like. Entertaining on many levels, with depth, character development, a lot of randomness, and laughs. I highly recommend seeing this!

27 June 2022,Return to art,"With the recent oversaturation of Marvel Movies, that I'd hardly consider art (as In no real deep telling of a story, using filmography to tell said story etc.) I think this is a good sign for a return to the idea that Films are in-fact an Artform.

I haven't laughed and cried as much over this movie than I have over any other one.

I went into this thinking it was some goofy action/comedy and the first 2/3 of the movie are mostly that, but the last 40 minutes or so, I was constantly in tears.

I wish I could honestly experience this movie all over again, with no prior knowledge of the story and what happens near the end, I'd say its one of the most sweetest and ""emotionally realistic"" endings I've ever seen to a film.

28 April 2022,I liked it. However this movie has some nasty issue with pacing.,"This movie is quite wild. And, overall, it's only flaw is the kind of pacing that tires watchers out.

It's something more or less like this: 20 minutes of slow 20 minutes of non-stop action 30 minutes of action with small breaks 30 minutes of mostly nothing with some action breaks

Action is great, but when the movie slows to ""lets talk"" part.. it gets tiresome, because it either doesn't end or the topic is eye-rolling'ly lame.

The final message is strong, but because of the pacing i felt simply tired to really care and think about it. So i just accepted it as is, while rushing out of cinema.

Humor is mostly good, there were some scenes i openly laughed. For all the runtime my focus never waned, so that's good.

Should you watch it: If you like Rick and Morty, this show will most likely feel familiar and fun. If you like ""weird"" movies, then this one should also be fun experience.",7

It's not.

It's a comedy. Fun. But if I never see it again I won't mind.

13 June 2022,Cinema Omnivore - Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) 8.2/10,"""All hell breaks loose in the IRS building, Evelyn the launderette has no sooner disabused incredulity than minions of Jobu Tapaki start their offensive. Levity bursts out every time when a character must do something utterly ridiculous to acquire a particular skill belonging to their counterpart in another universe, for instance, ""butt-hurt"" has a literal signification here. The universes imagineered by Daniels range from small variations like Evelyn the movie star, or the martial artist, or the opera singer, to absolute bonkers, like Evelyn and Deirdre become a lesbian couple in a universe where human's fingers are supplanted by hot dogs, or Evelyn is a teppanyaki chef and her younger colleague Chad (Shum Jr., a droll eye-candy!) is puppeteered by a Ratatouille-like raccoon, to the utter abstract, eons later, humans have devolved into stones.""

4 July 2022,The best quality of this film is ignoring every genre convention.,"In general though I think the sum of its parts is greater than the whole. I do admire it's fearlessness and willingness to put on the screen anything that seems to pop into their head sort of like a stream of consciousness film making. At times it makes for a very entertaining watch but it relentlessly keeps you in sort of a confused state that sometimes I think is a bit too much. I recommend this film for its uniqueness and I think there will probably be other films that are inspired by this and try to imitate it in the future.

I'm giving up on these films, same as French Dispatch, rubbish. I cannot work out what it was about and why I paid $20 to watch it.

10 June 2022,"Be Kind, you don't Know Everything","Out of all the universes where we could be anything, be kind.

This movie was extremely confusing even for the most brilliant people on this planet. I attempted to understand the entire plot, what was happening, and I was completely lost. But that's okay. At the end of the day.... You do not know everything about what someone is going through. Whether it be your Dad, daughter, or even a complete stranger, you can't even begin to comprehend. You're lost. I'm lost. So just be kind.

Amazing representation of characters, stunning performances, beautiful costume design, crazy transitions, and thoughtful messages all combine to make the best movie of 2022.

It is rare for me to laugh so hard or cry so often during a film, let alone both simultaneously. Thought provoking and beautiful in its presentation of optimistic nihilism. Great stunt work with wide action shots. Wonderful performances from all the actors. Surreal, unpredictable, and perfect!

22 December 2022,Strange~Loves,"I swear I will never get this title right. It just doesn't flow right in my head. But that is par for the course of the feature presentation.

I really loved Everything Everywhere All at Once, but it's super hard not to. While I admittedly didn't get it all with this viewing, I felt this movie is special. There's so much more I didn't see and can't wait to upon inevitable multi-viewings. This is why I'm glad I chose to purchase this (unseen) vs. Renting it or getting a free trial/one month of Showtime just to see it. Now I *can* rewatch this enough times to absorb it all.

Hard to describe the plot, but it boils down to an everyday Mother/Daughter/Wife with extraordinary worries/responsibilities/troubles and her unexpected journey of self-discovery through...the multi-universes. This could be the unofficial Scott Pilgrim vs. The World sequel I've always wanted.

It's also like The One and, of course, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. It is better than Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and a hundred times better than The One, but I still do prefer Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World more.

Everyone in the cast is excellent - not one single bad performance, but I will give the most kudos to both Jamie Lee Curtis and my personal favorite of the cast/characters: Waymond Wang played wonderfully by Ke Huy Quan. I instantly felt his warmth, charisma and boy, was he adorable. Plus, a good fighter. And OF COURSE, Michelle Yeoh did great. That 100% goes without saying.

One thing I did not expect: this is a straight-up comedy first. I did laugh out loud so...many...times. Sure, there is action. Beautiful, exciting, fun and wonderfully choreographed fighting. And there is heart. Like a ton of it. But, overall, I really saw this as a comedy-drama with some incidental action.

I don't think I'm gushing over this as much as I believe I will with additional viewings. There's a LOT to take in. Like more flashes/subplots/characters/directions still dancing across my brain from this and the movie ended a while ago. It is one of the most original pieces I've seen in a long time. And it's not just the script. Everything Everywhere All at Once...on the screen.

Jury's still out if I'll raise my initial 8/10-star rating as I've been known to do. But this I know: I will be revisiting the Wang's multiverses again soon.

***

Final Thoughts: Naturally, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but it was 100% the ending I was hoping for. I didn't expect it would happen and I was so very pleased with the payoff. I cannot wait to see this again.",8
22 January 2023,"The Movie is Good, but not as good as I though it would be","I have trouble turning off my brain.

18 April 2023,Really Fun; Perhaps a Bit Much Rinse & Repeat,"You know when you are bored and you just keep scrolling through Instagram or Facebook videos and every 2-5 seconds is something different and unexpected. This film had that feel as the characters and scenes move frequently between a multiverse. The high-level shallow plot of the main characters owning a laundry mat and having tax trouble are almost irrelevant to the core points being made about the purpose and meaning of one's existence within the universe. There is often rapid scene cutting between the same characters and the difference between their lives in different universes. This is a fun movie to watch for the visuals, editing, whimsical moments and action but perhaps that got a bit overdone by not bring in the weighty topics until too far into the story. It would have been more effective to give more meaning to the fun hectic scenes earlier to help build tension to reinforce core points.

23 June 2022,Absurd in all the right ways,"This movie is difficult to describe. It is better just to experience it because no description could do justice to the experience that it brings. It is just absurd and crazy with excellent direction and acting. I cannot for the life of me figure out why the emotional beats didn't resonate that much with me, for I have no idea what I'd do differently or better. Alas, the lack of emotional resonance and a bit bloated runtime are the reasons why I choose not to give 10/10 but rather an 8/10.

The movie is full of fun references that probably demand multiple viewings. At it's core is a very personal story to carry the crazyness trough to the end.

There is a lot to praise. The pure imagination and originality. The direction and cinematography. Abiding to basic dramatic concepts such as Chekhovs gun (or should I say 'plug'). The Acting. If the runtime were a bit tighter or if the movie made me care about the characters a bit more I would have been awesome. Still, it is very good and very recomended, though probably polarizing. My wife for example didn't care for it at all and I can't see some of my friends enjoying this. Give it a chance.

BTW. The 'Husband' seemed familiar the whole time and I couldn't figure out from where do I know him. I never realized I was watching Shortstop from the Temple of doom :D.",7
16 March 2023,"Weird, boring, waste of time.","I was suspicious of a movie that won so many Oscars and I never heard of it. It also peaked my curiosity as I felt it 17TRACK must be really good to recieve such Oscar accolade. Sadly I was disappointed. I watched until the end just to make sure I didn't overlook what the academy felt was so great about it. It just never happened. I found myself pausing the DVD player multiple times just to see how much boredom remained. In fact, there is an actual 'The End' moment on the screen. I felt glad, but then discovered there was still an hour left. Oh brother! I just don't get it. With other rather pretty good movies this past year and this one wins out? Sad. Really sad. I did give it some stars because it was directed well and had some decent special effects. Unfortunately it left me unmoved and bored.

26 May 2022,Of all the many worlds...I'm glad I live in one where this exists,"If there was ever a film with a fitting title...this is it, alright.

So much so that I think this might be the single most creative film I've ever seen, and almost certainly the craziest genre mashup I've ever seen. It's a sci-fi, it's a kung fu movie, it's an absurd comedy, and it's a family drama. It is, quite literally, ""everything, everywhere, all at once"".

It's the best Matrix film since the first one, it's got a beautiful anti-nihilist message, it's an exploration of Asian-American identity and generational homophobia, I laughed, I cried, and it's that rare kind of film that just makes the world look a little better to you once it's over.

I realised when I rewatched The World's End that I'm always more impressed by a film that's doing so much stuff that should not work together on paper, and this is like Daniels took that idea as a challenge. Can we make a film that's like Rick And Morty, Police Story, The Matrix, Inside Out and Monty Python And The Holy Grail all had a massive orgy and produced a baby that should be a mangled heap of organs because of how much none of those things should work together, and yet it goes on to win Mr Universe (and hopefully more than a few Oscars too, unless they decide it's too interesting for them like they probably will.)

And as if all that wasn't enough, the performances are all incredible, the narrative is somehow tight and consistent to no end, the directing, editing and cinematography are gorgeous, the dialogue is hilarious, the characters are all extremely interesting...really the only thing I could possibly complain about if I had to is that the beginning is a little slow.

It definitely does all need to be there to set up later events in the film, but I did find myself wondering where it was all going and wishing it would get a bit more unique - which, well...needless to say that wish was fulfilled in absolute spades. Maybe the next time I watch it that'll be more entertaining now that I'll be expecting it, who knows.

But even if that remains an issue for me, I couldn't possibly call this anything other than a masterpiece for the sheer amount of stuff it's doing all at the same time and doing it all so well and perfectly balanced.

Well okay, I will also call it a work of sheer sodding genius. But I'm done now, I swear.",10
4 August 2022,Worthy of the hype,"It's hard not to be influenced by the whirlwind of positive reception this movie is getting, whether you're tempted to go with the flow, or be contrarian and denounce it. Yet it's simply undeniable that this is an objectively well made film. It's firing on all cylinders, hitting all the points in the holy trinity of what I think can make art special: it's entertaining, it's creative and there's depth to it's message.

Not taking on the dreary, self serious tone of typical award winning films, first and foremost, this is a fun movie. It's loaded with fast paced fight scenes, and jokes that had me genuinely laughing out loud. It's a high functioning adventure comedy that's anything but boring.

It may not be the first to explore multiverse themes, but it's wildly inventive in it's approach to them. As proven by Rick and Morty, absurdism is part of package, and Everything Everywhere All At Once doesn't miss the opportunity to get gleefully ridiculous.

It's not all just an excuse to be weird though, and all the insanity is clearly intended to have greater significance. The film feels pretty clear in it's intent, though it's open ended enough to allow you to pull your own meaning from it. Whether you focus on the family dynamic and emotional themes of finding love and purpose in a sea of possibilities, or are drawn more to the existential questions of staring down nihilism in the age of the information overload, it's certain to give you something to think about when the credits roll.

It's got all the basses covered before even taking into account the marvellous acting, editing and effects on display. It's ambitions are high and it excels at it all. Take your ten you magnificent bastard!",10
15 April 2022,"Someone sat down and said ""what does doing taxes really mean""","The movie takes you on a journey with a family who is getting audited. There are so many layers in which the story works, and it's executed beautifully to keep you hooked from the opening shot to the credits. (No joke the audience could NOT get up after).

The movie does not throw everything at you at once, it initially shows you what it is, slowly, it teaches you how to process it's story, and when you're ready, it dumps reality on you in such a brilliant way that you will feel every emotion possible.

The acting was brilliant from everyone involved, the writing is so real considering the topic and genres explored. The cinematography served the story perfectly, almost guaranteeing you not only witness it, but be a part of it too.

The film manages to establish the most grandiose of themes with the most relatable characters, showing the story not just through the characters eyes, but our own eyes.

It sounds clich√©, but very few movies, if any, captures me the way EEAAO did.

The film, in its core, is trying to take the load off our shoulders, the current world we live in has been traumatic for most, and this was just a little reminder to take a step back, breathe, and enjoy the time you have with the people you love.

I can go on and on about the different meanings, but do yourselves a favor and watch it.",10

This is the craziest thing I've seen."" And honestly, I stated getting tired of it after a bit. But just when I started to become weary of the films wacky antics, it started to come together! And by the end this film shows that it has some solid, solid heart. Between its laughable hilarity, and managed to be extremely relatable. It's about finding meaning in the events of your life, it's about accepting your choices and accepting your family members. The acting absolutely sold it. Every single actor in this film to the stunning job. Wonderful, weird, weird work all around.

17 April 2023,Very good but not great.,"First let me state that I watched this movie at home on my 46"" flat screen TV. I provide this information only because some purists would tell you that this impacts one's appreciation of the movie. I feel that this movie is at least 30 minutes too long and it would have been vastly improved by good editing. So much of the action sequences were overly repetitive and unnecessary. Quite frankly I found myself approaching dozing during the middle and even considered stopping watching. I'm glad I didn't as ultimately the best of the movie remained to be seen. Do I think this was a very good film? Yes. Do I think it's one of the greatest films? No.

It takes you in a world that you can definitely relate.

A movie that connects family and teaches us to cherish what have. A human can be anything he or she wants but kindness is what makes all the difference eventually. And it does not cost you a penny.

Engaging, excellent performances, beautiful hair and make up and some mind boggling time paradox.

Watch it or miss something really about you.

It's a real concern that so many people can't see what the film is trying to do.

It doesn't matter. Whatever improv you put on display the usual brainwashing message was the same.

Anyone could make this plot and hand it to a great team of CGI and special effects.

4 June 2022,An original idea wasted,"Look - it's a good movie okay. But listen, this is the perfect example of how strangely movies have come to be made today and why it might be worth questioning.

Back in the day we have The Godfather and Memento for example - very focused on story and character arcs. No one single scene doesn't serve the higher purpose of the story. Each action scene carefully designed, again, to serve the story and perhaps even the catharsis of the film. And today we have the Super hero flicks. And Everything Everywhere All At Once fits into this superhero structure.

It offers a concept, a world, a story, only to throw it in the bin in the 2nd act and do a bunch of actions scenes for no greater purpose than generating a dopamine rushed audience. The tempo and flickering lights and action is so very millennial. It's clearly made for a generation that is used to having their brains reward system massaged every millisecond by rolling screens.

Everything Everywhere All At Once is like a half baked The Matrix on drugs with unicorn sprinkles all over it. Maybe you like that, and then that's great for you!

But I was disappointed. The pace is too fast, the characters are underdeveloped, and the original concept stops developing early on only to be replaced by trippy action scenes. It's a video game kind of movie. Another one of many in these times.",6
21 March 2023,Nothing Nowhere None at Once,"With all the hype and the awards that this movie received I was certainly expecting this one to be waaayyy beyond other movies. However, this movie turned out to be just a STUPID OVERRATED 2-HOUR RIDE best for psuedo-intellects.

Its like that painting at a museum where the artist splashes all the colors haphazardly (in the guise of modern art) and then puts it on an exhibition and then people come stare at it and they come up with some earth-moving, mind-bending philosophies that probably only they can see, and if you can't then they just say - Oh, you know what? Its not made for your intellect.

However, if you still don't believe me, go ahead, try your luck and test your intellectual capacity.

31 May 2022,Amazingly Spectacular,"The Daniels did it again, an original film that is actually enjoyable and hilarious. This is a better multiverse fiom that Multiverse of Madness itself and that's a rock fact. EEAAO is one of the best films of the year and I hope it wins the awards it deserved.

25 April 2023,A Creative Tour de Force,"This movie surely is one of the strangest, weirdest films I ever have watched. Overall, I thought it was excellent, worth seeing if for no other reason than to watch two hours of incredible originality. There's some truth to the reviews complaining that the movie can feel incoherent in terms of plot and, particularly in the latter portions, verge on sensory overload. The characters themselves occasionally say that what's happening doesn't make any sense, which is a convenient way to gloss over plot holes. But, I think the overall arc of the movie makes up for these shortcomings. Ultimately, it's a moving story about a woman's strained relationships with her family members, especially her daughter, and attempting to correct course before it's too late.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is a visual spectacle that veers from absurd to sentimental, comic to tragic, and back again. The film editors and set designers had their work cut out for them, and the costume department deserves an award for Joy's outfits. Even if it all sometimes feels like a bit much - and maybe that's part of the point - the movie is impressively innovative throughout. This is probably the only film on earth with a scene featuring two rocks having a conversation that somehow manages simultaneously to be heartfelt, funny, sad, and entirely bizarre; everything all at once indeed.",9
3 February 2023,Amazingly different movie,"The most unusual movie I have seen, I think. Yes, it is long, but so worth taking it through to the end. Visually it is spectacular, the story is constantly in motion, the special effects amazing. A difficult movie to explain, an element of science fiction, but ultimately a movie about the human heart. If there is a flaw,it is that it is really very, very long, like all modern movies the makers don't seem to understand that sometimes less is more, we actually paused an hour and a half in, and went back to watch the last hour a few weeks later, not sure I could have watched it at the cinema. But ultimately a really worthwhile movie.

24 January 2023,We are living our best version of life,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",9
25 August 2022,"""I Got Bored One Day and Put Everything on a Bagel.""","One of the most intriguing facets about the brave new world of film currently being pioneered is watching history repeat itself. Specifically, watching studios become prominent markers of a film's quality, second only to the filmmakers at the helm. In the early days, audiences knew what they were getting just by looking at the opening logos: the MGM lion signified luxury, the Paramount mountain meant a foreign touch, the Universal globe predicted cheaper productions and monster movies, etc. Etc.

Although the trend certainly isn't as strong as it was, there are a few studios synonymous with the films they make and distribute. One such example is A24, a studio known for some of the most creative, complex, and outside-the-box fare today.

It's not that A24 films are universally beloved or hyper-consistent; they have their share of duds and usually cater to one niche or another. Rather, the studio is a prominent signifier of quality to cinephiles because the films they make and distribute never pander to a broad market or tick boxes on an executive's soulless list. The passion of the filmmakers involved is always evident, and a purposeful vision usually drives the creation of the art. This is more so true for A24 than any studio today, and is most evident in their biggest, brashest, and most successful film to date, Everything Everywhere All at Once.

The film follows Chinese immigrant Evelyn during the course of a very unusual day. While turning in paperwork for her accountant to comb through, Evelyn is suddenly thrust into an adventure concerning the multiverse, a concept involving the existence of an infinite number of universes. She must learn about all the possibilities the multiverse presents while battling a great force that threatens its existence, all while trying to connect with her teenage daughter, Joy.

It's easy to see why the film has been universally praised. There are hundreds of different effects but little CGI, resulting in a breathtakingly grounded film. Everything, Everywhere is a grandiose and complex film, a patchwork constructed and assembled with invigorating passion. Many of today's superhero films are just as visually dense, but Everything, Everywhere doesn't boast a room full of animators to yell at and whip for faster, grander results.

With respect to CGI artists, who are woefully overworked and underpaid, this film isn't just digitally synthesized - it's filmed. It's impossible to state my feelings of gratitude when a film feels like it's truly unfolding before your eyes, when it boasts a concrete foundation of verisimilitude, and Everything, Everywhere clears this benchmark with a story that seems like it never should've. It's resoundingly refreshing.

A24 deserves its praise, but the impetus for Everything, Everywhere's creative explosion comes from Daniels. Daniels (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) are young, but they're already blazing a path for uncanny, surreal filmmaking, demonstrated in their freshman and sophomore efforts Swiss Army Man and The Death of Dick Long. Their direction is kinetic and all-encompassing, a veritable barrage of places, characters, ideas, and impressive action that assaults the viewer unrelentingly.

One of the film's most special characteristics is the scale of its time; most of Everything, Everywhere takes place during a full day, but also, as the title suggest, transcends time and space, reaching into infinite worlds to set up several intrastory vignettes with their own structure, stakes, and pacing. Daniels do a remarkable job keeping focus and clarity despite the explosion of storylines and emotional stakes. There's a pristine clarity to everything, everywhere, all the time.

The film is chaotic and explosive, but it's the editing which truly sets it apart from other equally boisterous fare. While the overarching story moves at lightening pace, it's also allowed to breathe and steady itself, further orienting the audience during the calamity. Nothing is too stylized either, like, say, Run Lola Run; there's a nice balance of quick cutting to maintain the kineticism and longer takes to envelope the viewer into the world. Whatever editor Paul Rogers was paid to work for Daniels, it wasn't enough. Everything, Everywhere has been lauded for a smattering of reasons, but I truly think the film lives or dies by Rogers' hand - it lives.

Everything, Everywhere is the grandest, most elaborate, most painstaking film of the year, no question. It's size and quantity are easy to admire but it's not without its hiccups. Because of the film's size, scope, and genre-mashing, Daniels can't avoid giving viewers whiplash across the film's many storylines, emotional arcs, and tones; they go about eight layers deep and no moment is anything but fleeting. The lulls are brief but so are the film's many highpoints.

Giving proper credence and pacing to the material would take approximately five hours of runtime, and the film is whittled down to an explosive two and a half. Because of this problem, and not despite of it, the film feels overstuffed. There's so much to get to and so much crazy, random nonsense happening at any given time that Daniels feel like they're rushing to give everyone and everything their due.

A golden film rule for creators is ""kill your darlings,"" which is shorthand for ""delete every millisecond of material not essential to telling the story"". I can't even comprehend that there were scenes deleted here, either from the film or the script prior. There's just so much of it...probably about fifteen percent too much.

Speaking of the script...it's a bit unwieldy. The story begins relatively slowly and quietly accelerates, a nice method to introduce the context and subtext of the madness before fully diving in. However, the film also lacks structure, eschewing satisfying cause and effect to instead introduce random concepts and characters throughout. The practical use of the multiverse invites a strong inclination toward randomness, but Everything, Everywhere sometimes oversteps the boundary, hurtling, at points, into the arbitrary.

In a macro sense, the viewer rarely knows where they are in the runtime or how much of story is yet to play out. This lack of sense is most clearly demonstrated during a clever gimmick in a theater, at which point Everything, Everywhere feels like it's finally winding down and will be over in the next five or ten minutes...it then goes on for another forty-five.

The performances are pleasant all around. In the spotlight are Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu as Evelyn and Joy, the mother-daughter duo at the forefront of the conflict. Each plays off the other nicely and they establish a tense but loving chemistry.

Key Huy Quan plays Eveyln's husband Waymond, a sympathetic figure who walks a fine line between put-upon and pathetic. James Hong plays Gong Gong, the patriarch of the family. Every actor also plays a plethora of other roles from other universes, staying grounded and convincing in all manner of costumes and characterizations.

Altogether, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a ridiculously large and raucous film. It maintains impressive focus on character and theme, never letting its central conflict become rote or lost in the hyper speed of the action. If it's ultimately too much of a good thing, it's still the most unique, creative, and ambitious film of the year, and the Daniels deserve significant praise for dreaming it up. I'm sure every eye will be on their next project and there will be considerable attention on this one throughout the year and into awards season. The film has been met with a startling amount of hype, but mostly delivers on every piece of praise it's received. Absolutely worth seeing in theaters.",6
20 May 2022,"Back To The Future on steroids, hugely enjoyable!","These two clever Daniels (writers) obviously put their lockdown to extremely good use. I'm a baby boomer so I cant begin to describe the overlaying themes and narratives, & play on genres and film styles except to say by the end of the film I simply floated out of the cinema on a goodwill high. Don't miss it, and don't take the grandkids (a 15 for good reason: beaten withpenises, finialled doorstops, fingers made of hotdogs... and some!) Enjoy!

11 June 2022,A great story of mother's love.,"In this movie there is something present, absent in many other movies and that is a moral lesson, something to learn, something to take as happy end lesson.

The movie is average 7.5/10 to be more correct. It's great average family (almost) movie that can be enjoyed by everyone. Nothing spectacular, but not a waste of time if you decide to watch it.

30 May 2022,The real Multiverse of Madness,"This is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. Love it or hate it it addresses the idea of a ""multiverse"" and the ramifications of decisions made in one's life, better than any other film I have seen before it. Yes, sometimes I found the humor a bit over the top and thought at certain times things got redundant but still for a fun, thought provoking, must see in theaters film, I truly enjoyed the experience.

5 April 2023,No.,"I stopped paying attention to the critics years ago. Like the MSM, they are beyond degenerate. What concerns me is the audience rating. I am almost certain that bots or sweat-shop workers were employed to upvote this film. Then again, there are an incredible amount of superhero fans, so it's not impossible that we are simply living through an age of quantity over quality.

Do you enjoy watching old folk be superheros? Then buckle up for the ride of your life. Do you enjoy spending hours pouring over plot holes? Then this the film is for you. Do you enjoy watching our world make ""progressively"" less sense by the day? Then you should downvote this review and go watch Everything, Everywhere, All At Once.

9 August 2022,A film about multiverse which explores the idea of choices,"Finally got the chance to see this much hyped movie and I absolutely loved the idea it portrayed.

Basically, we're just consequences of our choices compounded over time. And with every choice we've an opportunity to re-write our destiny! This is the idea explored in EEAAO.

Most sci fi films tend to loose plot in the nitty gritties of technical details but this one had a top notch plot (and a realistic one at that, i mean who's not fed up with taxes?) which gives it an edge over other similar films.

The cast is great (the IRS lady did frighten me!!!) The eerie music complements the family tension very well and keeps the viewer engaged.

I just feel they over did the chaos in the 2nd act, otherwise a great film!",8
13 May 2022,Masterpiece,"Not a lot of movies can be so many genres all at once and succeed at it. Comedy, action, sci-fi, drama, thriller and a love story; this movie achieves it all. Simply put, this movie is a masterpiece.

10 May 2022,A Landmark Movie,"A genre bending movie that will go down in history books as one of the most brave and unique movie of all time. Michelle Yeoh delivers her career best work and is the heartbeat of the movie. The plot is so absurd that we forget the premise of the movie and just enjoy it's robust visuals and crackpot comedy. A movie that should be truly enjoyed in a cinema.

1 May 2022,Gripping from start to end,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

20 November 2022,Convoluted,"This movie is a strange object. Visually impressive, original in its form but also convoluted and overwhelming. The form precludes the depth (if that sentence does make any sense). The goofiness is too strong and emotionally distracting. It's not that funny nor that touching because it tries too hard. Yet there are beautiful moments amidst the sheer chaos.

Michelle Yeaoh is a great actress, really.

And the rest of the cast was very good, especially Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu. Jamie Lee Curtis was having great fun.

(why does imdb requires 600 characters for this review while there are many shorter reviews posted for that same movie?)

5 June 2022,Chaotically Beautiful,"This film has everything a filmgoer would ever ask for. It has comedy, drama, action, and a deep meaning. Aside from the comedic aspect of the film (which was extremly funny), I find that a lot of people that has gone through nihlistic depression can relate to the characters and the message of the film. Definitely a film worth your while.

15 October 2022,Hold the hot chilli sauce - I can't taste the meat,"The title doesn't lie. It just doesn't tell you what happens when you have ""everything everywhere all at once""...you have a mess on your hands!

I can see it lighting up the eyes of a jaded script reader. I'm sure there are not many scripts like it.

But on-screen? It's overwhelming. It's ambitious. It has promise. A heart. But it's all too much for my lil brain to take in and digest at once. We may live in a multi verse but I'm no multi-tasker and this film demands me to be.

Michelle Yeoh is great. There's a lot of messed up stuff going on around her that I don't think was needed to tell the story it ultimately delivers.

Hold the hot chilli sauce a little next time I say.",7
20 March 2023,Too much at once,"People who like this movie but hate the Marvel films are lying to themselves. This is an marvel movie, from the humor, to the formula, to the concept, it completely borrows what makes marvel special. Only thing that maybe is better, Is the filmmaking. The fight scenes are well made.

But the plot, and the concept, and the approach of the atmosphere and design. It just wasn't for me. But even the most objective things, like the plot, or the character-development, it contradicts itself.

(Now a little digression)

You don't need to tick boxes for a film to be great, most of the films that are considered as the greatest films ever made do not do this. They have an artistic approach. Film, no matter if the thematic is good or bad, should always connect with people, or inspire people, or bring people to think. There are so many things that gather my interest because of films, so many things I learned about, whether it's political, psychological, or historical, that's what film is all about and that's why I love films.

But this... I don't see what this wants to be. I don't know what the point of everything was, I thought the the mother and daughter conflict will be the heart of the film, and it would've made the film much better, but it's all thrown away for some jokes. No overall motivation for the daughter to be bad, no introduction to the concept of the multiverse, the whole multiverse is basically trapped into an bagel, and the films answer to all is, Nothing matters, Everything Matters. It tries so hard to tell so much but tells so little. Ke Huy Quan is the only one who deserved his Oscar, Michelle Yeoh's performance is in my opinion nothing special at all. What does she do, besides screaming and fighting? Nothing, she can act greatly, but the character isn't various enough to make her shine.

It frustrates me, that this is what critics call the most ambitious-work of the year. No moments that need to sink in, no moments of depth to think about, is our attention span really that short that this, THIS, is all we can settle with? With every minute so much happening, so much fighting, so much craziness, but no emotions, no feelings, nothing to gather from It. Not only from the movie's characters itself, but FROM the movie's Ideas to YOU. Films inspire and give knowledge.

Everything Everywhere all at once, is too much at once, but still says nothing. No depth in it's plot or ideas, just things... happening. For the sake of nothing.",3
12 January 2023,"Not what I expected, in a good way","I come to watch ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" thinking it is some well-made but run-of-the-mill human interest story of a woman finding her way as she navigates family situations. In a way, it is about that, but a third into the movie, you find yourself catapulted into one of the wackiest rides in cinematic history. The movie tries to answer a lot of our existential questions, and it does so through an outrageous adventure that partly doesn't make sense, partly gives you aha moments, and most importantly it entertains you with the visuals, costumes, action scenes, and endearing performances, especially by Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu who sports the movie's most memorable scene, confidently twirling those ""weapons"" in the air. Jamie Lee Curtis nails it, too, as a government Karen. Just sit back and enjoy the ride and try not to over analyze this like you would ""Tenet"" or ""Inception."" This is a comedy after all.

15 April 2022,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"This was one of the most unique experiences I've had in a movie for a long time. The directing duo of the Daniels follow up their previous masterpiece, Swiss Army Man, with an equally unforgettable watch for any viewer. The film brilliantly combines a bombastic backdrop of multiverse mayhem while also delivering an intimate family drama that will leave the audience in tears of laughter and in emotion. The film is filled to the brim with imagination, creating a world that feels original and fresh. The performances are stellar with Michelle Yeoh delivering one of her finest portrayals providing heartfelt emotion and relatability to her character. The fight sequences are entertainingly choreographed, with editing and vibrant camera movements that allow the audience to be immersed in the excitement. The comedy in the film is also done well, granting the film the ability to be silly and quirky while never overshadowing the overall dramatic narrative. Despite how much of a blast this film is, the runtime may drag in areas making the film longer than it needs to be. However, the film is an overall joy from beginning to end. Telling a story of imagination and an intimate drama, while also providing characters that feel relatable as well as heartfelt, allows for a time at the movies that will be unforgettable by the time the credits roll.",10
21 July 2022,Instant favorite,"I'm looking forward to sharing this strange, surreal tale with my friends! Exactly my type of humor and randomness.

29 May 2022,A introspective socially relevant family drama set in a multiversal chaos.,"There are very few movies where tu expect little and gets so much more in return. This is one of those movies. From the plot, story, screenplay and obviously brilliant acting from each and every cast , especially from Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu to the technical departments like cinematography, sound mixing and VFX, this is a work of art. A Chinese immigrant, running her troublesome laundromat business, facing audit for accounting malpractices founds herself in midst of a multiversal war where some superhuman villain named ""Jobu Tupaki"" is set to disrupt the balance of multiverse. Now she is the only one who can stop her.

Since the multiverse has become a craze on hollywood, very few writers and directors chose to shed some light on the formation of multiverse. Decisions we take in our life , which shape our future can give birth to realities if they are taken a little bit differently. But be it in a same universe or innumerable universes , the life of us and people we know are held together in a basic thread of passion, love, hate, despair, ego. And thake emotions between the lead lady and all the other chracters are weaved so slenderly that those will keep a long lasting impression.

One of the best movies of 2022 and surely a un- missable one.",10

5 April 2023,"Creatively chaotic, a metaphorical masterpiece","This is one of those films that is hard to describe, and is best to experience. It is an entirely unique film with nothing else like it. It's beautifully random.

There are three chapters, everything, everywhere and all at once. It starts with the mundane struggles of everyday life, very much grounded in reality. The difficulty in managing family, a business and yourself and goes on to show the consequences of losing focus on what matters. Like dominos a failing business leads to being a poor partner and parent, then divorce and a failing relationship with a daughter. Through the film the main character questions what she did to get there, and how different her life would be if she took a different path.

Then it moves on to set the premise for the rest of the film by explaining the universe hopping mechanism. It does this gradually and keeps you guessing about how it all works. All the weirdness that comes along with it is a delight. It sparks so much joy seeing the completely random things the filmmakers could come up with, all the alternate realities. There isn't a dull moment and plenty to make you laugh out loud, gasp with surprise or cringe in horror. No expense was spared when it came to the filming and effects either, all was done to a very high standard and you can see the creators were passionate about what they were making. Even the fight choreography was good. The characters are all great and well acted too.

There is a moral to the story, that you shouldn't stress about the things you haven't accomplished. Don't be everywhere all at once. You should be present and appreciate what you have, even the little things, making the most of the now. There are beautiful and touching moments in the film that make you think about what's truly important in this life.

Many films that are a bit crazy like this one don't usually know how to end, but everything everywhere all at once wraps everything up nicely. I felt there were no gaps or unanswered questions. It was just a wholesome, feel good end to a great film.

It was much longer than I expected, I didn't want it to end. If you watch this film in the right mindset, it will make you laugh and cry, and hopefully feel grateful for who you are.",
21 August 2022,"So much fun, but so long","This would have been outstanding if it had been less heavy handed and self-indulgent about the fight sequences and multiverse concept. Ok, I get it, get to the point, I was thinking after about 90 minutes. Lots of great stuff here, but ultimately, like, learn to edit.

We also get a lot of exposition through chaotic flashback, but the daughter with whom Evelyn's relationship is ostensibly the focal point gets essentially no backstory. Yes, accepting her daughter is about accepting herself, but how are we supposed to see the parallels when we see nothing about Joy as, like, a person.

24 October 2022,Superb,"I've just watched the movie. Twice. Had never done that before. And probably will not either. Time will tell, but right now it feels like the best movie I've ever seen. And probably the best one I will ever see.

It's not superficial. If you just want to relax with some popcorn then this is probably not the best thing for you at the moment.

I think the movie has many layers. For me, it is about the meaning of life. Why live. Very deep and brave.

And it's not boring either. Without that frustrating ""just accept things and be happy"". As if that's easy!!!

Even more, the movie has quite a bunch of fun action.

It is a very wholesome, multi-layered and rich piece of art with a life-affirming message, especially for the brave ones.

I watched 2 hours of maniacal, crazy action and over-the-top acting, and I got bored.

14 September 2022,"Life can be a bitter cough syrup sometimes, but...","..there's still honey in this world to make it better. :)

If there's one movie I can recommend someone, a movie that is x1000 better than superhero-crap we watch, a movie so accurate, deep and meaningful that it will leave your eyes welling with tears after some bizarre funny and mundane scenes... your heart and soul will feel the jolt ‚ö°imprinting itself onto your inertia, so you remember it for good! üòä Life can be a cough syrup sometimes or all the times: This movie is about a family, struggling to cope up with life on every day basis, being immigrant, working hard at a coin laundromat, you know a typical Asian baggage you carry once you get married. There's just so much to take and bear in life--and, it goes for each and every one of us. We all have so much going, and sometimes it all just seems overwhelming. Pressure, depression, responsibilities, bills, taxes, job, children, and on top of that the love and care you once had slowly dried out... is this the life we signed up? Is this what multiverse have to offer? No. Life is what we make of it, and that's precisely the message of this movie. A hard-working, dedicated, devoted yet not perfect mother, and how she copes up with her father-in-law, husband, and a daughter who is affected negatively by all her struggle. Because, she's too busy and bound by societal laws to even truly acknowledge her daughter's sexual orientation. Eventually, little dark cloud turn her too bitter towards life. She'd rather be a rock. And, trust me, when you get to this scene where they're rock--you too would be like, yeah, I want to be a rock too. Life's too much--everywhere and all at once, but there's still kindness and love if we keep it alive. It will make life worth living if we take a break from this world's nonsense we humans have enslaved to. All we need to do is take a break, look around, cherish those around us, and life will become once again beautiful and worth living.

Yeah, I did cry quite a bit. Because, I too had these dark clouds hovering over me.

A MUST MUST MUST watch. I cannot insist more. This is x1000 better than any blockbuster superhero crappy movies you've watched. It's truly a MASTERPIECE that you must own. I am going to buy and add it to my library too. BRB. :)",10
22 May 2022,Unbelievable film,"Stunning film, how it mixes action, fighting, comedy, family drama into a film that delivers is some achievement. Gorgeous film with some good family home truths, morals in there. Really surprised by how this finished and delivered. I hope they go and win all the awards, the film, story, cast deserve everything. Stunning film.

From the acting to the directing, cinematography to the fight choreography, this masterpiece is a cult classic in the making!! To put it into simple terms, this is what Hollyweird can produce and create in 2022 if you just let the talent be talent by taking off all the restraints and the leashes.

11 June 2022,Just wow,"Indeed, it was everything, everywhere, all at once. Great story, top-notch acting and awesome direction. I laughed and cried, get scared and amazed, and felt many other emotions during the short period of time of the movie.

The story progress well, not too much introduction or too long ending. Although story evolves around a Chinese family, but the events should be familiar to most of us.

The VFX was not fancy, in a good way. It was not unrealistic crazy visual effects that we see in the other movies, it was there to complete the story.

Kudos to the creator and the team behind this movie.

17 September 2022,"Hi-yah, asian matrix meets rick & morty plus LSD","First of all, you must be comfortable with chinese style cinema or you plain just wont like this film. Demons, possession, extremely fast paced, literal good vs evil etc.

The pacing in this film is incredibly quick, with most hollywood films being too slow, this film is too fast. So many different ideas, so many different thoughts, all whizzing past you at a tiring speed. Although its fast with many moving parts, theres zero depth, like a rambling schizophrenic going 1000 words a minute.

Coming back to the crazyness, this film goes full on 12/10 in wackiness, bizarreness and other abstract outside the box ideas. Just like the pacing, its more schizophrenic randomness rather than having rhyme or reason.

The martial arts are good, the technical side and minimal CGI is always nice to see, but its all rather simple with zero depth. This film displays more like a live theatre production, with you constantly wondering when the literal curtains will fall and youll have to start clapping, instead of being a well shot, well planned, well thought out film.

If youre looking for a super random, almost psychedelic, asian stage show experience, this is it. But if you want anything resembling a coherent film, you will be disappointed. This experiment also runs way too long at 2h20m, we all enjoy some crazy, but not for that period of time.",6
30 January 2023,about us all,"I finally saw it before it disappears into nowhere and all of a sudden. I think the movie is really about us. Not just Asian women, not just women in general, but also men as well. Just ask any dads to see if not most of them also worry about their sons not living up to certain paternal expectations, which may be some subliminal extensions of their unfulfilled alter egos or selves? That said, I think that male paternal psyche if it exists may be more oriental than occidental in general. Crazy movie. Very funny and side splitting performances from everybody. This may be a new trend in the dramatic structure of storytelling.

4 August 2023,A visual barrage,"Wow. Where to start with this one.

An overworked laundrette owner with a problematic father, husband and daughter visits a zealous tax inspector to go through her struggling businesses tax affairs, and during the course of the meeting pathways to different universes open up - each one offering a different version of her and everyone around her.

This film is baffling, bizarre and bonkers. Take The Matrix, Brazil and any Jackie Chan movie you care for, chuck them into the washing machine, hit the fast spin cycle and try to make sense of it. Good luck!

Fortunately the machine will slow to a gentle care wash at the end of it's programme; the film concludes in a slower, more reflective manner around themes of love and contentment. And that is a relief - the manic earlier action takes a toll on the senses and the change of pace comes as a well earned reward for sticking with it. It also gives the film a gravitas and meaning it otherwise would not have.

Indeed it is the offering up of a meaningful message that saves the film for me. Had it continued on its zany, comedy violent, power struggle path until the end it would have been nothing more than interesting trash. But the ending gives us something to think about. We are time poor, bombarded with responsibilities, struggling and striving . . . But how much of our our daily obsessions actually matter in the end? Does that really bring out the best in us? 'There are only two certainties in life - death and taxes' - to hell the taxes, think about what really matters in your life before you die. That's what I take from it.

It is creative and visually stimulating film, with strong characters and doses of oddball humour. Some will love the chaotic muddle of scenes as we rapidly switch between universes, times and character types, but for me I think this hand is overplayed. Yes it's unique and inventive, but is that really the best way to deliver what is an interesting plot line? I'm not convinced. I have the nagging feeling that this film could've been so much more rewarding if the creative team were not so wedded to the manic delivery style.

It's certainly a film I know I'll watch again, since trying to absorb everything on first watching is a bit like counting birds in a starling murmuration. Quite something.",7
17 April 2023,Complete mess,"It seems obvious that someone paid a lot of people to write false reviews. This movie is only a big load of crap, of absurd jokes, of boring script, etc. It's seems like a bunch of kids wrote all the silly ideas that came out of their mind in an afternoon and gave it to the producer. It's simply impossible, seriously impossible that it won any prises ""legally"". Someone somewhere push some buttons, made some phone calls, and that's it... I gave a 2 out of 10 only because I like the main actress. And I felt bad for her, because I am sure that she did not expect such a bad movie. Anyway, any sane person won't be able to give more than a 3 for that chaotic craziness.

15 March 2023,Requires a second watch,"This is a complex movie no doubt and despite all the funny quirky moments, it feels a pain to sit through on first watch. However, it is not random and I started to connect a lot of things when I saw it the second time. It is debatable if that is a good thing or bad. The acting is top notch and I like movies which try to show something different and new. It has some good concepts for eg. A multiverse where every branch is slightly different from the previous one based on life decisions and events and farther you go, more surprises you may find was well presented. Overall it is a fun filled mixed bag of comedy, action, philosophy, drama. I would give it a 9.

31 May 2022,Hope. Kindness. Are you listening?,"This movie captures all the pain and angst and joy and absurdity of life all at once. I'm not even sure the writers meant it to be such an existential experience but it was for me. They break our lives down into the relationship within this one family but it's goes so far beyond the obvious need to heal relationships and let go of unfulfilled expectations that get in the way of loving one another. The movie speaks to our current pain. Our hopelessness. Our disconnection as we fight over our truths. It speaks to finding hope in the absurdity of our individual lives. Meaning in the meaningless. And of living life within the paradox of death. Were you listening? Or do you need to watch it again?

24 March 2023,Use your imagination and love to get out of troubling situations,"EEAAO begins very badly, with incoherent, silly, and nonsensical jumbled scenes. This continues for over an hour. For the first half of it, I can understand all the one star and two star reviews.

I was holding out hope that it would somehow improve, and surprisingly, it did. However, I will fairly state that when the story finally comes together in the final half hour, it definitely still won't be enough for most people. It gets sappy and emotional between mother and daughter as its climactic scene.

Ultimately, I've derived this premise from that chaotic, almost unwatchable first half at times: the movie is about how people can use their imaginations when encountering difficulties and arrive at a decision to use love instead of combat to achieve favorable outcomes in seemingly impossible circumstances. It's about the human imagination's ability to solve problems and arrive at the best possible outcome in that moment.

Now, was it worth that almost unwatchable and silly first hour of mixed up scenes and unrealistic behaviors to tell that story? Probably not, but the meaning of that was to show how in peoples' imaginations, they can be anything they want to be (when they are not liking their current circumstances and outcome), and in doing so, they can realize that none of it matters, and then accept their current circumstance and choose love instead of anger to continue to achieve the best outcome. Use your imagination and love to get out of troubling situations

I didn't like the first half at all, but the final thirty minutes was well done, in my opinion, and it did reach an explanation for what appeared to be a mess of a film in the beginning. However, it's still not enough for me to raise the score higher than:

7/10.",7
10 April 2022,This is by far the best movie I've ever seen,"Nothing is even close. This film is an absolute masterpiece. It is captivating, exciting, visually stunning, funny, original, and deeply moving.

The concept is not like anything I have ever see and at no point did I see where it was going. The action sequences are extremely fun and well done and the storyline and writing are genius. And to cap it off in the end they managed to bring it all together with the painfully universal feeling of futility in trying to find purpose in the pointlessness of humanity.

To come up with something this unique and make it connect on every level a movie can is a remarkable achievement. It is as close to a perfect movie as I've ever seen. The filmmakers made something truly special that sets a new bar for excellence in film for this decade.

I wish Hollywood would ditch the whole idea of Multiverses, and leave it to the scientists, and philosophers. Movie wise, if you can create anything and everything for no apparently logical reason? Then you get lazy script writing, dialogue, design , and effects, since nothing can be impossible. For those who felt moved emotionally or philosophically, or came to some profound understanding of their own existence ?..then yes, its worth a 10/10 rating.

A much more effective film could have been made about family relationships, life choices we make, is it better to regret or accept the consequences? No need for racoons on heads, hot dog fingers, talking rocks etc etc.

18 March 2023,one of the best films I've seen since the 90's,"How can you sum a film like this up in just a few sentences without going on a rant? You can't. Here's a few words. Best Film editing I have EVER SEEN, Hands down. It is extremally fast paced. Great Acting. Over the top zaniness that makes you laugh uncontrollably. Yet it has a real heart and will make you cry. Actors are believable and you love them by the end as it reveals heavy eastern idealism about love and family and rejecting nihilism. Some of the fighting is too much, but nothing a pair of google eyes won't fix. One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Nice to see something original, with actors who don't look like perfect runway models... real people, doing real things and then suddenly thrust into the deepest parts of your imagination.

This is not a film for stupid people. For them there is Cocaine Bear.

The main thing of the film: you may not have it all, but more likely than not: you have all you need.

The filmmakers just chose a fantastically strange and drawn out way of putting that on film.

Nevertheless, the acting, the music, the visuals are all top notch despite its ridiculousness.

If you're used used to reading comics/manga/animation & a movie enthusiast, you would probably not be blown away by this movie as much as the hype would suggest.

12 March 2023,A genuinely unpleasant watching experience,"This film tries very hard to be different and clever. If only it also tried to be enjoyable or at least watchable. It may have many profound messages, but if it does not manage to package them in a way that enables me to spend more than two hours in front of a screen all that effort is plainly wasted. This is a ludicrously busy viewing experience, but that does not in itself make it funny. Unfortunately there are no good ideas in this film, neither visually nor in the dialogue. A lot of good acting talent is wasted on banal characters and a pointless plot. Might this indeed be the first film script written by AI?

In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

18 May 2022,Rollercoaster of emotion,"Laughter-seriousness, sadness-happiness, beauty-disgust, and a feeling of profound existentialism...

I couldn't stop tearing up during the last half of the movie. The writer is able to convey the meaning of life, and able to deep connect to my soul. Being kind to others is my strength, and how I fight.

I really don't want to go into any more details because this movie has to be seen by everyone who is able to read subtitles.

Best movie I've seen since Free Guy.

19 September 2022,The multiverse of madness we deserved!,"Everything Everywhere All at Once tells the story of Evelyn Wang(Michelle Yeoh). Evelyn is a Chinese immigrant who gets catapulted into an insane adventure spanning different universes. She learns that she is the only one who can save the world & the multiverse.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is a mind-blowing film. Directors Dan Kwan & Daniel Schienert have given us a one of a kind cinematic extravaganza that will take you on a wild ride. The action set pieces are some of the best to ever be put on celluloid. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. The comedy makes you laugh raucously, almost throughout its runtime. The emotional scenes are the perfect foil to the non-stop action and comedy of the movie. Michelle Yeoh is spectacular as Evelyn Wang. Yeoh has given her career best performance here & she definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. Stephanie Hsu is outstanding as Joy Wang. Hsu holds her own in all her scenes with the legendary Michelle Yeoh. Ke Huy Quan is brilliant as Waymond Wong. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as Dierdre Beaubierdre. James Hong is unforgettable as Gong Gong. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a must watch for all the fans of the big screen experience & flawless films. Go and have an insanely enjoyable time!",10

25 November 2022,It's worth watching for those interested!,"Im gonna be totally honest in this review, I did not love this movie. I appreciate it's originality and wacky concepts within the multiverse and sometimes it's pulled off very well but in my honest opinion I think this movie is a little messy. Now that could have been Daniels intention, they are the dudes who made Swiss Army Man after all which was weird as hell and an amazing movie that executed it's weird concept in a very thoughful and emotional way.

They go for a similar approach here with Everything Everywhere All At Once and some of the family drama does work very well in this film but I dunno, I didn't fully connect with this one in the way that i'd hoped to after all the rave reviews. They are brilliant filmmakers but I just didn't fully connect with this one in the way I would have liked to. Im still looking forward to what they bring out next and im sure whatever it is will be just as weird if not more.

27 May 2022,Entertaining and fun,"It's a really nice movie and I love Michelle Yeoh in this. I found it original and entertaining. The only quibble I have is that the pace of the action is so high from the beginning and along the whole movie, with no respite, that I was a bit tired of it by the end.

16 March 2023,WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"Everything ALL at Once, WON the Oscar as Best Movie of the year. LOL. That's the stupidest thing I've seen in my 65 years. This movie now bumped the movie I had previously called the worst movie of all time. It was just plain stupid. It was uninteresting. It got so repetitive and boring I almost fell asleep a few times. These people popping back and forth between different realities, just didn't do it for me and from what I read others found it stupid and boring as well. DON'T BOTHER seeing this movie. You will be sorry. Whats with the one reality where people had wieners as fingers? Was this a spoof movie, a comedy, horror, drama? No one knows and no one cares. I left the movie, angry that I was sucked in by the Academy Awards picking it as the best movie of 2022. I will just tell you - it was not!. They got it completely wrong. It was terrible. Horrible. The acting was not great because how can you do a great job acting with the plot was so stupid. Lots of things that happened made no sense. I would have been better off wasting time watching paint dry. Curious Case of Benjamin Button, you are now off the hook. This is now Number 1 - Worst Movie of ALL TIME.",1
8 January 2023,Words cannot describe what this movie meant to me,"And I don't think any amount of words can describe it to you or anyone else.

All I hope to do is convince you to give it a chance. Put away your phone, turn down the lights, get some popcorn and give his movie your fair attention that it deserves.

I don't think I have ever seen a movie that so beautifully captures the Asian American experience so clearly. At the surface this looks like a silly movie, but to me, it's a historical record of what it was like to live in an immigrant Asian family in America. An accurate emotional accounting of what we experienced living in the 90s and early 2000s. It was a painful and wonderful period of time that America might never have again.

Maybe I'm looking into this too much, but it doesn't matter because this is what it means to me and I know I will continue to watch and rewatch this movie probably for the rest of my life. That's how much I love this movie and I'm so thankful to all the creators for making it.",10

15 March 2023,The movie is total bananas,"I just watched it and it is a solid 7.7 for me. The movie is total bonanza. I haven't laughed out loud so much in recent years and some of the scenes may haunt me for a good time awhile in a good sense. Worth watching at least twice, there are a lot of great moments to be appreciated, if you don't look for perfection. This movie is all about ""the stupidity of it all"". Very happy for the cast choice and I wish for a sequel if you will.

For those of you, who might rated it below 7 are very unfair. The moment you realize what he move is all about, you'd enjoy it for what it is. I like the fact they didn't make it perfect or too serious, which I first thought it would be better, but at the end all made sense.

21 April 2023,"Very good, but there are better","It is a fanciful drama or dramatic fantasy. It touches on topics such as depression, the mother/father-adolescent and adult daughter relationship, and gives a twist to the vision that is usually held of what must be done to defeat evil. It's good, but still, personally, I felt like it could have been better. At times I felt that they exaggerated with fantasy, but I must mention that I don't particularly like movies with a lot of fantasy, I prefer drama and precisely the dramatic overtones were what made me like this movie and rate it with an 8 out of 10. Despite everything, I would recommend seeing it.

15 March 2023,Not a lot of substance,"I actually saw this movie a couple weeks after it came out. But didn't even know how to feel after watching it. There were a lot of elements that I liked for example the actors. I'll pretty much watch anything with Michelle in it. Ke Huy Quan Has been a favorite of mine since the goonies. The set and costume design went crazy. But that's the thing. These are elements used to support the story not be the story. When you look up what the story is about there several summaries from different people and different takeaways. It was convoluted and way too long. And I still don't know what it's about.

9 July 2022,Spectacular way beyond my expectiations,"Last night I watched a different multi-verse film: Doctor Weird and the Blabberverse of Nonsense, and tonight this. What a contrast. One is a stupid, formulaic, run-of-the-mill franchise film made with the sole purpose of making as much money as possible and nothing else. The other is a beautiful and wonderfully creative, intelligent, extremely original, and deep story supported by perfect directing, acting, and production. And extremely funny at the same time. A true work of art and love.

I can fully understand and respect that this is not for everybody, but if you're tempted this type of unique films, you're in for a real treat. In my book it's the best in decades. It makes me both happy and hopeful that someone invested money in this, while I'm in no way surprised that none of the usual, big Hollywood production companies did.

18 March 2023,trippy campy unique,"So I typically don't watch this type of genre of movie. It's a campy comedic-drama. It's silly and heartwarming. It's not for everyone. The movie is not meant to be taken seriously. This is the type of movie people study in film school. There's so many messages in this movie that could be dissected but this movie is too long and irritating at times for me to watch more than once. One message was that doing something deemed weird may unlock a new/better life for yourself. I understand why it won so many awards due to the amount of effort and creativity it takes to put a film like this together. However Jamie Lee Curtis didn't do anything spectacular in this film to deserve an Oscar. The other awards I can agree with bc the film caters to the more artsy eccentric crowd. The lead actress and supporting actor deserved their award imo. I rated 7 because the film takes too long to get interesting. The first 45 minutes of the film is pretty tough and I would not watch this film again.

19 May 2022,Absolutely üíØ the MOST original film I have EVER seen!,"EVERYONE NEEDS TO WATCH THIS FILM!!!!!!! I do not even know where to begin or what genre this film should be categorized in but just go with it. Don't ask questions or think too hard the first time you watch it. Just sit back,, open your mind, and enjoy this once in a lifetime ride. The entire cast is superb and the themes, editing, storyline, and cinematography are hands down freaking amazing. I've watched it three times and each time I catch more and more nuances and thoughtful details that I hadn't seen before. I can honestly say this is my NEW favorite film of all time. Go Evelyn! <3.

17 February 2023,Wow - just...wow...,"I don't even know where to begin - umm - how about with the incessant scatalogical attempts a humor, bodily fluids, vomit and giant dildo fight sequences - oh wait - did I mention henchmen attempting to shove butt plugs in their asses because for some reason it allows them to ""channel"" another person from the multiverse? Did you get any of that? Yeah me neither.

This film is only receiving this attention because we all know how political the Oscars are and Asian Americans have had a tough go of it the last few years - there is truly no other explanation. In fact - it honestly is embarrassing to see the academy, which already stoops lower and lower every year, nominating this dreck for 11 nominations. You read that right - ELEVEN! Absolute nonsense. I could go on and on and really pick this turd apart but there's no use - You either take the bait and think it's brilliant because it's just so all over the place - or, like me and many others - you see it for what it is - a juvenile, pale comparison to other better films (kung fu hustle, the matrix, etc)

I should have known I would literally detest this film after suffering through forty minutes of boners and farts in the craptastic Swiss Army Man but I foolishly bought into the award season narrative of this film. Man - about an hour and a half in, I was truly hoping for Daniel Radcliffe to pop up with an erection and blast a hot fart in Jamie lee curtis' face to liven up the proceedings. The DANIELS as they call themselves (already annoying just cause of that) have to be the most childish filmmakers to ever get to the level they are at and so quickly and with such little talent. My god - can they not last ten minutes without something poo poo and pee pee related?? Also - movie NEVER ENDS. Holy Christ I thought Lawrence of Arabia was a long movie - this felt interminable. Lastly, and then I'll stop ranting as it's just beating a dead, dead, very dead horse at this point - what the hell even is the messsge of this movie and what was all that s*** with the everything bagel?? My god this movie was HORRIBLE.",1
28 April 2022,See it to believe it!,"Trust me, the first half or even the first 3/4 you might not get this movie. You're going to want to withdraw, but you have to make it to the end to piece it all together. It's a stunningly beautiful movie with some great messages about mother/daughter and husband/wife relationship dynamics... but you have to go with the flow to get there.

17 June 2022,"Funny, Moving, Clever, Kind, Everything","It is hard to review this film without diminishing it.

The plot - which makes perfect sense as it unfolds - is actually insane. At several points I stopped and realised what I was watching was just BONKERS.

Yet still, I loved it.

And despite how bonkers the film is. And how deeply philosophical it is, it remains a very emotional film. A very sweet-natured and kind film. That's partly the script, partly the wonderful performances.

I genuinely cried, I uncontrollably laughed. And when the film was over I thought about what I'd seen. And so I had to watch it again. And that time I saw even more and loved it even more. And now I want to watch it again.

This is a rare gem. A film as close to perfection as is possible. It looks stunning. It will make you think. And it just made me feel better for having seen it.

It's my new favourite film. And it's just EVERYTHING.",10
18 September 2022,"Hilarious, Bizzare, but Reflective","This movie is as entertaining, as bizarre and as nuts as the title sounds. At the same time it's a movie that will make you reflect on a lot of things. This might be my favourite 2022 movie. I'm so glad I saw this in a full theatre.

This is a proper multiverse movie. When you see the idea of multiverse in superhero movies, it's cool and all but it's never the main focus of the story. This movie on the other hand, really explores what it means for a person, if the multiverse really exists. It asks you, how would you deal with that fact? Let's say every choice you make just creates another universe where you, and everyone else live with that choice. Let's say there are millions of versions of you who are much better off than you are today. Maybe, because of some bad choices you are where you are today. How would you deal with it? Or does it even matter what choice YOU make anymore? The movie brilliantly nails in this feeling of ""Nothing matters"" into it's characters, and it's viewers. And still, it gives out a very optimistic message. It redeems those emotions in a satisfying finale.

It might sound that this is a very serious movie. Trust me, this movie is hilarious for 90% of the runtime. It asks all these serious questions in the most entertaining, hilarious way possible. It's full of jokes and has some intense, dark yet ridiculously funny action sequences with great stuntwork too. It's the sort of movie where you'll think ""what's even going on anymore?"" and not in a bad way, in a very funny way. It's like whatever bizzare, offbeat thing came to the director's mind, he just did it. And I love when creators fully express themselves without holding back. The movie is very fast paced too, full of energy. The editing in particular, is very, very creative.

To make this masterpiece with just 25 million dollar budget, it's a rare feat.",9
30 January 2023,Good Enough,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is excactly what the tittle says. It's difficult to discribe this film A) without spoiling it and B) giving a right account of what is happening. Nothing makes sense and yet, in the end, everything does.

To the core of it all, it's a woman, living a life that she doesn't anjoy, being someone she doesn't want to be. Thus, the movie has this melancholic feeling to it, along with the philosofical questions that raises about family, romantic love, choices, control over our lives as well as the lives of those around us, etc etc

The performances is another killer point of the drama, smooth, without overdoing it even though it was so easy to do so considaring the crazy plot.

So, overall, eight out of ten.

17 March 2023,That transactions,"Does anyone think this movie will turn into an action movie?

I can say that the best part of the movie is that it works on many subjects such as love, reputation and hate...

I can also say that the word that defines this movie is transactions. This is the first time I've seen transitions used so effectively in a movie. No one can count the number of universe transitions in the movie, but we saw so many different universes, it was really good.

It is very difficult to understand the subject of the movie, but maybe that's what makes the movie beautiful and remarkable. I guess some people will try to watch it over and over to understand the subject but it won't help them :)

Lastly, I have to give credit to the actors , It was the best acting I've seen in a long time.",7
2 November 2022,Never related so much to a movie!,"Wow! I read that Daniel Kwan had ADHD and that the movie somehow was going to represent this. I was convinced when I decided to watch this that I would not like it, and afraid that it would be another disappointment, trying to depict the craziness that goes on inside the head of a person with ADHD on the big screen. But man was I wrong!

What a beautiful film, with a strong message and crazy scenes. I felt like they took my ADHD-head and made a movie out of it, just added some extra action and sci-fi.

Everything was perfect the way it was, and it should not have been made any other way.

Everywhere they went in the movie was so beautiful, smart and very well thought out.

And last but not least the craziness of this movie worked so outstandingly well together all at once!",10
25 May 2022,A well-directed bunch of non-sense,"The best thing about this film is its quirkiness and its visual inventiveness. It works very well at the level of comedy and surrealist science fiction. However, the core of the story is a family drama which is absolutely shallow and cliche. The characters become omniscient demigods putting at risk the existence of the multiverse due to them being hung up on daddy/mommy issues. And at the end, everything is resolved by the characters simply telling one another how much they love each other and how good life can be if we are optimistic. I kid you not, half of this film is an over the top melodrama, with the philosophical climax of a tumblr post. The movie takes itself too seriously, and drops all the fun of the multiverse for the sake of a generic ""heroine beats bad guys with the power of love"" action and some LGBT positivity message.

And did I mention how many dildos, butt-plugs and BDSM jokes appear for no reason?

8 February 2023,A Masterpiece of Western Storytelling Tropes from a Chinese Immigrant's Perspective,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" is good because it makes fun of every clich√©d thought you've had in your head. The film is meant to be in your face. The daughter/mother relationship of love vs. Hate vs. Loss vs. Longing etc. Is universal to all relationships. One thing, however, is clear: it is better to give this meaningless existence a try than go mindlessly into the void. This longing to exist is unique to this sort of nihilistic storytelling.

I see... ironically I need more characters because rules exist. I was trying to be concise, which is exactly the point, nothing matters and life is often a chore, but what even is death or non-existence? It's impossible to comprehend truly.

8 November 2022,Too much to digest,"Stunning images. But in the end this film has far too much of everything while it would benefit from just a little bit of good old storytelling. It is so colorful, fast and full of incredibly creative details that you will definitely feel dizzy after 2 hours and 40 minutes of massive non-stop brain stimulation. Make a wise decision when choosing snacks and drinks before watching it.

However, everyone who likes martial arts movies should watch ""everything everywhere all at once"". It probably takes this genre to a completely new level. That said, it's actually pretty impossible to place this movie into a particular genre.

16 March 2023,Hollywood is finished,"I am Asian, I live in Asia and this is my honest review. My first movie review.

In 2022, AMPAS (the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences) made Janet Yang their new president. A Chinese-American woman with big pull in the Asian cinema market.

In discussion with the thirty (30) member executive committee of AMPAS, she decided to have a big Asian diversity year for AMPAS at the 2023 Oscars. Yes folks, it is these thirty people who basically decide who will get Oscar nominations.

They searched and found one American made movie with a large Asian cast, a movie called 'Everything, Everywhere, All At Once'. They immediately jumped on it and nominated it for a record eleven Academy Awards. Basically everyone in the film, (except the janitor) is nominated. All nominations are solely to promote this Asian affirmative action agenda. In addition, AMPAS (and Hollywood) are desperately trying push the gay/lesbian lifestyle onto Asian families. I promise you that this will never work and will backfire drastically.

The Cast:

Michelle Yeoh - a 60 year old Malaysian actress who was in the movie 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' back in 1999 and since then has done almost nothing. She was essentially handed an Academy Award this year.

Ke Huy Quan - A Vietnamese-American who was in one movie about 35 years ago, back in this disaster. He has been given virtually every award under the sun for this role.

Stephanie Hsu - A Chinese-American in her first movie, plays the role of an overweight lesbian and for it has been handed every award under the sun.

Jamie Lee Curtis - remember her from 'Trading Places' and 'A Fish Called Wanda' etc? Well she plays the role of an overweight lesbian and has received every nomination under the sun.

None of the above four do anything in the film that is deserving of recognition. Nothing.

The Film:

A thoroughly confusing, badly acted, terribly scripted set of scenes, that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. The movie is like watching a video game that you can't follow.

It is basically about an Asian couple and their lesbian daughter, who work in a dry cleaning store and . . . There is some martial arts . . . And well, that is about it. Oh yeah there is some martial arts again.

The movie was the worst I have ever seen with an Asian cast and to be honest it is actually quite insulting that AMPAS would choose this garbage to disingenuously praise Asians. We are not that stupid and we are also not that desperate.

For those of you who are interested in Asian movies and Asian culture, here are a few great movies I recommend:

Not One Less (1999), China Lust, Caution (2007), China Audition (1999), Japan Three Idiots (2009), India

There are many others, but sadly EEAAO is not one of them.

In conclusion, this was a tragic case of affirmative action gone wrong. Asians make great films in Asia, but putting them in some ridiculous Hollywood nonsense, giving them one thousand awards and fake praise all over the internet is not the way to open doors of opportunity for anyone. It just causes embarrassment for us, resentment for others and makes us Asians look like we are a charity case. Which we definitely are not.",1
12 April 2023,"Sometimes what you're looking for, is right in front of you","It is my pleasure to review the feature film ""Everything Everywhere All At Once."" Directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, this movie is an epic adventure that takes viewers on a wild ride through multiple dimensions and alternate universes.

The film follows the story of a Chinese-American woman named Maureen (played brilliantly by Michelle Yeoh) who discovers that she is connected to multiple versions of herself across different universes. As she navigates these realities, she becomes entangled in a battle against an interdimensional threat that threatens to destroy all of existence.

One of the standout aspects of this movie is its visual effects. The filmmakers utilize a range of techniques to create stunning and imaginative worlds, from hand-drawn animations to trippy 3D environments. Each reality is distinct and fascinating, with its own unique set of rules and physics. The film's vibrant color palette adds to the visual appeal, making for a truly mesmerizing viewing experience.

But the film is not just eye candy - it also boasts a strong cast and a thoughtful storyline. Yeoh delivers a powerful performance as a woman struggling to come to terms with her own identity and the impact of her choices. The supporting cast, including Stephanie Hsu and James Hong, add depth and humor to the film.

One area where the movie falls short, however, is in its pacing. The first act feels somewhat slow and disjointed, and it takes a while for the story to really kick into gear. Additionally, the film's complex concepts and mythology may be difficult for some viewers to follow.

Overall, ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is an ambitious and visually stunning movie that delivers an unforgettable cinematic experience. Despite its flaws, it is a true feast for the senses and a must-see for fans of sci-fi and fantasy. I give it 8 out of 10 stars, and recommend it to anyone looking for an epic adventure that spans multiple dimensions.",8
6 May 2022,MAY BE BEST MOVIE OF OUR TIME,"I don't wish to write too much about this film in my review. Just go see it, and please share with family and friends. I'm a film-lover, i adore movies like ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" and ""interstellar"", so based off of the trailer, i was sold. I think i left the theater a different person. If you're someone who has ever dabbled with psychedelic medicine, this is a must-see for you. If you're someone who is struggling with depression, this is a must-see for you. If you're someone who is looking to reestablish bonds with family members or friends, this is a must-see for you. For lovers and nihilists alike, this film tells the story of LIFE, in all of its chaotic glory. I can't say enough about this film, and it had me and my friends speaking for hours about existence and how we felt touched forever. 10/10 film. Has something for everyone (of legal age). I'm seeing it again tonight and i will be purchasing this dvd when it's out. Absolutely absurd, but comforting enough to make you cry. Masterpiece of a film and unforgettably unique.

3 May 2022,It sits with me still,"It has been 36 days since I first watched / experienced Everything Everywhere All At Once for the first time and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I've watched it a second time in the theatres since and I'm already planning seeing it as many times as I can before it exits.

It's just a testament to how beautiful and life changing art can be. It can encompass profound truths; wrapped in comedy, absurdism, philosophy, action and drama all at once. It is brutally sincere in the best ways while stretching comedy and taste in the complete opposite direction. It is a movie that wears both its title and it's heart on its sleeve in a way no one could possibly predict.

At this stage it is almost impossible to talk about its influences or compare it to other works of art, authors or directors because the influences are both overt and subtle. Yes it is if Douglas Adams wrote a script about the motherwound directed by Michel Gondry. But it's also Ang Lee directing the Matrix as if it was a parable of generational trauma instead of coming out as trans. It's an insanely wild ride that has the power to heal and change the people watching it for the better.

It's almost impossible to overstate its power. I have personally seen it help a hardened friend come to terms with their depression and loneliness, and soothe the grief of a couple losing their first born to a miscarriage.

It's art at its most life changing purest and that's the highest recommendation I can give.",10

16 February 2023,Ok to watch on streaming channel,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

9 June 2022,"A movie about one girls journey to have her sexuality accepted by everyone, everywhere, all at once.","Yes...my description might seem extreme...but that is what this movie is about.

Its actually a very symbolic depiction of what our generation is currently going through ...and what certain individuals are prepared to do if their ""identity"" is not only accepted ...but acknowledged by all...on their knees.

That said...other than some rather extreme scenes involving plugs and other sex toys, the movie was certainly entertaining.

Some great action, good acting, fantastic humour and also a very emotional story about being accepted and loved by the ones closest too you.

This will not be a movie you will soon forget.",7
4 October 2022,About as well-rounded as films come,"I can't remember the last time I saw a film where it was so clear just how much effort had gone into it. The amount of costume changes and set designs and work put into a tenth of a second shot in this film is incredible. There was a lot of care put into 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'.

This film reminds me of what the MCU films could be if they were actually interesting. The concept of a multi-verse (for lack of a better term) is such a good one to base a movie around. The possibilities are endless.

I was surprised by just how funny the film was capable of being. I could tell immediately how smart and clever it was going to be, however I didn't expect the amount of laughs I got.

The film is long at around 2 hours and 20 minutes and it can get a little overwhelming if you switch off even for a moment. Otherwise though this was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. One of the most well rounded films I've seen in a long time. 8/10.",8
19 May 2022,A unique story set in the multiverse,"It's difficult enough to set the things you did wrong right in one lifetime, she managed to set things right in all her lifetimes, in all the universes. I'm not a huge fan of the multiverse (which is often nonsensical, coupled with lazy storytelling), but this film actually has a message for the viewers: Don't ever give up, it never too late to start. You'll get there eventually.

27 April 2022,Terrible movie. Could not wait for it to end.,"This movie was awful. I came in very excited based on user reviews but it became clear that all of these people must have been on drugs. The movie is wacky but not in a good way, with seemingly random things happening.

I was just waiting for it to be over and if I was not with friends would have walked out of the cinema.

The one positive I can give it is that it is very original and that is not common in Hollywood nowadays.

Don't be swayed by all the positive reviews, this movie is not worth it.

Michele Yeoh stand out performer and deserves all the plaudits but the whole cast were amazing.

This film was so immersive, it was edge of your seat stuff for the guts of it. The multiverse theory is gathering real pace across TV and film I'd expect we will see more it in the future.

But this one will be catalyst. BRAVO.

13 June 2022,Wow,"This is the definition of a masterpiece and one everyone should watch as soon as they can as it's the kind of movie that reignites your passion for cinema. There are movies that make you believe in movies. This is absolutely one of them, an original vision in a Hollywood increasingly prone to repetition and redundancy. It may overwhelm lovers of the mainstream, but its peculiarity is also what makes it special. Were only a quarter of the way through 2022, but I am already fairly confident in saying that this is the best film of the year. Not only that, its one of my favorite films of all time.

14 May 2022,Authors must've went on an acid trip - and came back telling about it but so that you can understand.,"To keep the repetition among reviews brief: most creative movie I have ever seen, crafted well from overarching storyline and philosophical messages down to tiny details, very compelling character development, flawless acting, visual feast, fast-paced and complex but never overwhelming, utterly hilarious, applied humour ranges from flat-out college humour to subtle situational comedy - very brave, bold, heartfelt, relieving and intelligent.

The movies effect of flipping the viewer between laughing, crying, thinking and awe continued for me after I left the cinema: Sat in contemplation at first, then cried - and went on to have the happiest night of this entire year. This movie can change your life and your decisions.

To add something new: Why is noone mentioning the incredible job that the costume designer had done here?",10
26 February 2023,"There's a great movie in here somewhere, but I struggled to make it to the end.","I'm giving it a 6 because I think it's worth checking out and it deserves praise for trying to do something different. My personal rating would be lower.

Which is unfortunate because there's a truly great 100 minute 10/10 film in here. But it's ruined by pacing issues and a mix of alternate reality shenanigans. Half of which I loved and half of which I hated. And when you're switching from great to terrible to boring and back again every minute you just end up with whiplash.

-------------

Part 1 has by far the worst pacing issues. At 85 minutes it could be an entire movie by itself and you really feel it. It takes far too long to get going, has a really good middle third, and then starts getting lost again.

You could cut half an hour out and the film would be much better for it.

Then as for the shenanigans. Some of them worked for me and some of them just did not. At all. And they kept taking me out of the great experience I was having.

The sex toys in particular I would remove entirely. For a movie that gets surprisingly mature and profound, they were immediately jarring whenever they came up. It didn't come off as whacky and absurd, just juvenile. And incredibly overdone.

The rest I could probably live with if the film weren't dragging on so much, but if I was going to vote I'd also get rid of the hot dog universe and the raccoon. Both were fun, for about a minute. And then just increasingly annoying whenever they came back.

So maybe it's back to pacing issues as the #1 problem from which all else stems.

----------------------

Ultimately then, an interesting but frustrating experience. I'm glad I saw it, and I'd like to see more films try and do something different with the formula.

But thanks to the editing and the pacing, it's a film that I appreciated more than I actually enjoy watching.",6
18 April 2022,Phenomenal. Unbelievably Great. Top 50 Film of all Time,"It'd be impossible to even try to explain this movie. Not just the plot but how many different ways it'll make you feel/react throughout it's run time. I'm definitely not a cryer when it comes to watching movies, at best a handful of movies have made me tear up, this movie did that MULTIPLE times... But also made me straight up belly laugh even more. I LOVED this film.

19 September 2022,A whacky chaotic absurd and beautiful love story,"I know that this movie will not be everyone's cup of tea. If you are not an Asian growing up in an Asian household or know the Asian culture really well, it might be difficult for you to understand the issues presented in the movie. The words from Evelyn to Joy about she's getting fat might be harsh but it happens a lot and it's actually coming out of love. I know that doesn't make it right but it's how it is in the culture.

The movie can be chaotic but that's what the point of the storyline is all about. The world is chaotic. Our life is chaotic. Even the ever expanding universe is chaotic. It can be exhausting to watch the movie with that crazy pace. But isn't life is just like that?

This movie is a love story. Between man and woman. Between parents and their kids. Between friends. Even between strangers. The messages might be cheesy but they are always true and they can always be applied to the life and relationship. It was wrapped in absurdity and outrageous scenes. And that is life. Even in the crazy world we are living now, the messages will always be true. That kindness, understanding will always the right way to deal with chaotic life. Some of the lines really hit home for me personally. That 'I would have really liked just doing laundry' or 'that's how I fight' are so poignant.

I really like Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. I was excited to see them in one movie. And what a treat for me to watch them in this movie. The other actors are also amazing. Playing a character in a movie with this kind of storyline and mix of several different genres are surely not easy.

I do genuinely love this movie. It will be one of those movies that leave everlasting message to me personally. In a crazy world like this where we are bombarded with terrible movies, it's nice to still be able to find gems like this. I hope this is not the last.",10
28 May 2022,A tough one to rate,"This movie is indisputably creative. It's been done by true cinematographers and only cinema could offer such an experience. The formal originality and the involvement of the actors are real and strong. But... and there is a but...

The story is weak. You can try it from any angle and this movie beats a record in the number of angles used in any movie before, the story remains weak.

Yes it makes sense in the end. Fortunately. Because the beginning is a happy mess. But when sense appears, the magic goes away.

The movie is powerful. It has been carrying a lot of spectators and let them with a sense of joy and freedom in the end. But this joy and this freedom won't last because the movie will not reveal anything to each one of the spectators. And that is where its failure stands.

In this, Everything Everywhere All at Once is not a masterpiece. It is an original take, for sure. But it misses it fails in revealing important things in people and in becoming timeless despite it really trying to.

When reaching this level of formal achievement and creativity, I really hope the ""Daniels"" will improve on their depth and finally reach their goal someday.",7
19 May 2022,The Emperor's New Clothes,"Everyone is in awe of the Emperor's fine new clothes. How stylish they are! How magnificent! How artful and clever! The truth is of course that the Emperor has no new clothes. He's buck naked or if he's dressed at all it's in hand-me-down rags and remnants borrowed from others. But whisper it who dare lest they be thought a doofus, a philistine.

Let's just grasp the nettle here. This is a bad film. It's completely uninspired, using old sf concepts as if they were somehow original or clever. The actors try their best but have so little to work with that they come across as talentless hams which I'm sure they're not. No, the responsibilty for this mess lies with the director and the writers. The only people this will impress are those who have never read or watched intelligent science fiction and obviously there are a lot of them out there.

Such a boring movie and it feels so bloody long and good films never seem long. You never want them to end but with this one you wish it had never started.",1
6 September 2022,A Landmark film brimming with creativity & heart,"Films like this remind you why Cinema is such a magical form of art. Exploding with originality & creativity, so many times I was stunned by how they were able to pull off some of the scenes. Its a story of a chinese immigrant facing financial crisis, who is suddenly tasked with the responsibilty of saving the multiverse. The comedy in this film is bonkers and so weird & I loved it, reminiscent of those Stephen Chow's legendary Hong Kong films. The action brings back the flavor of Chinese KungFu movies, so well choreographed. So many philosophies are discussed, the multiverse becomes a reflection of a human's unfulfilled hopes & dreams & possibilities. It dwells on nihilism, absurdism & depression. And all these are bound by strong emotional familial ties and superb performances. Ke Huy Quan is the heart of this film, playing a goofball husband who always disappoints his wife. His words make us realize where the value of life lies. And obviously Michelle Yeoh, what a performance !! She is perplexed, bitter, funny, awkward & so loving. The direction, editing & VFX are revolutionary. This is the film of the Year & You dare not Miss It.",10
27 June 2022,"Very creative and unusual, surprising, and a little confusing and silly","To be honest, in the first 15 minutes, I had no idea what to expect of this movie. It took me by complete surprise. With infinite possibilities, you will never know what to expect from one minute to the next. There are silly parts, goofy scenes, emotional moments, and brilliantly crafted shots. One of the better movies I have watched this year. Very, very creative.

18 April 2022,Everything Everywhere was Perfect,"This is a movie done right. The main theme isn't original, but the way its told is truly unique. This is a story that cannot be a read because of the visual aspects that go into it which makes this a perfect movie. The cinematography, the chorography, and the visual effects go hand in hand, while being able to be comedic when need be. The acting was also really well done, no one felt out of place and they truly felt relatable in some aspects. I have nothing negative to say about this movie, that's why it is a ten out of ten in my book.

The ""multiverse"" plot isn't new, but how they navigated this familiar storyline absolutely was. This cast was stellar. Kudos to all involved on the creative side.

The comedic flair of the film was authentic and natural. The stunts were absolutely perfect. The score kept us viewers engaged. The costumes were whacky but also spot-on for the periods they were chosen for.

I want to see this again! Michelle Yeoh better win an Oscar for this. 60 years old and carrying a martial arts film on her back like this?!

27 July 2022,Good perspectives,"You know it's not massive acting talent. But I enjoyed this movie because it really provides some interesting perspectives on quantum reality. But moreover, the reflection on what's important is appreciated. People, love and family are always more important than any quantum reality. Like they say, ""nothing matters."" But ironically, the movie highlights the importance of being together, loving and accepting each other as we are. In the multiverse, there is a version of you that has done everything you ever wanted and dreamed of. So none of it really matters. But people and relationships do matter.

5 June 2023,Best picture winner at the Oscar's? Are you kidding me?!,"The Oscars, as we knew them, are no more - haven't been for a while, actually.

Once they represented excellence, when they awarded truly great movies with prizes.

Sure, they sometimes missed the mark. Like in 1976 and 1980 (Rocky over Taxi Driver and Ordinary people over Raging Bull? - pleeease. But at least both Taxi Driver and Raging Bull were nominated)

Everything, everywhere all at once, Nomadland, Parasite, CODA, Power of the Dog - these are not great movies.

Hell, they aren't even GOOD movies. What they are, instead, are movies, that hit all the politically correct notes.

So, that is now the Oscars.

Not artistic excellence, but, as their new official rules state: The Academy of Motion Picture will disqualify movies from Best Picture contention that do not have enough black, gay and disabled actors in the cast and crew from 2024.

Actually, they have done exactly that since at least 2020.",4
20 September 2022,"fun,fun,fun","What a triumph of a movie.

Entertainment, fun, pathos, laughs, surreal elements and a kookie unique story that suprises with every turn of the script.

This movie dosen't take itself too seriously, its aim is to entertain with a brilliant cast who outshine in bringing it alive, with keeping your attention as you ain't quite sure where things are going to in this rollercoaster ride of kinda everything all at once.

They've managed to create a great balance and thought deeply about what they are doing, bringing in their own enjoyment, cynicism, fun and double edged meanings to things, very impressive stuff that sadly makes much of the current Hollywood offerings seem banal and dry in comparison.

17 May 2022,Being Michele Yeoh,"Not like anything you've ever seen. Imagine Being John Malkovich made by a mad and warring combination of Monty Python and Disney. And it's even more gonzo and weird and wild and original than that.

Unfortunately, just as you feel drawn into the existential complexities that one half of the creators are trying to explore, the other half interrupts with this godawful family values sugary nonsense. A touch of the Disney idiocy that infects and ruins an awful lot of modern cinema.

And yes it tries too hard and tries to push too many things into a too small container and goes on too long. But unlike almost all modern cinema it actually tries to push the boundaries . And succeeds in many places and many different ways.

And you simply cannot miss it. Miss Yeoh is truly spectacular. A depressed and anxious middle aged owner of a failing laundromat with a husband who wants a divorce and a daughter who seems to hate her, harried by the IRS in the person of Jamie Lee Curtis (worth the price of admission all alone), she finds that she exists in a parallel universe where she is the glamorous, rich, uber successful Kung Foo goddess Michele Yeoh. And exists also, somehow, in many, many other universes as many of the paths not taken in her life.

And it is hysterical in parts. In fact it is so good so often that one is forced to think the family values jam larded over much of it was forced upon the directors by the studio or the backers.",8

1 August 2022,Turned it off with 20 minutes to go,"After seeing the high rating on IMDb, I've been wanting to watch this. Finally got a chance this weekend and... Unless I'm missing something... It was meh.

It was just not intriguing enough to keep watching. Then 2 thirds in it got downright wacky. Did they BUY these great ratings?? I was getting sleepy and honestly didn't care how it ended, so I turned it off. I did love the actors though.

10 April 2022,"Has everything. It's funny, it's depressing, it is an original mind bend","I did not have the highest expectations going in, but I left thinking it was the best movie I had seen in quite awhile. There were times when I couldn't stop laughing, truly. There were times when it made me think about the depressing aspects of life. It had bold moments including about a 2 minute bit in the middle that can only be described as incredibly risky, but I thought it worked. With all of the multiverse movies out now, it managed to be an original premise. I will be recommending this movie to everyone and I suggest you give it a watch too.

6 August 2022,MOST OVERRATED AND DISGUSTING MOVIE OF 2022,"The movie is extremely overrated and very disgusting at some moments. It has a lot of nice fight scenes and messages but when the creators want to make movie more meaningful they made it just bizarre.

16 July 2023,Everything and everywhere,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I did not know what to think about, but once it won best picture at the 2022 Oscars and people were saying how good the movie was, I decided to check it out. The movie Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) was outstanding to watch, especially with the great performances from Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan who make this movie entertaining and fun to watch with all the weird stuff that happens in this movie.

Michelle Yeoh gives a fantastic performance as the main protagonist Evelyn Wang; struggling with her family, specifically her daughter, and is learning about the multiple universes out there with the many lives she could have led. She does a lot of stuff in this movie that is impressive from emotional scenes to fight scenes, she does them all outstandingly. Evelyn's husband Waymond Wang played by Ke Huy Quan was great; letting Evelyn know about the many universes and the threat they must face to save everything, while also telling her how to gain abilities from other versions of herself. He was also great in the emotional scenes and action scenes.

The whole movie is very weird, but weird in an incredibly fun way, and it can also be funny in an incredibly entertaining way. The fight sequences are incredible to watch with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan doing the stunts themselves, along with the many universes they show of the main character being weird, interesting, or surprising in the way they show them. The effects in the movie are exceptionally good, and another actor in this movie was Jamie Lee Curtis, who was incredibly good in the many things that happen in the movie.

The movie Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) was incredibly good, and I recommend giving it a watch when you have the time. The use of the many universes was cool and weird, the acting was great, the fight sequences were amazing, and the whole concept of the movie is intriguing. Keep in mind that this movie is weird, so you will be asking a lot of questions on certain things that happen in all three acts of the movie.",9
23 May 2022,"Worth watching, but just once","Cinematography was stunning - a feast for the eyes visually. I was immediately captured in the beginning, but I'll admit that this film got weirder and weirder to the point that I almost stopped watching it. Without spoiling anything, let me just say I'm glad I stuck with the film until the end. Despite the over the top ridiculousness of some of the scenes, this film successfully told a contemplative story that'll surprisingly tug at your heartstrings and keep you talking about this movie long after you've left the cinema. The cast was great. I'm glad I stuck with it, but I also don't see myself watching this again. The movie seemed longer than it actually is.

23 March 2023,Clearly this wasn't a film for me.,"I have no patience with stories where some individual (or group) is tasked with saving the world - galaxy, universe, multiverse, whatever - from some unspeakable metaphysical doom. Nevertheless, at a friend's insistence amidst the pre-Oscars mania, I sat thru the entire 2 hour & 19 minute kaleidoscope of frenzied special effects, chop-socky fights, silly costumes & deep mystical dialog like ""You're capable of anything because you're so bad at everything.""

Giving credit where it's due, Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan & also Jamie Lee Curtis absolutely earned their Oscars. Their skilled performances furnished what little enjoyment I was able to derive from this piece of dreck. Best picture?? I'm astonished this pointless piece of supernatural fluff was even in the running! One quote from the film itself sums it up for me: ""It's all just a swirling pointless bucket of BS.""

5 May 2022,I can handle multiple universes but it's unbelievable for a Boomer to recognize generational trauma,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

18 March 2023,TRAGIC... WE'RE SO USED TO IT BEING HANDED TO US,"It's so sad that if a storyline isn't handed to us, it's not good. The name of the movie is ""everything, everywhere, all at once"" and still you get reviews of people, describing it as ""... a mashup of bizarre and strange things happening, I don't get it"".... I mean??? Am I missing something? Were people expecting another Marvel movie? Or maybe the new, new, NEW ""X-Men""? I like a good X-Men movie just as much as the next person, but holy @&$#! How many of them can you watch? How many of them can they make? I remember when Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came out they thought it was a bunch of Asians dancing around on the screen. The general population thought it was crap. Ang Lee won a bunch of awards... didn't matter at the time. Now movies like Crouching Tiger are the formula for how all martial art movies look. Innovation.... INNOVATION. Think on that for a minute. Or go see the next DC/Marvel mashup. However, they only MAKE those DC Universe movies look amazing in the ads.

15 July 2022,Just an OK movie,"Nothing good here , it was terribly over hyped. It uses too much effects in too little of a time just to confuse you and people may think wow this is so different when it really is for people with attention span of less than a gold fish. It plays emotional music. The movie starts really slow that many will quit the movie in 30mins. Also some disgusting parts too in the movie , which we are supposed to laugh at but feel really bad.

4 May 2022,A Masterclass in Creativity,"The Daniel's are a pair of directors who need more love in my personal opinion. This being their third feature length film, it is absolutely bonkers. Having been a fan of their work for a while after seeing ""Swiss Army Man,"" I was anticipating this movie. I had high hopes and they were exceeded. The cast is absolutely fantastic, the script oozes with complex themes of generational trauma, existentialism, and most importantly creativity, and it's an overall intriguing watch. From an outsider's perspective, the movie is nothing more than some weird, dumb movie. However, it's completely the opposite. Never have I seen a movie so perfectly balance so many genres in one film and not seem overstuffed. The Daniel's are extremely creative individuals and it shines all throughout this movie. If you haven't already seen it and you're still on the fence about this movie, go and watch it. I highly recommend this movie.

27 November 2022,6.5/10,"As other reviewers have highlighted, this movie is a trip. It truly exemplifies the mental gymnastics your mind sometimes has to go through to come to a simple realization.

I loved the concept of this film and the overarching themes are deep, emotional, and powerful. It explores topics like love, mental health, regret, and how simple, seemingly meaningless decisions have a butterfly effect on outcomes. For this alone, it is absolutely worth a watch.

What didn't land for me, personally, was the attempt of comedy- mostly in the first act. It just felt too slapstick and ridiculous. Juxtaposed to the deeper themes I mentioned above, it just felt like it didn't mesh and cheapened the experience a bit.

The second act got me back into the movie and I think it didn't a pretty good job and tying all the chaos together to show the viewer what this movie was truly about.

Kudos to everyone that worked on this movie. It was chaotic for the viewer so I cannot even imagine the monumental effort that was put into directing, costume design, and editing this film.

In conclusion- This film was a wild viewing experience, truly everything you've heard it to be. I wanted to like it more than I did, but I felt like it pushed me away at times with how ridiculous it was. Thankfully, it pulled me back in to appreciate the beauty of the film was trying to say.",7
17 June 2022,All the realities are within your grasp,"Brilliant. Good concept dealt beautifully with technology and emotions. What matters st the end is the kindness. Love truimphs hate? Or maybe not. This is the things we love to see and adore. Lots of things on my mind. A good lesson too. The failed parenthood, the burden of existence, fear of not being enough... ups and downs, everything is happening everywhere and it is happening all at once. Can we get through it? Or we will fall into the void. Watch and fall in love.

3 May 2023,Weird random emotional movie,"I was very very entertained wstching this movie.

It is very weird and there are people who don't understand it. Personally, I liked it very much because it is very random, funny and also very emotionally deep.

At first the viewer doesn't know what is going on but it is very easy to catch up with the plot. The special effects are astonishing and the plot is well written.

I loved the main character with all my heart and how she evolves during the play, becoming more empathetic with her child.

I think the girl who plays the daughter did an amazing job and she deserves every award possible.

The rock scene is my favourite because it is very funny, and I liked the final scene too, although it seems to be very normal compared to the rest of the movie.

I loved the father too and I empathized with him a lot.

I found it a little bit long, though.",8
10 April 2022,"Frick'en a, best movie of 2022, calling it!","Every emotion felt. I got a lump in my throat more than once. Laughed, cheered and applauded more than a couple times. A lot was going one but I was never lost. Exceptional writing. This was a top notch, well written comedy-drama. Thank you for not treating the audience like they are incapable of understanding a multiple layered comedy. I hope more films like this emerge because it's pieces like this that truly should be a game changer. I want to go out and do weird stuff to connect with my other dimensional self now hahaha! Excellent film, wow!

20 May 2022,AMAZING!!,"This movie felt like a hug for me, for the people who are suffering a lot, asking themselves what would happen if I did this or that? People with existensial crises and people with suicidal thoughts. Even if you think it is all useless, nothing good is going to happen and you have had enough, there is still a way out. When there is an argument, don't just throw fits, but try to understand and try to be kind, because in the end, we are all humans who are going to die one day. We are stupid and nothing matters in this infinite hole. Yeah, nothing matters, but you matter. In our tiniest, weakest, silliest lives, it matters.

31 May 2022,Damn Near Perfect Film,"A truly bizarre mix that I guess could be sold as Matrix meets Parasite. A hardcore acid trip with hilarious scenes (Jamie Lee Curtis is stunning), great acting and dialogue, and a head scratcher bonkers story. The only thing that could've made it a perfect 10 for me is if they tightened up a few scenes (they really threw everything but the kitchen sink into this everything bagel). I laughed out loud several times, got emotional, cried, and screamed during a few scenes. That's all you can ask for in a great movie. See it on the big screen.

10 July 2022,What the heck was that?,"An hour in and I couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about. I just about stopped watching. I think that's where the majority of the bad reviewers stopped too.

Around the nth ending I finally saw the light. It was around the same time I finally figured out that was Jamie Lee Curtis.

It ends way better than it started and the start could have been cut by a good 20mins.

I'm glad I watched it. I won't forget it. It made me think about it long after I watched it. What more could you want in a movie. Seriously, it had butt plug fu. How can you not smile after that?

Stephanie Hsu is becoming a breakout star in my opinion. She absolutely won me over in Mrs. Maisel and in Everything Everywhere All At Once she was easily my favorite part of the film. She carries with her perfect comedic timing but also with her serious heartfelt moments.

10/10.

1 May 2022,If one can get past the first 30 minutes it all ends in a brilliant mess!,"In the first 30 minutes, I considered leaving the theater disappointed (the trailer made it look like an awesome film).

I've seen most A24 films, and all have been quite amazing in one way or another.

I'm glad I stayed in the end, though there were points where I did think, ""is it over yet?. This is usually only a feeling I get if it's not a very good screenplay or the director has no idea how to end it, or Hollywood decides to take over an ending.

Michelle Yeung is an excellent and brilliant actress and now has shown she can be quite hilarious too.

The daughter in the film I was very impressed with as a young actor with her many different takes on her character, and halfway through, I realized the dad was the kid in the 2nd Indiana Jones film!

The costumes and sets were amazing, and some only appeared for 3 seconds! The directors get high props from basically everything all at once in the editing and filming, except the kitchen sink, as the saying goes.

The screenwriters get props as well with some great comedy hot dog hand universe, and one of my favs was the bagel of existential despair.

There are great moments of Zen-like silences of contemplation in the chaos, like the ""2 rocks"" overlooking the immense canyons of the creation scene.

However, at its heart, it's really about family, unconditional love, the fears of losing out on something that passed us by when married, but foremost was the bonds of love and hate that all mothers and daughters struggle with we find comes universally, no matter what culture you come from.

A must-see but not perfect or a masterpiece, but I do not believe that was the intent in the end. It's meant to be chaotic, silly, and philosophical.

Sadly with way too many tv and films blasting multi-universe themes these days, I hope all can catch this film before it's too late, like when our pop culture ruins such brilliant ideas and themes if it hasn't already. It may be too late anyway but perhaps not in an alternative A24 Chinese family experiential film universe!",7
7 August 2023,Bored,"I'm trying to sit through this very difficult movie to the end, but my brain gave up after about half an hour. There is no way to make sense of any of this. Is it supposed to be clever? Funny? (It is funny in parts, I suppose) I knew it would be confusing but I expected to understand some of it. I'm bored, tired, confused and I don't care about any of the characters. It's obviously taken a lot of time and skill to produce all the weird effects, I get that. But what a waste of effort, to my mind. I'm not into alternate realities or violent computer games. I don't see how anyone can make sense of this.

30 January 2023,This movie made me ugly cry at rocks,"This is my favourite movie of 2022. It does what Multiverse of Madness failed to do, which is present an interesting multiverse tale, while never losing sight of the emotional core of the movie AND exploring deep philosophical ideas at the same time.

Everyone on the cast and crew of this film brought their A game. It's incredible how good the visual effects look when you learn that it was all done by a team of 5-ish people. It made me ugly cry at rocks. There are certain scenes that will stay with me forever, especially when it comes to the character of Waymond Wang. (If you're a Superman fan, Waymond is probably the best ""Clark Kent"" character that I've seen on the big screen in years. He proves that being kind and believing in the best in others has never gone out of style.)

I don't want to give away any major details since half the fun of this movie is being pleasantly surprised at all of the things that happen in the film. Please go watch this movie!",9
7 August 2022,The most original movie I've seen in a while,"The last movie which made me feel this certain type of way was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

4 March 2023,Way Overrated,"This is clearly one of the most overrated movie going and thus a huge let down. The movie is only barely watchable because of a great performance by Michelle Yeoh, otherwise it would be a flop. Watch it but wait until it's available for free.

With so many ""best movie"" ever type reviews attempting to drive home the exact same point, it is very much suspected most are bots or those trying to monetize the film.

The Good: Michelle Yeoh turns in an award worthy performance. Kudos to other cast members for keeping up with her.

The Bad: Thd film is overly complex, cold at times and an assault on the senses . It gets lost in the weeds mid way through and ultimately takes the writers over 2 hours to tell you what you should be feeling as a human. Fail! Ultimately the film overstays its welcome.

If you like indie style films this ""may"" appeal to you. However, if you want to sit back, relax and just be entertained there are better options available.",6

But it's just.....wow. There's so much I can say, but just do yourself a favor and watch this incredible movie. I don't understand how it only has an 8.2 on here, but do yourself a favor and ignore the score and just watch the movie.

13 March 2023,An OK but fun movie,"When I watched this movie I wasn't prepared for it. I thought I would watch a Sci fi comedy, a common blockbuster movie with the usual jokes and the usual fight scenes. This movie was not that. It was weird and a bit difficult to follow at times, and it had throughout the movie an allegory for family and acceptance? Human relationships in general? It was alright, and maybe it was the factor that made this movie oscar-worthy, but I wouldn't say it was the strongest point. For me I enjoyed the humor of the movie. It made me laugh unknowingly, and I believe it is difficult to find good comedy. The fight scenes were also really nice and the actors all performed exceptionally for such an unusual movie.

In summary, I would say it was an OK and fun watch, following the ""multiverse"" trend. I can't say if it was oscar-worthy, but I believe it is more original and fun to watch than some previous oscar winners.

14 March 2023,What! This is a B grade effort,"I'm a science fiction fan and I particularly love the time travel genre. So as soon as I heard about this movie I put on my list and was even keener to see it once it was slated for the Oscars. Talk about disappointment! How did such a B grade effort get seven Oscars, including Best Picture? The acting was okay, but nothing special. The plot was very ordinary and once you were told what it was about there was simply more of the same with a rather weak attempt at some sort of moral lesson at the end.

Every now and again we see a movie that must've had some sort of 'woke' boost, like 2016's ""La La Land"" (still sporting an 8 on IMDB - amazing). I believe ""EEAAO"" is another example of the Emperor's new clothes. I am so angered by the thought that I could have used the two hours to watch something else.

11 April 2023,bored boring most of the time,"If you've seen series such as Rick And Morty this is going to feel boring. Yet if you've never seen anything like it you're in for a treat as I've yet to see a movie like it. Yes there's some humor splashed in and the casting is done quite well. They set up the story quite well where everything will work but if it was me I would have just made this into a dark humored series with 10 or 12 episodes.

My big problem is that this movie is WAY too long. Sure we've got Lord Of The Rings to James Cameron films that worked for their over the top run time but no matter how many awards this movie won the director did an awful job keeping our interest. The way they scored the movie with this big epic soundtrack playing signifying that the movie is almost over played throughout maybe last 30-40 minutes to the point which just drives you nuts where you're just pleading to your own multiverse hoping if you did something stupid or embarrassing that this 2 and a half hour long movie would finish. I found near the end of the movie they could have done serious cuts and it would not have affected the story at all. It seemed all they cared about was the special effects, the countless costumes they get the cast to wear. Some for not even a minute each.",3
10 September 2022,Amazing film,"Absolutely gripped, fascinated and thrilled by this entire film. This film was creative, action packed, funny, very well acted and put together. The writing was excellent, the dialog AND story. The acting was perfect, no one was lacking and no one over acted either. To top it off it was casted perfectly, Jamie Lee Curtis is amazing, it was funny to see her take on a more light hearted role in this film. Michelle Yeoh, what a star, her career is making a come back and this film is proof that she is deserving of it.

Great cinematography and film sets. I loved how the film majorly took place in about 6-7 rooms in total but it felt far more than that.

Such creative ideas for all the fight sequences and designs. When it comes to the story it starts off making you think it is just another typical storyline, the big bad wants to kill the main character. But it turns Into something far more powerful.

9.0/10 from me.",10
20 December 2022,The best movie of the year,"2022 has almost come to an end and Everything Everywhere All At Once is without doubt my favourite movie of the year. A24's new masterpiece definetly deserved the hype. It ranges from hilarious to extremly emotional. It is the funniest comedy of 2022 whilst also being a wonderful story about a small family. The action scenes are incredible and the music is used very well.

In addition, it is definetly the most creative movie I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is awesome. In my opinion, Michelle Yeoh should be nominatet for best actress.

The multiverse is handled much better than in other movies that came out this year (e.g. Dr. Strange). The attention to detail impressed me as well as the wonderful use of colour and sound.

Unfortunatly, the plot in the second half of the movie is not as focused as it is in the first one.

Nevertheless, the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat until the credits roll.

After Swiss Army Man I had very high expectations and I am happy to say that the Daniels easily subverted them.",9
20 May 2022,Take a peak at the Bagel,"Finally saw this film after a long wait, firstly Michelle Yeoh should be nominated for an Oscar and Stephanie Hsu for best supporting role.

Maybe i've consumed too many sci-fi films and it take something utterly strange to peak my interest, however, despite the films plot having a sense of familiarity, there's a ton of originality to scratch the itch of a long-time sci-fi fan.

It's not all action tho, a good chunk of the film is a touching story of family and acceptance of one's reality and choices.

3 January 2023,2 hours of Martial Arts in the Multiverse; Brilliant Last 20 Minutes & Michelle Yeoh,"You have to get through the first 2 hours of Martial Arts in the Multiverse to get to the last brilliant 20 minutes of Everything Everywhere All At Once. But in the end, it all makes sense and ties things together. Fun seeing Jamie Lee Curtis in the role of the IRS Agent. I had no trouble in 1 viewing of the film understanding its general concept of family and the conflict that often exists between Mothers and Daughters. Might require a 2nd viewing to figure out some things I may have missed in the movie's first 2 hours. Michelle Yeoh as the Matriarch is outstanding, she carries the full intensity of the film with Oscar-caliber accomplishment.

By far the best movie I have seen in 2022. The camera-work and editing is also highly creative and well executed.

15 March 2023,"I enjoyed it, but the plot could be better","I loved the effects, acting and the concept for this movie. However, when you see a movie that introduces you to a new concept, the beginning of the movie is discovering the concept, and the end is putting that into play with the main plot. For this movie, it feels a bit like it never gets out of the concept stage, then when it finally starts making progress on a plot, I wasn't particularly invested in it. I enjoyed the characters, all are wonderfully created and portrayed by the cast, but there could have been more done with the story. I recommend watching this, the jokes, the effects, the talent and the concept are all spectacular, but don't expect much in the plot. I finished this movie wanting more, but not a longer movie, just one with a better version of the plot, I am okay with a simple plot, but this plot was uninteresting and I didn't feel like very much had happened after all that work throughout the movie.

1 March 2023,Black Hole Bagel,"This is the most perfect example of a movie made especially for ADHD kids who are unaible to focus more than a minute on anything relevant. They're probably even totally into this kind of brainwash movie, because they think it's the coolest thing they've ever seen.

You're wrong! Be warned! For people who prefer to use their brains instead of leaving them outside at the popcorn shop this is just the latest offence to any intelligence, in case some of it is left after you have been able to watch this thing in full length.

Technically it might be an achievement, actors are as usual unimportant in such a mess, maybe with the exception of Jamie Lee Curtis, it's unbearably silly and the only content being delivered is: Be kind and love one another!

23 April 2023,Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) Review,"Rewatched March 16th, 2023

Even better this time around!!! The Daniels are geniuses. How much is going on in this film is insane. But that's kind of the point of the film: trying to get through all the chaos and noise of our lives to get to what is important, our families. And the Wangs definitely felt like a family, because not everyone gets a long all the time but in the end they do love each other and will do anything for each other. I love that the initial conflict was set with the IRS because many would related to what the characters are feeling in that time.

The acting from everyone was phenomenal. Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis all deserve their Oscar wins, and Stephanie Hsu (with a deserving Oscar nomination as well) and James Hong are excellent as well. Now I love Curtis's win (especially for her career), but after this viewing I do agree that Hsu's performance was far stronger. You can feel how passionate this film is to the Daniels so the fact that they won the Oscar's for directing and original screenplay is very deserving. The editing is out of this world so was a much deserved win at the Oscars. I remembered the costumes the first time around and was so happy that it got a nomination for it, and this viewing showed me again how amazing they were (I really would have loved to see a win here as well but I guess I can't have everything üòâ). The nominations for original score and song were very inspired, and I paid attention more to them this time around: very nice indeed. Its deserving Best Picture prize at the Oscars along with its other wins broke some stats: Yeoh became first Asian to win Best Actress, first film to win 3 acting awards and Best Picture, and its 7 wins made it the most awarded Best Picture winner since Slumdog Millionaire in 2008.

At the beginning I said the Daniels are geniuses, one thing to leave you with is that they were able to get me to cry when a rock ""goes after"" another rock....üò≠",10
18 May 2022,The bagel will tell you the real meaning of things,"Some things matter.

I have had high hopes for this film and got more than I hoped for.

It's hard to go on and analyze this film since the title gives you a short summary. It's a lot and the most essential things simultaneously. Everything is complicated, but all makes sense when you think of it simply.

As for the technical part, the production, acting, and humor, everything was just done the right way.

Yet the best thing is that you can relate. It shares its emotions with you. No more words - give it a try. It's a great film.

20 March 2023,An utterly fantastic and relevent movie,"What starts off as a quick trip to the IRS quickly spirals into an adventure involving multiple universes and the internal battle of absurdism and nihilism.

The movie is extremely easy to enjoy on a surface level. It has a lot of fun, snappy action, typical of that seen in Jackie Chan or Matrix movies. There's a plot at least in part based in generational trauma, and the acting is superb. The way the multiverse (as annoying as Marvel had made that term) is used makes for a lot of fun and interesting scenes, as well as the kind of drama one goes through when thinking about where their life could've gone had they just made this or that choice.

The real profound thing of the movie however is the battle of absurdism (or existentialism, depending on who you ask) and nihilism. It's the battle of ""life is meaningless"" vs ""you create your own meaning."" It's the difference between a life devoid of purpose and a life enjoyed with those around you. It's the difference of a crushing void and a blank canvas. And this movie is the journey of how one would grappel with the weighing thoughts of nihilism, only to be set free with the philosophy of existentialism.

You may not think it's a very complex subject, but it's not one touch upon often by movies, and the number of low scores on this site calling it ""meaningless"" only goes to show just how many (and I hate to be this guy) don't get the movie.",10

30 May 2022,Best film of 2022?,"It says alot that in the midst of Marvel mania with recent titles such as dr strange and spiderman this film by studio A24 stands out as one of the best in recent times maybe even the best of this year. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a fun multiversal movie full of colour and comedy this film had some truly comdeic moments being and yet kept an emotional story throughout that can truly make you feel for its cast of characters. The story does a great job of setting up each characters story and manages to make sense throughout despite trying (and succeeding) to set up its multiversal rules aswell as a great story and each character in its 2 hour and 20 minute. It is a must watch for evryone this year.

20 February 2023,Style over substance,"A thoroughly fun and entertaining movie, beginning to end, but lacks depth. The core of the movie is a pretty cliched story, treading on very, very well-worn ground.

It tackles a lot of big, weighty questions: the significance of our lives in an uncaring universe, midlife crisis, generational differences/overbearing parents, etc. But doesn't seem to have anything new or interesting to say about any of them. It just tells the same basic story with a new and flashy sheen.

The humor is also hit or miss. It takes a lot of shots and some certainly land very well, but much of it also is in the ""OMG RANDOM!!1!one!"" school of humor, which I find grating but may work for others.

The action choreography was very well done, and all of the fight sequences were a blast.

I'm also not a big fan of it pushing certain stereotypes, such as small business owners talking trash about their customers whenever they're speaking in their native language.",6
20 May 2022,Wow...,"People were raving about this film and seeing it now I can see why. I was very pleasantly surprised to enjoy this film as much as I did. As far as I knew it was a weird multiverse film but it was so much more. As I was watching and quarter of the way through it I was like damn this is weird this can't be a masterpiece surely (not in a bad way just weird). I don't mind being proved wrong sometimes. Not only is the movie about the multiverse but also about emotions and family. Michelle Yeoh was great in the movie along with her on screen husband and daughter. The film makes you relate on levels with all three characters and feel what they feel. It's a very deep film that will make you think hard after about what you saw and how you feel about it, in my personal opinion you could learn some lessons from this film about life. It's so unique and stands out from any other film it's guaranteed to make you think and feel something. The visuals in the movie are also stunning it's an absolute visual feast! So the end of the movie, after watching the main character jump universes and kick ass, the end of the movie was so unexpected. I really did not expect the movie to hit me so hard. Probably the most I've cried in a cinema, tears going down my face as I was watching it all unfold with the emotions with the characters and hitting me so hard even when I don't relate with everything it is just so human which was so surprising going into the film. Definitely check out this one for sure cause you'll get something out of it.",10
13 July 2022,Last 30 minutes was enjoyable.,"Pretty long, messy, and was hard to keep my attention. I almost turned it off multiple times. I almost took my mother to see this. We would have had to walk out. Last 30 minutes of the film hit me pretty good, and that's why it gets a 6. The rest didn't make up for it.

The Acedamy has lost its credibility and it's been happening more frequently for years now even on the small screen with the commercials on tv which target certain criteria i will refrain from getting into.

There was a time best picture was actually best picture or at least considered a true contender that was B. P. worthy however we live in a completely different era where hidden agendas are the new norm and making sense no longer matters.

I love all kinds of films however in my opinion this was more like a task waiting for it to end than a joy to watch nor appreciate.

I was blown away.

Watching it seriously, trying to understand and comprehend everything - this is completely different movie.

I don't know what more to say without spoiling the movie. This movie is just really just one masterpiece. The acting, the humor, the plot, the fighting scenes.... and it's clever too!

I laughed out loud many times troughout the movie and most of the time comedy movies won't even help with that. This is easily top 10 movies I've ever seen!

10 May 2022,Kinda Interesting but a bit messy and long,"I would say that this movie tried to include too many interesting ideas and clich√© tropes without focusing on anything long enough to give it any depth. The actors are very good but a lack of development undercuts the story. The tone is a mess. Is the movie a family drama, sci-fi horror, action movie, comedy, or an utter farce? The movie tries to include them all and as a result parts or bloated and the runtime is far too long. I enjoyed watching most of the movie but it is far from great. ""Too many notes""

The emotional parts really got me to fall in love with this movie. Not a movie you expect to make you tear up but it definitely had me. All the performances from the cast were exceptional. I hope to see them in more films. This movie does odd and weird amazingly. It keeps you engaged the entire 2 hours and 19 minutes. A lovely and heartwarming story and message is tucked into an action packed comedy and they did it so well. I'll recommend this movie to basically anyone it was PERFECT.

11 March 2023,Didn't do me like others.,"Ok so I will talk about small things that happen in the movie but not spoilers.

I came to this movie late as it had just cleaned out all of its awards and finally thought that I had to. It's good. The camera work is fantastic and style is remarkable. It did small things really well that producers like Disney try and fail at.

For instance: There is a female guard in one scene, this is good diversity as in real life, but where other movies would have the male protagonist and female security guard not technically strike each other, the male character smash's her. THIS IS GREAT! I woman in that position would be in line for physical altercations and dives right in. Most directors and produces want there cake (to include the female guard) and to eat it to (no fighting with the female guard). This is realistic and makes the whole situation believable.

This is one example of small things similar that happen over and over again. It is eerily close to real life which I don't think I've seen depicted in a ""sci-fi"" movie.

Unfortunately for what ever reason it just didn't do me like everyone else. As stated above it's fantastic and was very existential which critics love, i just finished the movie and started watching YouTube... no affect left.

It's a good movie but personally I wouldn't rate it any higher than 6/10 as I feel that it's lack of impact on me (a business owner and parent) is the point of art.

I am glad that it is getting rewarded as it is intelligent and has all the progressiveness of the best producers out there with out the ""eye role"" moments.

I recommend if you like time travel, sci-fi, alt-reality type stuff.",6
18 May 2022,"What a ""Joy"" to watch!","I have been a fan of Michelle Yeow ever since Wing Chun. That being said, this film was PHENOMENAL! I remember seeing the preview for it and thought ""hmm, this looks interesting"" then I totally forgot about the film until I saw it. If you're someone who is fascinated with the possibility of there being multiverses, this is the film for you. I don't understand all the 1 star reviews. Reading them just makes me think those people just hate any movie. Anyways, one of the scenes in the movie was just like a scene in Kung Fu Hustle and I really enjoyed that. Bravo to everyone who was involved in making this film!

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I honestly don't think I've ever been so mad at myself for wasting 2+ hours of my life watching this garbage, hoping that at some point it will get better but only gets increasingly weirder and worse as the movie goes on. And how on earth did these actors win most of the acting awards?! They were simply not good, not believable, I didn't care about any of the characters. I just wanted it to end. I think at times it was supposed to be funny but it doesn't wasn't. This movie is just plain dumb.

It's the same time a great, time traveling adventure, with a bonkers plot, comedy, and some truly insane sci-fi concepts, but, most importantly, it's about love, caring about the most important people in our lives, the tiny moments, that make up our most memorable memory, and, at the end of the day... depression.

Joy is depressed, she's overwhelmed, she's lost, and for most of the movie, the most important person in her life, her mom, doesn't seem to even care, or even acknowledge her presence sometimes. It's imo, an allegory for how we are constantly splitting our focus in a dozen different stuff nowadays, tying to be everywhere, but ending up been nowhere. She is stressed, and out of her mind, that she doesn't even realize what her daughter is going through. And, in a metaphorical way, she needs a interdimensional being to cross the multiverse, for her to finalize realize, she's losing her kid and to help her.

Of course, she doesn't do it alone, and, in figure of the father, Waymond, she learns that, she has to stopping fighting people, stop trying to change people, and actually, just be kind and give your love to the ones who need it, however they might need.

So, this movie is great, I loved it, as you might have noticed. It's so smart, funny, and out of the box completely with its concept, it's breaking of the fourth wall of sorts, and playing with the audience expectations a little bit too. Everyone is great in it, specially Stephanie Hsu and Key Huy Quan, who have to play multiple versions, completely different, from the same character, and they nail every single one of them. Michelle Yeoh is also really solid here, with by far the best performance I have seen from her.

Anyways, I love how it shines a light on mental health. And, at the end of the day the message is that the world is crazy, and most days, it probably doesn't make much sense, but... so what? We should enjoy the moments that do make sense, and share the found memories we have with our love ones.

To sum up, Everything Everywhere All At Once, is a great movie, with a complex story, with some serious underlining themes going on, if you want to see it, but at the same time, manages to be a crazy, and innovative movie about multiverses, with great action scenes, production value, and creative. Loved it, and highly recommend watching it. I would sum it up as Pixar movie, but in live action, and that, for me, it's one of the highest complements I could give a movie.",10
3 May 2022,"Genius! No, really, genius!","Where to start with this masterpiece!!! You laugh hard, you cry loud, you think deep and you get a visual array. I still don't know what this movie was about but I can tell you what it's about! Family values, personal strengths and hurdles, heart ache, love story, fantasy and journey. This is what the world needs after covid, something that pushes the boundaries of all things left and right with balance. People and friends have asked me what is it about and the only answer I give, and in awe, is - ""Everything Everywhere All at Once."" A - MAY - ZING.

12 April 2022,In Contention for the Best Movie of the Millennium,"As. Advertised. This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.

It has everything you want in a movie: action, humor, strong interpersonal relationships, and an absolute feast for the eyes.

There are a couple moments where if have Purtannical sensibilities, this movie is probably not going to be for you. Otherwise, enjoy the ride. It's Matrix meets Ladybird meets Scott Pilgrim meets Rumble in the Bronx.

A loveletter to possibility.

18 September 2022,"First Half Terrific, Second half Boring","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

5 July 2022,A Philosophical Art Dramedy of Matrix + Cloud Atlas + Sorry To Bother you,"Well.... What did I just watch here?

.... That's certainly what a lot of people will be feeling, after seeing this movie...no..sorry... ""Piece of art"" I should say, that meets silliness on an abstruse level. Rarely did I ever experience such an emotional rollercoaster, where it goes from silly stupid joke, to intense philosophy, back to an obscene joke, reverts back to social criticism, building up an intense emotional fraction, just to rip you out of this again with a dumb joke.

I love movies, that are dark sheep, disguised in Pikachu yellow cotton candy, so you really need to wait for some fine British drizzling, to see the actual dark core of the satire here.

The chemistry that Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh have is simply amazing and I would be VERY surprised NOT to see her winning an Oscar for this, even though dramedies tend to get robbed at the Oscars! This goes as well for an INSANE amount of editing work, that needs to be appreciated. With only 2h17 runtime it does feel almost twice as long though, which is not a bad thing, it is a long journey! You could probably write your master thesis in philosophy and social psychology completely based on those two hours, there is so much you could write about this, but I'll end it here, just go and watch it for yourself and form an own opinion.

This is the most bizarre movie you have seen in the last decade or so and the bold level of abnormality this movie delivers, while still being so meta....that's simply an accomplishment of art!",9

31 December 2022,"Genius, Brilliant... Film of the Year","This film, very unexpectedly, blew me away. In one fell swoop, it also ends all multiverse story lines Hollywood can ever come up with, and forever will be number one in it's field. It's that good.

I will not and cannot tell you the plot, you'll have to experience it yourself. But I can tell you this film is about love, regret, making peace with one's choices, and also... taxes. And it does so in the most absurd, endearing and laugh-out-loud way possible, kung fu style, in a freaking launderette.

Quick fire on the production: it's top notch, the special effects are bang on point, the performances could not have been better but most of all, the editing is beyond fantastic.

I laughed, cried, then absolutely bellowed from all this awesomeness. I cannot wait to see what this production team comes up next. Do yourself a favor and take one good decision in this universe: go for it. Hands down, film of the year.",10
2 October 2022,Comedic and humbling,"Although having an inherently positive and humbling message that in life, however meaningless, there can be found meaning through love it can be a little cringey at points. Visually, through multiple scenery and costume channels, the film is amazingly beautiful. It slightly feels that character development could be a little more interesting at times, but, they are indeed relatable to the everyday viewer. Various stimulating action points through martial arts stunts keep the easily distracted viewer intrigued and connected to the basic, yet sometimes confusing, storyline of the film and the individual characters within. Overall, although at points one may cringe, the comedic elements, and substantial message, power the individual viewer's enjoyment.

6 February 2023,Emperor's new clothes!,"Could be a student's thesis!

Very bad. Emperor's new clothes. People just admire things they don't understand. An insult to audience. Stupid premise, awful actings, mediocre direction and disoriented screenplay. And come on! Eleven Oscar nominations? You must be kidding me. I'm just wondering if they were on drugs making this film. Just like Hereditary and Midsommar it's another pointless art house movie from A24 company just to waste your time! The only A24 films that I liked are X and its prequel Pearl. Nonetheless, it has become apparent to me that every film from A24 is pretentious and unwatchable. 3/10, barely!

24 September 2022,"It's ok if you don't like it, this film doesnt matter to you","I knew very little about this film before watching it, all I knew was that it starred MIchelle Yeoh as a woman who learns about multiple universes containing multiple versions of herself.

I'm a big fan of Michelle Yeoh, so I was keen to see her in a film that was so unlike anything else I had seen her in.

Eventually I found myself in the right mood to watch a multiverse film, and oh my lord I'm glad I did.

I knew this film would be about roads not taken, about choices and consequences and about our personal insignificance amongst our reflections, it's what we expect from ideas that revolve around the multiverse.

What I didn't expect was a film that explored the nihilism that the multiverse concept evokes, a film that challenges that nihilism in the most beautiful way by saying ""if nothing matters, then all that matters is what matters to you"".

I need to explain here: My mother recently passed away unexpectedly, and I have found myself drained of everything except nihilism and anger, nothing mattered and I hated the world for pretending that it did.

This film threw my own nihilism in my face and made me look at it with the character of Jobu, a personification of nihilism/sadness/rage.

And as I watched the film I nearly fell into it, I nearly fell into the same logical pit of pointlessness. But just before I did, the film offered me a lifeline in the form of an idea:

If Evelyn can choose what matters to her, if she can choose to find significance in the connections and compassion of her loved ones and their lives together, why can't I?

This is the message in the film that resonated with me, but read these reviews and see the other messages that resonated with other people. See how other people choose/find significance in the nihilistic chaos and how it is different for each one.

For some people the message was about the selfishness of our world/culture today, with a message of hope that we are all human, all with our struggles and successes and a reminder that kindness breeds kindness.

For others the message was that when we are spiraling out of control with too many things to think about or focus on, focusing on one thing that truly matters to us can help us regain our control and find some peace/power in our lives.

See people choosing what mattered to them.

TLDR:

First, this is a film that requires you to be in a receptive/reflective frame of mind to enjoy it fully, if you aren't there or not that sort of person then you probably won't enjoy it as much ( I am so glad I waited until I was in that frame of mind).

Second, Everything Everywhere All At Once will ask you questions, the answers you find will probably change your way of looking at the world and yourself.

Third, even if the film doesn't connect with you on a deeper level, the comedy, action, and dialogue are all top notch and I would recommend the film on those alone.

Nothing matters, but it's ok, because it doesn't matter.",10
12 April 2022,My first review on IMDB,"I usually only rate titles on here for the algorithm recommend me things I haven't seen yet. I felt boarder-line euphoric leaving the theatre after all the emotions this film made me feel. Go to your theatre with an open mind, embrace the chaos and enjoy.

24 March 2023,Every genres movie,"When you discover the concept of meta verse and find that you can access memories, feelings and abilities of other selves. When everything in life goes wrong with her business, husband, son and father the actress still gets pressure from the IRS for suspected fraud.

The multiverse concept doesn't look for logic, the film defies the normal of a film with a beginning middle and end, without any restriction on what can or cannot be explored with the most diverse action scenes where you go from one to a completely different one. Which makes for a rewarding experience.

All in all, it is not just a fiction or a comedy because it goes through different genres and leaves its mark on each.

8 July 2023,Much Ado About Nothing,"This movie is just fine.

A lot o nonsense, funny sometimes, extravagant other times, but a complete waste of time.

I really didn't finish watching it properly. And I really had my hopes up for this to be an unforgettable movie...but it will be very forgettable.

I only gave it a 6 because of the actors.

Again, I don't understand the high ratings and high praises that it had.

It doesn't even led me to keep watching ""just to see what happens next"".

This could be similar to ""The secret life of Walter Mitty"", which I would rate higher than this.

I'm writing this as the final scenes roll out on the tv in the background.",6
16 January 2023,It made me feel all the feels.,"Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. It made me feel all the feels. There so much to this movie. Evelyn and Joy relationship. The relationship with Evelyn and Gong. The relationship with Waymond. Even the relationsonship with Evelyn and Deirdre. Must people could find one of those to relate to.

The acting is GREAT. If you like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" meets ""The Matrix"". I would probably like it. The editing, the writing and the jokes. Are all on point. I can see why some viewers would give it a 1 star. It wouldn't be everyone's type of movie. If you watch it. Just have fun. Its not everyday you will see those type of movie. The Rock scene is great.

27 July 2022,An awesome way of telling a simple story.,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of those films where its style over substance, don't get me wrong I think the movie is good, but only that...good, with potential to be great! But it missed the mark for me a little bit, I didn't really care about the characters as we spend minimal time building them so it was hard to feel that deeper connection with them.

The visual effects and cinematography with some aspects of the screenplay were the best I've seen in a movie in the last couple years. It was really great to see such strong Asian actors kill it on screen with the long awaited Ke Huy Quan who was one of my favorite child actors playing Data on the Goonies and James Hong who I don't think I've seen I film from him since Big Trouble In Little China and last but 100% not least Michelle Yeoh who gives an absolutely stellar performance through-out the entire film, even going back to her kung-fu roots which I'm sure was a great sight to see for any kung-fu film fan me included.

What I didn't like about the film is all the answers are just given to the viewer, no room for the viewer to figure things out on their own. Some scenes didn't feel genuine and the script is quite stilted in some scenes, the pacing could have been better but its an a24 film so i guess that's expected .

BUT all in all its a good film with potential to be great.",6
5 February 2023,Still laughing after this meaningless absurdity,"I read the raving reviews, then I watched the trailer and thought this isn't for me. But I was still curious after the great ratings on both IMDB and RT.

...And I just finished watching it. Oh, my. I think I'm living in the hipster-verse, where we absolutely need a movie like this to make a big, flashy statement of superficial hipster quotes: ""love is love"" and ""please accept your children for who they are"" and my all-time favourite: ""be kind, you don't know what the other person is going through"".

I think the writers took some tik-tok messages, added some kung-fu moves, and made a 2 hour film. I'd prefer the 1 min tik-tok messages any day, they'll save me time.

The acting is great of course (thus the 3 stars, one for each protagonist), but the scenario, writing, concept is pure cringy crap. But I get why all the great reviews and why probably this movie will win Oscar awards: because actual good american movies are dead. It seems now movies & critics reviews are made by people who are so out of sync with their emotions and relationships to others, they need to state the obvious, and claim they made art out of this.

Which reminds me of an ""artist"" who sold his invisible statue for 18,000. That's exactly how I feel about this movie. Like I spend my time to watch nothingness.",3
26 April 2022,Mind blowing,"This movie was done SO WELL. It was thought provoking AND had a fantastic family message. It's definitely for adults and not for young children - but as a parent this movie really got to me. It was done so beautifully. Best movie of the year!

25 February 2023,Future Nostalgia in a Chaotic Universe,"I remember coming into the cinema with high expectations. I had avoided the trailers like the plague for a blank canvas experience. And it just blew me away.

The editing and storytelling in this movie is incredible! The story is chaotic but fast paced and has just enough of a red thread to keep you hooked.

The chaotic energy feels like a longform improv theatre show where you never know what to expect and random ideas keep making this universe you've been invited to more and more layered.

The use of VFX feels fresh and creative. Watch the interviews with the Daniels - hearing them explain the VFX creation added another round of enjoyment and reminds me of a time when VFX were a more creative exercise than just overlaying CGI.

The performances are great! It is so lovely to see Michelle Yeoh brought to the spotlight she has always deserved.

Everyone in our group of friends was feeling inspired after the film, even though we all focused a slightly different aspects of it. Wonderful cinematic experience!",10
24 May 2022,Better than multiverse of madness,"""Every new discovery is just a reminder were all small and stupid""

Great movie, possibly the best I've seen since Covid, I truly wished it was on cinema's here so I could've enjoyed the amazing cinematography and background music but Sadly I didn't, but for sure of one of the cinema's buy it i will see it again!

The characters are lovely, even that taxes lady I actually didn't hate! The story kinda wrapped itself in the beginning and opened in the second half of the movie and in between the process left me mind blown.

The scene fights are hilarious? I know you're not suppose to laugh but I couldn't help myself, because there's a mix of everything in the movie that in a way you cant actually control your feelings and emotions.

Maybe the only flaw is that i felt some boredom after 45 minutes? I dont know im not the one to judge watching the movie on my TV screen but what i know for a fact is this movie is a MUST watch!",9
7 April 2023,21st century Jackie Chan,"This movie can be interpreted in two very different ways: 1) A mother trying to cope with her difficult life, strange relation with her too original husband, and especially her sour relation with her only 20 or so year old daughter, and who goes through long hallucinations of an imaginary world with parallel universes; or 2) A science fiction movie where parallel universes are created every time a decision is made, with copies of yourself in each one of them (somewhat like the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics), and where good and bad affront each other (like in bad blockbusters). The viewer will have a difficult time deciding.

All this would be OK if it were not for the three-quarters of the movie being, admittedly well choreographed, Bruce Lee / Jackie Chan type of martial art infighting between the protagonists and their immediate surroundings. The movie would have been considerably better with 3 to 5 times less fights.

Otherwise, the acting is superb. There are some excellent moments, like the elevator scene or the scene on the top of the cliff.",6

The Daniels have probably just invented a new movie genre, that not many people will dare to touch. The many interesting plot points are what brings this movie to life. The amazingly edited fight scenes are well done to say the least. The cast is also wonderful. I loved seeing Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, James Hong and Ke Huy Quan's breathtaking performances. I will say, I love Jaime Lee Curtis' other movies, but this wasn't her best work. She was still amazing, but her character should have got more screen time. EEAAO is a very crazy movie that will make you question some things. Chilling dialogue beautifully corresponds with the characters they were put with. Definitely watch this movie, as it is one-of-a-kind,

29 April 2023,Stopped watching after 34 minutes,"It is really bad and annoying. At 30 minutes we decided to give it another 15 minutes, maybe it will turn out good or at least better. After 4 more minutes we gave up. I haven't seen such a bad movie in years. Maybe if you can struggle through, there will be some meaning. But it is really really unbearable. I have no idea why it has 7.9 stars here and how it won so many Oscars.

Now I'm jus writing to hit the min characters required. So the rating is only about the first 34 minutes. If the rest is 10 stars (I doubt it), it might reach 7.9 on average. Still 44 characters to go. It is bad, bad, bad. Done. Don't spend money to rent it.

The exploration of unique multiverse concepts and unique themes about how each decision we make in life lead to big changes and there is a universe out there where your dreams have been achieved. It's inspirational stuff.

28 August 2022,I'm glad I stuck till the end,"I was reading a few minority reviews here about how confusing it is at the beginning and I totally agree, but you need to hold on to let the crazy parts go to experience the depth of the story. But isn't that how life is? This was thought provoking, full of weird humor that you can laugh off, and my god, the tears because the story in the end, how it all comes together is just beautiful. I could so relate to the mother-father love story and saying ""we always find each other"" and the mother-daughter relationship and unexpectedly I was in tears watching all this.

So pleaseeee, stick till the end, I promise everything will make sense.

9 February 2023,Almost Everything,"I must admit that I had no preconceived notion of the plot, so there was no layer of expectation guiding my viewing experience. What I did know was that the movie was being considered for several Golden Globe awards and starred a talented cast. I love Michelle Yeoh, the return of Data, Po's dad is always a joy, and the mom from Freaky Friday is my secret crush, what is not to like.

The minute Waymond, the young patriarch of the Wang clan, starts his parkour across the family-owned laundromat, the viewer gets a glimpse of the impending frenetic multiverse that guides the movie for the next few hours, helping it live up to its title... it really was everything, everywhere, all at once.

Throughout the movie, the director quickly and sometimes confusingly trapses through familiar plot elements that will resonate, if the viewer can pull back the curtain of the hyperactive and manic effort from the characters at play. We get glimpses of family strife, parental discord, personal discontent, disappointment, resignation, joy, redemption. To this concern, viewers, please be warned, in an effort to stay in line with the quick moving story or to just relive some of the more bizarre twists, you may need to be prepared with a thumb or forefinger ready on the pause, rewind, go back 15 seconds button. One might offer that it, in fact, adds another level to the multiverse experience. In the end, the movie slows down enough to allow the viewer time to catch-up with the plot and message before the credits roll.

For some this movie will be an exciting ride, one in which the viewer will spend with their hands in the air, exhilarated at every quick twist and turn. Amazed at the intense action fight scenes, giggling at the absurd and over-the-top visual elements chosen for various alternate worlds. For others, it will lack the needed depth to stay connected to the characters and storyline, instead wishing they could opt for an alternate universe in which the viewer decided to skip the movie and catch-up on some streaming binge worthy show.",6
12 June 2022,Strap in for a genre-bending thrill ride. A must-see for a million reasons.,"Pro's: Imagine a movie that has the imagination and mind-bending impossibilities of the Matrix, while also pulling off the reality-jumping acid trip of Dr. Strange. Well, we have one and it's called Everything Everywhere All at Once. It's hard to describe the movie without simply retelling the story, as it truly transcends any traditional film genre. It's not an action movie per se, but it's packed with action. It's not a family drama per se, but you'll feel shades of Beautiful Boy. It's not a comedy per se, but there are genuine laughs peppered in. The movie successfully rolls the best of all of these genres into one and executes. It's also wise enough to not get mired down in any one of the subplots. It keeps moving, often at breakneck speed, too busy warping through absurd and awesome scenarios to get stuck where lesser movies would. The action and effects are thrillingly done. The production value is blockbuster level, a fact quite astonishing considering a team of only 5 people produced all the digital effects for this film. There's a lesbian daughter, but at no time does it become a ""message movie"" about that. There's a predominantly Asian cast, but at no time does it harp on how ""important and brave"" it is to tell their story, it just simply tells it without patting itself on the back. The film falls for no traps, it's interested in the plot. The runtime is on the longer side at almost 2 and a half hours, not that you would ever know. It practically crashes and bashes through to the end once it takes off. A ton of thought was put into the visual design of the film, too much to go into here. But of note is the motif of circles, which appear all over the set and costume design, representing the ""too much-ness"" of everything happening everywhere all at the same time. The movie opens on the image of the family reflected in a circular mirror, the daughter's ""everything bagel"" is a black circle (echoed when Jaime Lee Curtis circles tax forms with thick black circles), googly eyes pop up on multiple surfaces including main character Evelyn's forehead. Even the family's laundromat is a room stacked wall to wall with the circular washer doors surrounding the characters. This attention to detail is present in everything, everywhere, in the film (pardon the pun). All performances are strong and well done. Veteran Michelle Yeoh's makes her stressed laundromat owner Evelyn a real person. And in a surprise comeback is Ke Huy Quan as dopey husband Waymond. You'll remember him from his 80's stint as ""token goofy Chinese kid"" in The Goonies and Indiana Jones. And the first half of the movie might have you thinking he's back now to simply put on his ""goofy Chinese man"" hat. But by the end of the movie he's delivered the most heartfelt moments to the audience, and expanded into a layered, wise character. Rarely does a film deliver on an interesting and inventive plot, thrilling action, and real drama in a way that lands without getting distracted with any of the aforementioned pieces. It's simply a treat.

Cons: There's not much to pick at here in terms of weaknesses. If we're feeling fussy I suppose there may be a consideration, not a plot hole, that could have perhaps led the characters to a solution a bit more expediently than they pursued. Without spoiling major plot points it involves the reality jumping aspect of the film and having access to all possibilities. It seems that maybe certain avenues weren't explored that could have been in order to solve their problem. However, we as the audience have the benefit of sitting back and thinking up scenarios and solutions. Without Monday morning quarterbacking, a different (possibly better) solution may not have occurred to us in the moment either, which the characters must live through in real time and don't get to sit back from removed from the scenario. Especially in a movie like this with the adventure whizzing by at lightning speed. One other, more legitimate, quibble has to do with the Matrix-esque skill acquiring Evelyn is able to do. From what the movie tells us, that should be perfectly possible mentally. But physically, it doesn't perhaps make immediate sense why her body itself would gain or lose functionality (floppy hotdog fingers and hulked-out pinky fingers, alternately). Played more for laughs here, but still. Something to consider.

Bottom line: This is without a doubt one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best movies of the last few years. Genres are blended and transcended with astonishing finesse. The action comes fast and creatively shot, the drama is grounded and real, it's funny when it wants to be and it will freak you out when it wants to get freaky. It's one of those movies you just have to see to experience this strange but effective blend. It's a little bit of everything, that will take the audience everywhere, all at once. 9.5 out of 10 stars.",10
21 May 2022,Just not for me but ...,"I didn't even look the score on rotten tomato but i just know they will give this movie 90+ % . If its about gey right and so, yep over 90% from RT They just support anything that involves gey people and understanding and mixed colors with emotions and so on... This movie is just big confusion maybe this is how it feels when you do drugs O. O ..

And one more thing that was amazing to me... Lo Pan is still alive !! Good God this man is Amazing. Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis amazing actors i watched this movie because of this 4 !

16 April 2022,Brilliant genre-blending cinema,"A Chinese family in America is disintegrating over the stresses from a strained marriage, generational differences, and looming tax issues with their small business, all overshadowed by the spectre of unfulfilled dreams. When the boundaries keeping the multiverse apart begin to collapse, however, all possible narratives begin to not just bleed together, but collide with spectacular effect - both cinematically and narratively.

This film reminded me of all the great reasons for being a cinema reviewer - not least opportunities like this, to get to see wonderful cinema before almost everyone else - and then write and publish exhortations to SEE THIS FILM!!

Not just for the spectacle - which is considerable - but also for a wonderful, heart-warmingly, human story of love and misunderstanding, that will have tears in your eyes even while you are laughing in disbelief at some of the colossally humorous and wickedly painful pratfalls that populate this enigmatic sci-fi-slash-martial-arts flick.

The cast were absolutely splendid and I loved absolutely all of the characters - however I will make special mention of both Stephanie Hsu, who was able to demonstrate a massive yet seamless range all within the same shot - in multiple scenes - and Jamie Lee Curtis, who brilliantly pulls off what is without doubt the strangest character portrayal of her career.

This is the best film I've had the opportunity to review in quite some time and I'm very keen to see how it fares in the awards season.

Bottom line: I thoroughly recommend you see this film, so you can decide for yourself whether it's worth the second viewing I know I'll be making.",10
25 May 2022,Acid trip to multiverse of absurdity,"So this is about a multiverse thats even more complex than comic movies' lol. I think this movie is not for everyone, though. Within the complex layers of trippy-ness and absurdity, the movie has really deep meaning.

With that said, for me, well, I got entertained on the first act, then it got REAALLY trippy and convoluted on second act, so at third act I just wanna see the closure and be done with it. Its so trippy that sometimes it gives me nausea effect, and the bizzareness and absurdity FAR outweigh the film's overall feel, even though I get what the film is trying to say.

So.. what's my final take on this film? All the actors played here gave great, ..no, superb performances. Film's message was great. Visuals and art direction were great. But it's still very hard to rate this movie. A part of me wants to rate it 9, but also wants to rate it 3 at the same time. I like it, but at the same time, not really. So.. at the end, I feel like this really isn't my jam, definitely wont ever rewatch it, even though I do like and appreciate some parts of it, especially the film's message.

Rate: not for everyone/10.",6
30 January 2023,NOT what I was told,"I was told by both reviewers here and professional critics that to GET ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" I had to stick it out until the end. Even if you WANTED to turn it off after a half-hour or an hour, you couldn't, because you wouldn't understand the film's point. So, I sat through the ENTIRE film, credits included in case there was one of those little scenes at the end of them telling me that everything I'd just watched was a dream or something. But, no, there was nothing. I won't even go into the plot because umpteen reviewers here have already done that. But I will say that in the world of ""over-hype,"" this film is in the Top Ten. If you feel like you HAVE to see it before ""Oscar's Big Night,"" I suppose you must, but if you're reading this after the Oscars, even if this film wins Best Picture, don't bother. The ""message"" of the film is simplistic, and frankly, too little and too late. It will not change the world as much as the screenwriters and filmmakers may want it to. I'm giving it a 5 for Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Ke Huy Quan. And James Wong is ALWAYS a welcome addition to any film, even one as overhyped and ultimately disappointing as this one. On to the next nominee...",5
13 August 2022,Brilliant!!!,"...absurd, awesome, beautiful, brilliant, crazy, hilarious, mystical, revelationist, sci-fi fantastical and totally original!!!

13 July 2022,"Not perfect, not for everyone, but definitely an experience!","This is a film unlike no other, it's up to you to decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

In my case I absolutely loved it, the humor landed with me every time there was a joke and the heartfelt moments were tastefully done in my opinion. The characters are there and they aren't just empty vessels for the action, the main characters all get fulfilling character arcs and even side characters get to have their own backstories developed a bit across the multiverse!

There are a ton of little cues, details and foreshadowing that pop up upon a rewatch and to someone like me who loves rewatching the movies I like, it adds a ton of value and makes for a better experience.

The movie is weird and convoluted, hard to follow at times and at some points I heard people near me in the theater say: ""What are we even watching?"" However if you're able to embrace this uniqueness and immense creativity, it becomes an experience like no other. So many things happen during the runtime of the film that there's always something to love, and you'll come out with several memorable moments to joke about.

The title Everything Everywhere All at Once describes the viewing experience perfectly. Some might hate it or feel overwhelmed, I loved it start to finish, nonetheless it is undeniable that its a unique experience and for this reason I consider it a must watch.",10
26 May 2022,"The Multiverse We Needed, The Multiverse We Deserved","""Of All The Places I Could Be, I Just Want To Be Here With You""

I for one, generally refrain from using the phrase, the word, ""Masterpiece"" in my assessments of movies; simply cause it's a medium of artistic expressions, and therefore it is very much subjective, so using such a generalized term would pose a few questions against the very conception of having subjective viewpoints. However, in this case, I would like to make a rare exception by citing ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" as a Chef-d'oeuvre, a Masterpiece.

Not only the concept but the entire demonstration is on a whole another level. Never in my wildest imaginations did I think something like this could ever possibly exist, let alone anticipate. It's just so terrifically done, almost too perfect to believe if any of this was real, or was It all a dream? With great characters, a magnificent screenplay, and scintillating technicalities; It has got everything a movie fanatic would wholeheartedly cherish, mark my words, in the time to come, this will eventually become a cult classic, that would have the power to inspire thousands of other movies.

I'm not even exaggerating when I tell that I can't point out any single flaw in it, let alone any kind of inadequacy. The whole movie is just so flawless, like an immaculate endeavor, fraught with the potions of perfection and grace. Matter of fact, I never seen a movie celebrating and taking full advantage of its peculiarities in such an imperial manner. This will mesmerize and bind your conscience until the very last frame. It is very difficult to explain in mere words, what my mind wants to convey at this moment, it is something you need to experience by yourself, only then you would be able to witness what peak filmmaking really is.",10
21 May 2022,Bizarre love story of madness,"I don't think I understood it. I definitely wasn't high enough. It was too long. It was funny.

25 July 2022,Coulda Woulda Shoulda,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

18 May 2022,Oh My Godddd!,"Everything Everywhere all at once is phenomenal. During my watch, the movie has surpassed my expectations multiple times. The movie has shown stuff beyond my imaginations but also holding a deep emotional core of a storyline. My mind is blown.

For comparison, Multiverse of Madness does not even come close by a mile to 'Everything Everywhere all at once'.

11 June 2022,Way too long,"I think this movie is fine to watch at home where you can skip a bunch of cringe worthy parts and overly extended seizure inducing psychedelic visuals. It was exhausting to watch in a theatre and should have been half as long. The movie has its merits with funny moments but left me with a headache as I'm writing this.

7 May 2023,Nothing. Anywhere. Ever,"What an absolutely smelly pair of old pants on a stick. I'd love to be on the panel of judges that award the Oscars, because I'd whip them into shape. This film is boring, the characters are uninteresting and the story line a big yawn. The special effects are not even that special. The film is at least an hour too long (probably two if the truth be told). It's repetitive and not very clever. I love Jamie Lee Curtis, but she really didn't impress me in this. Is there a bias towards 'foreign' films as a backlash to all the 'me too' kind of sexism and racism? If so, then that might go some of the way towards explaining what happened here.

12 July 2022,Sometimes the hype is justified.,"I haven't seen a movie with this much thought, heart, and reverence in a long time. Nor a movie actually do gay representation without it making feel like minstrel show. This was great. A little bloated hence the 8/10 rating. The acting seemed good, but not great. I feel like Evelyn was kind of week at the very end, everyone else was good.

In a movie that normally is bloated when they literally try to do everything and try 100 different genres/art-styles, it helps when you have one basic message to structure everything. SO in the end it kind of get repetitive when you get the ""THEME"" of the movie, but it's done in such an enjoyable way, that you forgive the fact that it treats you like a child and repeats the message like 15 times which is how long they say with rote learning it takes to memorize something.

Was a great movie, could easily recommend and A24 is really cementing themselves as the new powerhouse for indie. I can't even remember the previous champ, but I do remember there was one, it wasn't Miramax... HMM who was it. EITHER WAY great script, great message, no tokens, and managed to be orderly yet chaotic.",8
27 December 2022,Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022),"Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022)

(8/10):Before the year closes out I thought I'd see what all the hype is about and it's warranted,fantastic film.

It's visually stunning and filled with so much creativity that it's concept could be milked for endless sequels,yet I'd prefer it as a standalone film.

It's got a great cast in Michelle Yeoh,Jonathan Ke Quan (most famous for his child roles as Short Round and Data),Jamie Lee Curtis and James Hong, who I absolutely adore.

My biggest issue with it is it's pretty long,being almost two and a half hours, but it's proof that originality isn't dead as it has enough ideas for one or two dozen different movies.

The acting is solid and the comedy sometimes hits its mark sometimes not, but comedy is not this film's strong suit,it's purely its visuals and seemingly endless amounts of ideas.

The film is separated into three parts or chapters which does help break down the pacing a bit,which is nice but it still started to feel a bit sloggish as if you're not completely down for the length of it and completely invested then it feels very much it's length and begins to drag about halfway in.

It's pace feels fast yet it still feels long.

Issues aside I think it's a very well made film that still feels like an indie project despite it having some big names and a big budget.

The fight scenes are very interesting and well choreographed and the costumes are excellent.

I think out of every movie I've seen to come out this year I'd recommend this one the most as it's fun, creative, original and a visual treat.",8
18 May 2022,"Laughed, cried, was amazed. This movie touched my soul","Saw this with my gf. Starts out simple enough, then things get crazy fast. Then things get hilarious. So much random stuff is thrown about, even R rated stuff. Yet despite all that, the core themes come across beautifully and masterfully. Family. Love. Forgiveness. Self Acceptance.

All the other stuff is dressing and entertaining as h*ll. Highly recommend this.

23 September 2022,Excruciating,"I never leave reviews for films on IMDb. I also never walk out on a film part way through. However, after spending 45 minutes trying to give this abomination of a film the benefit of the doubt, I just couldn't take anymore; hence me writing this review to warn others.

Here are a few words I'd use to describe this film:

Dull, repetitive, unoriginal, unfunny, confusing, chaotic...

I fell into the trap of thinking this film would be really enjoyable, given the critical acclaim received from critics and IMDb users alike. Please don't make the same mistake and waste 140 minutes (or however long you can tolerate) of your life on this trash.

30 March 2023,Loving each other and respecting each other's differences is not very difficult!,"We have a saying in Persian language that ""thorns turn into flowers by loving them"" and this beautiful movie was It was like this sentence. And it had the same message.

The analysis and message of this movie was very beautiful and the timing for the broadcast was perfect. And how beautifully it showed that old and absurd ways of thinking make you unable to love even your own child because of his difference, but how beautiful everything becomes with a change of perspective.

Being human, being kind, empathizing and helping each other in this world that has become a dirty political game of some politicians, is the only salve we can put on our wounds, because none of us will live forever.

4 June 2022,One of the best films I've ever seen.,"Don't listen to the negative reviews, most seem to be about length for some reason. I can see this not being everyone's cup of tea, a lot of people have bad taste, but to write a lengthy bad review for this is like criticising a solar eclipse.

I laughed, I cried, I left inspired. A cathartic and joyous experience unlike pretty much any other film you could see. The story is captivating, not a scene of hammy acting, stunning psychadelic effects, and it has perhaps the most heart of any sci-fi film ever made.

The only reason I would give this anything less than 10/10 would be to lower your expectations so that you were that little bit extra blown away by the experience.

I immediately started googling the directors/writers other work, and will be following their future releases keenly.

Do yourself a favour and watch this film. It's as close to a perfect movie as you can get.",10

18 February 2023,A must watch masterpiece,"This movie had so many twists and turns, it was an absolute joy to watch, an emotional rollercoaster. The whole movie you felt as if you were the one living it.

The cinematography was breathtaking, every scene felt unique, every transition flawless, every moment special. The people who worked on this movie really put blood sweat and tears into it and you can feel it throughout the entire film.

The movie has so much more depth to than it seems at first, it takes you on a wonderful ride with great acting, a breathtaking story and all in all feels very complete and well planned.

The only negative in the movie was I'd say some of the humor, it felt slightly forced but still none the less it is a must watch movie which might just help you search for a way to relate to some situation in the movie.

The movie told a lot of small stories in a very well designed manner.

4 March 2023,"Clever with superb acting, though overly long if message isn't new","The plot develops slowly then picks up speed. The film feels overly long from a plot development perspective, complex as it is it could have been covered quicker. The length at least gives the actors to display their immense talents in making the crazy situations credible, and adding the right amount of humour and pathos. However, I prefer a story that needs the length rather than padding to display the actors and editor's skills I see how some find the film engrossing in how it's message develops and the characters' realisations of it, but I found myself distracted. Maybe I've heard the message before and admire the presentation but feel little impact. For others I can see it is revelationary. Whoever you are the first 15 minutes drag so don't be put off by them.

24 May 2022,Unique amazing movie that should win all the Oscars,"This is one of the biggest surprises in Movie history for me. I had zero expectations, and I only watched this by coincidence but oh boy oh boy is this a marvellous piece of cinematic wonderfulness.

I only hand out 10s to the very best flawless movies and this is not that, however it comes darn close and this certainly deserves a 9/10. The main negative is that the production value is sometimes low, and a couple of times you can tell. Don't get me wrong, they do a fantastic job with a limited budget and this outshines all the superhero movies, but imagine what they could have done with double or tripple the budget? The only other ""complaint"" I have is that I want more. This should have been a 10 hours movie or a 10 seasons TV show and I would eat it all up. I feel a bit cheated that there is no more.

The movie is however pure brilliance. The acting is fantastic, the directing amazing, the story so unique and original that I hope all of Hollywood feel ashamed. Music and sound design is brilliant, and I cannot remember when I laughed and cried so much to a movie before. The emotions are strong with this one!

Fantastic movie that should win at least 5 Oscars, but I would not surprised if it wins more. Best movie of 2022 so far, and I hardly see any movie surpassing this. Absolutely stunning watch and I cannot recommend this enough. Go see! And see it again!",9
12 June 2022,Funny movie with some great scenes but not my cup of tea,"This movie is super funny and has a couple of extremely well-made cinematic scenes such as the mix of Evelyn's other identities during her universe jump. The black bagel is also a really interesting object. However, I found the meaning of the movie a bit lacking and it wasn't touching (that's what I look for in a movie vs. Purely entertainment).

15 January 2023,This could have been a great movie,"This could have been, and should have been, a great movie. It had all the right themes, a great cast, good direction but it fell down because of way too many fight scenes. Perhaps a movie with an underlying theme of the bond between a mother and daughter dosen't lend itself well to a Kung fu movie, perhaps it shouldn't be tackled by an all male team because the overabundance of fight scenes were really tiring if you're not a male comic book movie fan. I'm not but I thought I might like this movie anyway. I did like Black Panther, the action fit the movie, but this was trying to be all things to all people and it just didn't cut it. The one thing this movie reinforced was thar it might be better if women ruled the world as well as made more movies. There would be less superfluous fighting, more plot, and a shorter, but much better, movie.

14 March 2023,Fever Dream???????,"What did I just watch? Listen, I grew up in the 80's and I love to see the underdog win. I cried like a baby during all the winner's speeches. Then I figured let me watch the movie. Horrible. It was literally a fever dream. I don't understand the high ratings. The acting was very good, I'm not saying it wasn't but the movie made no sense and had no order. I came on IMDB to see if it was just me. Clearly it is not just me. A giant bagel? Fighting with your feet? An eye glued to the forehead? Talking rocks? Hot dogs? Did the writer just write down his experience on LSD? I don't know. I thought I've seen it all but clearly I was mistaken.

Michelle Yeoh gives a master class along with supporting actors bringing their very best. If you enjoy Krazy and cool movies. You might just enjoy this one. If you are more into the size of the magazine the bullets fit in. You may not. This one causes thinking so enter at own risk. Hope you dig it.

14 April 2022,Matrix - meets Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass - meets A Wrinkle In Time - meets Loki - meets Turning Red - meets Waking Life,"MY OVERALL TAKE: Overall #EverythingEverywhereAllAtOnce gives The Matrix - meets a matured Alice in Wonderland Through the Looking Glass- meets A Wrinkle in Time - meets the family relationship tension of Turning Red - meets Loki - meets Waking Life

I was excited for this film the moment I saw the trailer back in December (I believe), and it met the expectations I had for the most part..minus some of the comedic choices, which wasn't expected, but was much appreciated.

This is clearly one of the most unique and mentally stimulating films of the year (if not The most...), which means it probably already has award slots RSVP'd.

OTHER THOUGHTS:

Highlights: Where to begin! The visual effects and cinematography pairing was superb and genius for this story. I also loved the symbolism of the Evelyn and Waymond's relationship via Evelyn's uncertainty of the ""Waymond"" who was present at any given moment. The women all did an amazing job, but Stephanie Hsu was a standout.

Could've Been Better: Though easy to accept, I would've liked more space in Act One given to showcasing the tensions and traumas of the family, specifically between parent and child, and parent and parent. This could've strengthened some of the decisions of Acts Two and Three.",9
11 January 2023,AMAZING,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",10
16 October 2022,Hard to describe..,"I really don't know what I just watched, but it was so creativ, so original, so absurd, so funny and so serious. This movie lives up to its title, it really is everything, everywhere and all at once. Sometimes so much it was hard to proces it all, but I have never seen anything like it, and I don't know how a few people can come up with so many creative things at once. I mean a universe with hotdogfingers, fightscenes with large dildoes and a fanny bag, and all the other colorful stuff they managed to put in it.

This movie made me feel good, and I have a feeling that it's gonna be one I remember, thats why I gave it 10 stars.

3 April 2023,"Comedy in class with Ferrell, Sandler, or Stiller, not much more","Simply a comedy in the likes of Zoolander, Waterboy, Dodgeball, Anchorman, Dumb and Dumber. Or maybe a fast action romp like John Wick. A digital fantasy as Freeguy. One could be generous and say it is Annie Hall in being a comedy that fits the times. Crew deserves credit for editing and special effects.

Yeoh's acting is superior and brings likability to the whole family. But Jamie Curtis? That is an average role at best. And of course too long and often too immature butt plugs, almost feels like an insult.

EEAAO is not best movie material and watching it expecting such will bring disappointment. Much easier to enjoy if you begin viewing without the 7 Oscar winner quality assumption.

7 August 2022,Best film of 2022,"Everything everywhere all at once is a truly heartwarming film that surprised me with how hilarious it is. Wonderful cinematography from the get go. This film is very wacky and weird at times, so if you prefer a straight-forward plot, maybe this isn't the film for you. But for those who can sit back and enjoy the madness, give this film a go, you won't regret it.

22 May 2022,It was ok,"This has to be one of the most overrated films i have ever seen. Some ideas taken from Matrix, Inception, some original ones and here you are.

Make no mistake, this is a family movie. The sci-fi, the action, it is all very childish.

The fact that this movie is a 8.6 on imdb is mind blowing for me.

27 February 2023,Absolute Trash,"This pile of confusion, jumpcuts, and littered chaos doesnt have a single redeeming virtue that can qualify it to status of movie. The plot is a deadbeat trope of recycled conncepts and hacked notions scooped up by someone stepping out from 30 years of coma and having just finished watching a double feature of The Matrix and Multiverse of Madness.

It doesnt matter how many people pretend to like it or defend it by citing its nominations for awards, in truth we all know this fluff is bloated , poorly acted, unhinged, pretentious, uniteresting , bore, unwatchable and a complete waste of time and money.

Everything from the acting to the special effects to the amazing editing, and even the humor was hilarious. The main story was also very sad and made me want to tear up a bit.

I love this film a lot, and shows how different A24 films can be.

13 September 2022,perfect,"Perfect mix of familial drama, comedy but not too mutch it can be serious when the film need it to be and also a lot of KUNG FU !!.

Marvel movies should have looked like that instead of overdoing the jokes part and not being serious at crucial moment...

This film will make you laugh, cry and think. I love getting out and keep thinking of a movie i just watch even the next day or week. It's refreshing and i hope the producers will make more movies as good as this one for the futur.

For sure top tier for this year very refreshing and it hard to describe but it's everything everywhere all at once ;)

19 April 2022,Whats Walts Watching,"Thank god for subtitles in a universe where I don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese, but there is also plenty of English spoken.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" by the Daniels, Kwan and Scheinert is the most trippy movie I've ever seen and that's saying something.

I'm glad I was only on prescription drugs and multi-vitamins that night.

So many movies are referenced during the 2 hours and 19 minutes of screen time, including: Stanley Kubricks' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""The Matrix"", ""Groundhog Day"" & ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and Anime.

Imagine that you alone could save the world, but you can barely do your taxes or save your marriage and family.

The movie plays out like a book divided into 3 chapters.

The first is ""Everything"" and starts after the initial set up.

It's a great excuse to film the most brilliant choreographed fight scenes since Tarantinos' ""Kill Bill"" & ""Old Boy"".

Don't be fooled by the fake end credits after the first chapter wraps.

The second chapter is ""Everywhere"" and the final chapter is, you guessed it ""All At Once"" which features the denouement.

IMDb's synopsis refers to the films star Michelle Yeohs ""Evelyn Wang"" as an ageing Chinese immigrant"".

Fair suck of the sauce bottle IMDb we are all ageing, but this actor is only 2 years younger than this reviewer so please call her middle aged if you must!

Whereas the man who plays Evelyns father can wear that title of senior proudly.

James Hong as ""Gong Gong"" is one of the most prolific and well recognised Asian-American character actors of movies and television.

At 93, he is still actively working, mostly as a voice actor.

Essentially this film draws on a mother and daughters relationship/love which knows no boundaries.

Stephanie Tsu is perfect as Evelyns daughter ""Joy""...even though rapper/actress Awkwafina was tipped for this role.

One of my fave visual moments is ""the handshake"" between mother and daughter.

It's really the ideal Mothers Day movie.

Evelyns husband ""Waymond Wang"", Ke Huy Kwan, is better known for his work as a child actor ""Short Round"" in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""Data"" in ""The Goonies"".

In fact, its been over 20 years since he's appeared on the big screen and that was in ""X-Men"".

Jackie Chan was originally destined for this role.

Watchout for: Jamie Lee Curtis (""Halloween"") as an IRS agent with a Buddah belly who gets her tax cheats.

She apparently was the funniest actor on the set...even though Curtis only got to deliver serious lines.

One of the best scenes is silent and involves no spoken aloud dialogue, just superimposed lines from the two central characters...brilliant cinema.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is an insane, existential, comedic, adventure that is so close to perfect.

""Dr Strange"" is going to have a lot of competition from the visual stimulation that's both funny and at times sad in this low budget Multiverse movie even though they have the power of MCU versus just 25 million dollars and a handful of geeky tech people.

This movie will help you see meaning in a universe where you sometimes feel nothing matters.",9
23 May 2022,you had me at everything bagle,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

24 April 2022,Only Made an IMDB Account to review this powerhouse of a movie....,"I probably had the most fun in a theater ever watching this movie. The whole movie was just pure unadulterated joy and heart and it's safe to say that this is my nee favorite movie.

The Daniels keep pushing the boundaries in film making and you can tell that they have their own style by even comparing the movie to their previous endeavor, Swiss Army Man, which was also a solid film.

Easily one of the most unique, most innovative and the most thought provoking films I have seen in years.

The fact that it was an allegory of a family made it all the more powerful.

If this doesn't get all of the oscars there is something wrong with the film industry because MAN did this movie pack a punch. They wouldn't let you turn your head for a second, from the first plot twist to the final chaotic climax.

Please watch it in a theater!!!!",
15 May 2022,I saw everything all at once in the trailer,"If you saw the trailer you saw everything. There is not a single scene that is not in the trailer. I waited the whole movie to see something else, another form of her but nothing... sad.

The rest, it feels like 80% of the movie is talking about the gimmick and explaining what is going on. Show it and do not explain the whole movie!

I still had fun, but i wished it would have gone even more deeper and more mindfuck.

29 August 2022,Good Film but Trying too Hard,"This is a good film, technically it is well made but also the story is funny, the characters loveable and the plot engaging. It does feel like it's trying to hard at points though. Without going into spoilers, there are moments where something weird is thrown in and while at times it is funny, every now and then it feels like the directors trying are trying to make me point at the screen and laugh at how wacky and original they are. It doesn't necessarily take away from the film but I think it does hold it back from being a perfect 10 for me.

I loved every performance, stand outs being Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis for me but Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu were good too. I was surprised at how technically inept everything was, the action all flowed really well and the special effects looked, especially impressive when you see that all VFX were done by the directors and a few friends.

This is a feel good film with some big laughs but not quite a 10/10 for me.",9
12 March 2023,Beautifully shot and good overall message but it falls flat,"I did enjoy the movie kind of like how anyone enjoys a 6/10 movie. It started interesting but I left feeling dissatisfied and like they took it way too far. Without all the over the top actions scenes and sometimes cringeworthy comedy I think I would have loved it.

It feels like the movie doesn't take itself seriously. Therefore the viewer also has a hard time taking it seriously. This makes the message and the characters struggles feel trivial. Which really falls flat when it tries to bring fourth such a strong message. I understand it's supposed to be a movie about the meaning of life etc. Which was kind of interesting, at least how the mc resolves it. But as I said I really can't take it seriously.

Another thins is that the fight scenes are just way too long. I already know what's going to happen and dragging it out to 30 min makes me fall asleep.

To repeat what I wrote in the intro. If this movie just skipped out on the over the top ""all the time"" comedy and fight scenes, this would have been a really cool movie. Same messaging, same tropes but just a bit more serious and not so frivolous. And maybe left a bit more to interpretation.

If you like flashy fight scenes, slapstick comedy and you don't like when things become too real in movies. This is for you.",6
18 March 2023,The title says it all,"This movie is truly amazing and covers so much. It is nevertheless not easy to grasp at first sight.

What starts as a video game, is in fact a deep reflexion on family relationship between mother and daughter or father and daughter, inter generation differences, married life, polarisation between people, so very true in the US. It covers the ability of every individual to make choices and become any body. The multiverse is not the one created by Facebook, but the one created by yourself where every choice you make creates 2 life's running in parallel. The additions of choices made by every individual over time then create a web of universes where all possible situations are real... And in the end, the movie leads you to the conclusion that every life is worth it whatever your choices, everyone is different and deserves respect, love and dignity. Other life's are not necessarily better, so stick to yours and enrich it with love and tolerance to others.

It is pretty deep and so surprising and unexpected in a Hollywood world used to superficiality, fashion, and short-termism... It is also incredibly creative, fun, and energetic. The actors are great, and you spend a very good time. I went with 3 other people, and 24h later, we continue to speak only about this movie and try to isolate all the ideas, thoughts, messages, references embedded in the scenario.

Congratulations to the author's, directors, actors,... You made my day!",9
19 February 2023,Confused?,"We'll it is obviously a well made film but I didn't get it, I really have no idea what is going on. I'm currently halfway through but going to give up. It's hard to write a review because I really have no idea what I am reviewing. It started off half in English and half subtitled, within the same sentence, and from that point I was struggling. I guess it is about life but certainly not my life. I have read other reviews that people have recognised this film as the way their brains work, well I'm glad that I don't live in their heads, far to manic for me. I would recommend that you watch this and see what it means to you.

Butt plugs!"" etc. Elementary level humour. I was so ready to walk out of this garbage for first time of my life.

19 May 2022,"All kinds of mad, epic, delightful, and gorgeous! [+87%]","Writer-director duo Dan Kwan & Daniel Scheinert take the simplest of premises (a woman doing her taxes) featuring the simplest of conflicts (the uneasy mom-daughter scenario) and spins a fascinatingly wacky tale out of it. Visually and audibly epic, the film is a near-perfect blend of sci-fi, action, comedy, drama, and fantasy, with the cast and crew entirely aboard the ship of idiosyncrasies. It's the multiverse of madness like you've never imagined, taking you through different circumstances featuring the same characters but managing to stay coherent and engaging. There's no doubt that the film offers a lot to take in a single watch, but this is one of those works that warrant multiple viewings. Michelle Yeoh is genuinely on fire here (be it in handling the drama or the action set-pieces), and so is the entire supporting cast featuring actors from various ethnicities.

Yes, alternative realities have been explored in other films but not like this.

17 June 2022,Multi-gender. For teenagers only.,"The film is multi-genre and that is a problem on its own. The story and conflicts are meant to amuse teenagers. The first part of the movie can be a little confusing, so you'll want to see it twice, so you shouldn't want to see this movie at the cinema, wait to watch it at home. Currently this film is overrated in the IMDB ranking, the truth is that it doesn't come close to the great masterpieces of cinema. That being said, the movie is ok to have a little fun and a few laughs.

20 May 2022,A magnificent work of art,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is as the title suggest, a buffet of Thought. A glimpse into the very being of humanity.

It captures the absurdism of Camus, the nihilism of Nietzsche, the existential angst from Kierkegaard to Dostoevsky. It contains the deepest of metaphysical science, with bleeding edge theories of quantum physics.

It has love. Conflict. Right and wrong. It taught me things I did not know, and it taught me things I did not know I did not know.

I laughed until it hurt. I cried tears of joy and sadness. But most of all, I thought. At times I felt I understood what this universe is. I got a glimpse of real meaning.

This movie should truly be designated as a Wonder of the World. My future children will learn more in 2 hours and 19 minutes than Master's students in philosophy. They will appreciate and digest more art than 200,000 years of humanity combined. They will see an eternal work of art, that will be treasured for centuries to come.

Everything Everywhere All at Once stands on the shoulders of giants such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Schindler's List, and Fight Club. And it manages to overshadow them all. The magnitude of this feat can hardly be understood.

I am grateful to live in time and place to experience this work. It might just have been a statistical inevitability, but it's one I will treasure most of all.",6
31 August 2022,Where Soda Meets Sentiment; What?!,"Entering the twilight of her underwhelming life, an exhausted laundromat owner finds an outlet. I'm not sure how much more of the plot I can give away, because the shock absurdity of it all is a big part of what makes Everything Everywhere All at Once tick. Suffice to say, it's every bit as oddly, magically confounding as the directors' previous film, Swiss Army Man, which featured a fart-propelled corpse skimming waves and dispensing profound life lessons.

Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, collectively known as ""The Daniels,"" have carved themselves a distinct niche with these two films, alike in their polished visual excellence and strangely potent sense of sentimentality. After the sheer, gargantuan silliness of these concepts has essentially disarmed you, they posit, you're ripe for a deeper, more resonant message or two. In this case, the despondent store owner (Michelle Yeoh, who's fabulous) addresses the strain of a parent-child relationship from both perspectives and comes to terms with her own abundant, unrealistic aspirations and expectations. It's deep, powerful, universal stuff, which just so happens to be spread across a series of increasingly wacky, music-video kung-fu action scenes and random, contorted pop culture references.

Put simply, this movie is a trip. The first act is demanding, a dizzying rush of big exposition and long elaboration that whirls between English and several subtitled Chinese dialects, but that lengthy setup is essential to unlock the delightful insanity of the next hour. Once the real ride is underway, it's an uncontrollable snowball of fanny packs and razor blades. Riotously entertaining; you've gotta see this.",8
7 May 2022,Matrix but comedy,"Overall very interesting, well made movie. It has some minor problems like being just a little bit too long but they're not enough to ruin it. Great acting, interesting concept, ordinary, but not bad story. Definitely worth seeing.

18 May 2022,Confused,"I honestly didn't get it. It felt like an Asian acid trip. I had trouble following the plot and found most of the skits not adult funny, so I gave up halfway through the film. I did feel bad for the actor that played an IRS security agent that got beaten up by a girl swinging two giant anatomically correct white dildos. His off-set friends at his local pub are not going to let him live that scene down. You got beaten down to the floor with what?

15 April 2022,"A movie that tries to be everything, everywhere, all at once - and succeeds","Instantly in my top 10 movies of all time. It's rare a movie manages to be as absurd as it is heartfelt and as whimsical as it is thoughtful. Some things you see coming from a mile away - and still love them when they happen - and some things just hit you like a ton of bricks. This movie *will* require repeat viewing, but it's just so incredibly fresh that it feels like you want to watch it again as soon as it's over.

14 January 2023,Best movie of 2022,"There's little to say when a movie so absurd manages to not break the fourth wall. So. Here's some bullet points: 1. The editing is crazy good, and so is the vfx(the latter having been made by only self taught people is just crazy to me) 2. The writing is very good. After someone said something and there was some silence, i thought ""how would I write the rest of this conversation"" and found it incredibly hard, but when the conversation actually went on, I was always surprised 3. This movie has let me give a definition of surrealism/absurdism: ""saying real things with surreal events"", and I think this movie is brilliant in this aspect: it tackles emotions (and philosophy, and love) without being sugary.

9 July 2023,Silly Matrix parody trip,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

12 March 2023,It's alright,"It's pretty good but to be honest I thought it was kind of dumb. See for yourself. Daniels are creative directors and the cast was good but the movie itself was just sort of a bit too pithy or something like that in my opinion.

Cool to see short round in another movie
The while metaverse thing is so overdone now
Cool effects and some fun scenes
Also it's pretty long for what it is. Kind of repeats itself over and over again.

Well made and well acted.

Not a ""best picture"" but those have been pretty screwed up in recent years so I wouldn't be surprised if it wins although that seems unfair to some of these other movies from this year by comparison.

15 March 2023,I Was Really Hoping To Like It. But ... !,"EEAAO is likely to be the most overhyped movie I've encountered in a lifetime of watching movies. That this overlong, over imaginative, over indulgent, pastiche of a film managed to inveigle the Academy of Motion Picture Science into awarding it 7, yes 7, of the major Oscars is just beyond my comprehension.

Everyone (pun intended) seems to want to do multi - verse/ multi - dimensional films these days. Fine! But at least attempt to make them coherent enough to tell a story. The various Star Trek franchises have been doing this generally successfully for many years. The Matrix quadrilogy began with some genuinely original ideas on the concept, then later overcooked them. Marvel hopped on the bandwagon and don't look like jumping off for quite awhile. But at least the aforementioned generally had some sort of reasonably clear narrative, with which to tag along.

EEAAO has none of these attributes. Its multiverses exist as a means to an end, which believe you me, at 139 minutes is a very long time coming and indeed seemed much longer to this disappointed punter. The whole film seems like one great cinematic contradiction. It does have frenetic pace, but no suspense. It's marketed as a comedy. Yet, I found it best, as amusing in parts. It's full of dialogue, which is constantly repetitive and lacks any form of wit or cleverness. There are plenty of martial arts scenes which look almost deliberately over - choreographed, unrealistic and illusory. It does have a predictably (surprisingly brief in the context of the whole film) happy ending. It's just that it's irritatingly baffling, how we all get to it.

I've been a huge Michelle Yeo fan for many, many years. But to think that her albeit, zany, quirky, performance here, was considered superior to that of Cate Blanchett, who delivers one of the GREAT cinematic performances in Tar. Well to say I'm flabbergasted, is very much an understatement. Similarly, whilst Jamie Lee Curtis is a much admired actress, all she really does here is wear drab clothes, various wigs, prosthetics and shout a lot. This is deserving of an Oscar? Go figure.

EEAAO is a mediocre fantasy film with little grounding in actual reality. (Don't even get me started on bagels.) Its greatest attributes as far as I can see are that it looks, production wise, to be a bigger budgeted movie than it really is and its quick fire editing serves to disguise, one can only assume, its numerous deficiencies from its host of fawning admirers.",3
18 March 2023,Not confusing and fun to watch.,"Lot's of people are saying that it's ""confusing"". Well to me these people don't know what good writing is, you're supposed to discover the story along the main character. If you can predict everything or understand everything in the first 10 min it's not good writing. This movie keeps the questions going for at least half the run time, you slowly start to pick up on details and in the final moment you're supposed to 100% understand how the power works and how she's able to do everything she does. I had lot's of fun watching this and i did have my doubts but everything from the choreography to the random humour moment to the absolutely stunning visuals, everything was great! Movie is long but i feel like it could've gone forever with many possibilities. And im glad they didn't leave some ambiguity in the end to tease a sequel because it truly doesn't need one. One of the better movies iv'e seen in the last years!

27 June 2022,Something for Everyone All at Once,"So many things to love here. Female leads. Original, and made full use of the cinematic medium -- hard to have had the same impact in a book or on stage. Most importantly, the core messages. It doesnt matter what versions of life have passed us. It doesnt matter whether some may have left us wealthier or more successful. What matters is what we want in any given moment. What matters is what makes us happy in any given moment. What matters is family. And an extension of this is that familial relationships can be conplex and the key is acceptance. Acceptance of oneself and the other. With these basic ingredients, nothing else matters.

Whats also wonderful about the movie is that its not about what you think at the outset -- the story unfolds and unravels and emerges in a wonderfully engaging way. Highly recommend.

12 March 2023,This is an odd film for sure,"There are 3 parts to this film- the first part is the longest and I am unsure how many times I said out loud, ""WTF"", and wished the film were over. However, in the 2nd part the chaos of the 1st part come together and it builds to a crescendo with a very heartfelt, deep and meaningful message about life. I did not enjoy the humor personally and felt it was elementary. I understand both sides on the reviews, but for this one I'm in the middle. There are parts that will make you think, other parts will make you shake your head wondering what the heck just happened. I definitely didn't feel that it was one of the top movies I've seen, but I did enjoy the 2nd part, the 3rd part was compromised of less than 10 minutes.

I was so totally bored and found nothing that really appealed to me or entertained me and even the scene on the elevator where she entered some strange dimension it wasn't entertaining to me. I have no clue as to why this movie got so many Oscar wins and nominations because to me it was just nonsense and an utter waste of time. Simply put a bad movie. This just goes to show that so many movies the academy chooses for their prestigious awards, actually most people really don't find entertaining. They're strictly artsy fartsy movies which the majority of viewers aren't into and the Academy has never wavered from that formula.

9 July 2022,Loved It,"""I laughed, I cried"" is a cliche but this movie actually did it. I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in a long time. You can tell in the first 60 seconds how much love has gone into this movie. Every frame, camera movement, speck of light, facial expression has been agonized over. This isn't one of those movies where they just shoot generic coverage and throw it together in an editing bay. This movie understands the human soul. I've seen complaints that the humour is too ""lol so random"" at times. These people don't get it. This is a movie about the absurdity and infinity of reality. The strangeness is necessary and re-enforces the themes of the film. The Raccacoonie gag is about how we create our own world, sometimes by accident. It feels like a modern myth, a story that tells everyone something about themselves. Well done.

Those who enjoy American absurdist comedy-drama films should absolutely see it! A movie about a Chinese immigrant finds herself involved in a crazy adventure. You should watch this movie and then get your friends to do the same. We need more movies like this.

23 May 2023,What a disappointment,"I really had high expectations, for that reason I keep almost all the movie for the revolution moment where everything makes sense, waiting for something deep and a reflective message, but... when the intention of the movie finally appears it was just a disappointment.

I have to add that I consider someone who caught the idea and intention of the movie so fast, but in here it took to much, and that was exciting me because I though something big was coming, but as I said, just a normal message was expressed.

I don't want to disparage the idea and intention, it made me think and reflect, but I personally though they didn't find the way to go deep and achieve a personal effect, maybe because of the confusion of the ideas and because the gave so many time to their lives and their fight.

Anyway, it wasn't bad, I'll suggest it to my friends, but for me it was a disappointment.",6

Watch that movie even if you're ""not into these kinds of movies"" I think it might be good for you, or those near.

24 May 2022,This is the life,"I sit here minutes after finishing the movie, as the end credit song plays, wondering not of the countless versions of me that exist out there but of the decisions that brought me here. Everything Everywhere All at Once almost does not feel real in the sense of the traditional movie experience. As thousands of reviews have stated, it felt like an acid trip of a movie, one that bombards you with beautiful scenes, thrilling action, and genuine heartfelt sentiment that has but vanished from movies that reach a broad audience. While the film takes you through a whirlwind of universes and concepts, the heart of the story lies in its simplest and quietest moments, of a family understanding one another, of love and affection that transcends worlds, shown with an almost overwhelming amount of style, yet those concepts never leave the screen. With outstanding performances from all the cast, with Ke Huy Quan especially. As the song states, This is Our Life.

12 March 2023,"Surprising, funny but too long and disapointing","I sort of liked this film, it kept surprising me and making me feel rewarded for paying attention. It felt deep at times but then let itself down numerous times by either being cringy, repetitive, or just silly and boring. When things are moving at pace and the plot feels like its evolving this is a fantastic film, however the film as a whole does not deliver on some of the great promise the many magical and unusual moments prosise us. Altogether it ran for at least 30 minutes too long. Like with forest gump it feels like the creators realise they have something marvelous and cant let go of so much they actually need to let go of us to us a rather decent fim not the amazing epic they think they have.

19 March 2023,too long and stupid,"After several recent reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks this movie is pointless and don't understand how it could win any awards. First acting, I saw nothing outstanding about any of the acting, especially Jamie Lee Curtis. How could this movie win a bunch of acting awards? I'm going to say it's the wokeness of Hollywood willing to give awards to any film that has lead actors that are anything other than white.

The plot is too much, too much of everything that is makes no sense and leaves way too many plot holes. And at over 2 hours, it's like the same thing over and over, this has to be one of the worst editing jobs of the year.

FINAL VERDICT: Horrible plot, too silly, and makes you understand why awards shows have lost millions of viewers over the past several years because they choose films to win that don't deserve it. Please do not watch this.

There's incredible action sequences where some really creative fights occur. There are some really funny moments, really sad moments, and overall, it is a well-thought-out and well written thriller/mystery. It explores some scientific concepts in a really nice way, and at the same time, takes the viewer through an emotional experience.

14 March 2023,excellent a staple in movie history,"""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" is a mind-bending and visually stunning masterpiece that defies genre categorization. Directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, the film follows the journey of a Chinese-American woman named Evelyn wang (played brilliantly by Michelle Yeoh) as she discovers that she is connected to multiple parallel universes.

The film is a thrilling blend of science fiction, action, comedy, and drama, with each element seamlessly woven into the narrative. The action scenes are breathtaking, and the visual effects are nothing short of extraordinary especially when you consider the visual effects was made by three friends from YouTube tutorials. The filmmakers also inject a healthy dose of humor, providing much-needed levity amidst the mind-bending plot.

One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to tackle complex themes such as identity, self-discovery, and the nature of reality, without losing sight of its entertaining and accessible storytelling. The script is cleverly written and keeps the audience engaged from start to finish, with several unexpected plot twists and turns.

In addition to Michelle Yeoh, the cast is superb, with standout performances from Stephanie Hsu, Jamie lee Curtis and Ke Huy Quan. The film also features a diverse and inclusive representation of characters, which is refreshing to see in a mainstream blockbuster.

Overall, ""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" is a tour de force of filmmaking and a must-see for fans of science fiction, action, and comedy. Its blend of dazzling visuals, inventive storytelling, and memorable characters make it a standout in movie history, and a testament to the limitless possibilities of cinema.",10

It can be a bit heavy, and at first I didn't understand anything, mainly because I saw it in English with subtitles and the Chinese accent along with the times they mixed English with Chinese confused me.

BUT From half way trough movie it changed from si fi amazing movie with high expectations, going to some real life simulation with tons of SGI and si fi hopes, and lame fight scenes.... I Think that half of a movie is 10 and second half is 4 and that give rating 7.

I do recommend this movie, but you be ready for a little disapoitment, because in my case, people who recommended this movie to me, said it is great movie, I saw rating and short discription, and had so much ecpectations that after watching movie I had feeling like I wish someone didnt kidnap movie director and producer half way trough and replaced them to ruin second half of the movie.

20 September 2022,Craziest movie I have seen in years,"This was the craziest film I have seen in a long while. What a complete trip. Michelle Yeoh is utterly brilliant in this. After all of these years of her being around, it's nice to see her get her time in the sun.

The movie is bonkers though and I don't think everybody will enjoy it, it's relentless in its quirkiness and I think you definitely need to be in the mood for this kind of film else it will most likely fall flat for you. I recommended it to my family (mom and dad and my sister and her husband) and they all stopped watching it halfway ""calling it the biggest load of rubbish"".

There is a scene mid-way that made me tear up with laughter. I laughed so hard I though I was going to have a heart attack. I can't remember laughing that hard in a movie in donkey's ages (it involves phallic looking objects )

If you are looking for something really creative and fresh I would definitely recommend this one. As I mentioned its a trip. It felt like I had taken some hits from the good stuff.",8
13 June 2022,"Fun movie, despite nonsense","This is not a real story so it's fun. I got a little emotional by the end but I didn't sniffle. Kind of repetitive and stodgy but there's good enough stuff to keep you watching. The accents became distracting on rewatch but it's not a dealbreaker. The breakneck editing kind of is though. Anyways, very unique. Good choreography.

15 March 2023,The worst movie in a long time ....,"... I litterally stopped after 1 hour. That this movie could get 7 oscars is in my opinion not a matter of the quality of the movie, but ""it was time"" to recognize asien actors this year?

The movie just sucks - so simpel can I say it. It is like an old slapstick movie with weird effects an at some time, I thought, I was landed in Tarantinos screwed up mind.

The movie is banal, bland, messy and without meaning, the diaglogs are so bad. I couldn't even laugh, even if I saw, it was supposed to be a comedy and action.

Jamie Lee Curtis is the only highlight, she is phantastic - but then it gets weird again.

I havent seen such a bad movie (or tried to see he whole movie) since some cheap shark-attack movie back in the 90th.

4 June 2022,"Bonkers, brilliant, moving","There are a lot of multiverse movies recently. Many are full of inventive visual ideas and special effects. Most cost a fortune to make.

This one was cheap. But it beats the Marvel multiverse movies that cost 10 times more. And the reason is simple: the script is better. The characters have emotional arcs that mean something. You really don't know how the tension will resolve until the end. And the end is moving and profound. There is real feeling here and believable, imperfect characters.

The multiverse isn't just there for inventive, fun visual effects. It is there to allow us to explore character, motivation and, remarkably, deep philosophical choices. Somehow the characters explore deep issues of free will, choice, alternative paths for their lives and whether all those infinite choices mean absolutely nothing is meaningful. For a moment, the lead characters flirt with a nihilist resolution. But choose something different. Not a trivial resolution where good things happen and everyone lives happily ever after, but a realistic acceptance of the good things in a flawed, imperfect world.

The first time I watched it I thought it was a great movie. The second time I realised it was also a deeply moving story. The third time, I realised I had still missed a lot and it deserved an unequivocal top score.

It reminded me of some of my other favorite oddball movies. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich are good company for it.

Any move that just keeps getting better after multiple viewings has got to deserve a top score. And this is one of those movies.",10
6 January 2023,Don't miss . Excellent cinematography!!!,"I think it's probably one of the best films I have ever seen. Photography great , direction excellent . The actors are also really something else but the epic thing is the storyline . I thought I was high on drugs while I was watching the film . Honestly I cannot explain nor understand the level of masterminds that created this movie . It's so creative , so random , so amazing and yet so extremely simple and human . Everything in life is choices . Honestly I've never said that again but it's probably the best film I've ever seen because it amazed me at many levels . It's so original , new and extremely unique . I highly recommend watching this, maybe even more than once .

14 May 2022,Astonishingly beautiful,"Probably my favourite movie of all time. It's the only movie to have ever had the power to tame my bladder for over 2 hours. I could not disengage. This movie has EVERYTHING.

And the message behind it is astounding and makes sense in every way in my opinion.

21 May 2022,A profound madness of multiverse,"How come things that are so chaotic can translate into something beautiful and profound? I guess the Daniels know its perfect recipe and then bake that madness of the multiverse immaculately. Everything Everywhere All at Once is not only a love letter to Michelle Yeoh, but also to love itself. Hilariously silly, yet genuinely touching.

16 May 2022,Felt like an acid trip,"When people ask me the best song, or movie, I usually dodge the question. On what basis could I possibly answer this? There are a million different ways to rank media, so every piece of art is interesting or flawed in their own way. Also, art is subjective. I can safely say however, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is OBJECTIVELY the GREATEST movie of all time... by FAR. This movie is incredibly ambitious, juggling 7 different themes that somehow weave together and coalesce perfectly by the end of the movie. I actually cannot believe they managed to pull off this dangerous feat of beauty. It's a visually stunning psychedelic trip incorporating weighty philosophical ideas like existentialism and nihilism in a playful and humorous way. You will feel a combination of 4 different emotions ""All at Once"". The line between the metaphorical and literal is blurred. It is simultaneously very basic and accessible, but also esoteric and dense. Its both lowbrow and highbrow.

""Everything Everywhere all at Once"" includes 6 different genres that are somehow done perfectly. Its a drama, comedy, matrix film, Jackie Chan film, and multiverse film all in one movie. I cant criticize this movie in any way. I'm actually disgusted by how good this movie is. The acting was perfect and the pacing was spot on. Its intense (like uncut gems) that is overwhelmingly stimulating (emotionally, visually, and mentally) in the best way possible.

The political/cultural parts of the movie are conveyed in an authentic and non-soy way. It includes an older immigrant woman, her gay daughter, and a message about acceptance and love yet there was no fake, overdone ""GIRLPOWER!! LOOK STRONG WOMAN"" cringe. ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a 10/10 film that excels above every film I have seen on all dimensions. Please watch this film. I sound like a crazy person right now, but I promise after watching the movie, you will understand my fanaticism and thank me for the recommendation.",
27 April 2022,A Rick and Morty episode expanded into a 130 minute Tik-tok video.,"This movie was probably conscientiously designed with the goal of teaching some valuable life lessons to the increasing portion of the population with 15 second attention span. Some scenes were clearly shot for the trailer and the movie throughtout fights HARD for your attention. There's no problem with this, the goal is noble. Several plot elements and the main message are very similar to an early Rick and Morty episode to the point that it probably inspired this movie. Of course there are plenty of original ideas as well, the movie was made with great care and effort.

4 June 2022,This review is here,"In other realities, this movie sucked. But...in this reality, this movie is rad as hell. It had Kung Fu, pi√±atas, hot dog hands, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Overall, forget Dr. Strange... this multiverse was maddeningly entertaining.

22 May 2022,I got bored one day and I put everything in a movie:,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",6
30 August 2022,The True Multiverse of Madness,"What a bonkers, insane, emotional and hilarious ride. This film proves that Disney may have all the money but that is nothing in the face of good writing. Disney's multiverse movie (Doctor Strange: ITMOM) had a budget $200 million yet is trounced in every aspect by Everything Everywhere which has a budget of $25 million. It's all in the writing.

The film seems to start off as a conventional family drama film, with a past-her-prime mother running a small business, who is struggling to make meets end, her husband who she becomes more distant from, the daughter discovering herself but moving away from her parents in the process and the grandfather whose views are dated. The film starts off like this, but then goes absolutely bonkers, delivering some insane action-sequences and dropping a ton of information on the audience. Yet it all makes sense. At no point are you lost in the madness. You're invested the whole way through with strong characters, excellent performances and excellent handling of themes such as nihilism, existentialism, regret, love and kindness.

The acting is top-notch across the board with particular praise going to Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn and Ke Huy Quan as Waymond. Their relationship is central to the movie and the actors give it their all and deliver some truly stunning, inventive and bonkers action sequences. The visuals are also fantastic, with excellent uses of colour, lighting and camera tricks to give the film its own unique style.

The biggest takeaways from this film are the lessons it teaches. You feel like a better human being for having watched it. Despite all the madness, the emotional moments still hit hard and by the end all the pieces fall into place, leaving you satisfied. This film doesn't need to lecture the audience on modern world problems, or explain that because of its diverse casting it is some cultural moment. No. All you need is good writing.

Overall, Everything Everywhere All At Once is best described as indescribable. It has to be seen to be fully appreciated. The characters are wonderful, the acting excellent, the visuals and action are wacky in all the best ways and the deeper emotional meaning of the film really shines through. If you have to watch one multiverse film this year, make it this one.",9
5 August 2022,Weird does not equal good,"It was DEFINITELY weird and not like your average movie or story - which I really did appreciate. But there comes a point where more and more weird does not make it good. I was really looking forward to this movie and it disappointed me. Don't believe the hype of the reviews.

23 March 2023,A waste of over 2 Hours!,"How the hell did this movie get put forward for the Oscar's ? None of the performances were anything special, as for getting loads of awards , what a joke, but nothing to laugh about! The story makes no sense whatsoever , they must have spent all the money on the affects ! Certainly not the script , Jamie Lee Curtis, part was not Worthy of the Oscar & Michelle Yeoh has been in better movies!

I nearly gave up after watching this movie for 30 minutes, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I watched it to the end, Nearly 2 hours 19 minutes which I will never get back again, far too long.

1 June 2022,I cried at the end (in a happy way),"Probably not for everyone but this movie reflects on life, and in particular relates to people with sore estranged relationships with their parents as they get older. The plot can be a bit all over the place but I think that's part of the movie's charm.

I think I would recommend it to those who are willing to experience a seriously life reflecting movie, that also doesn't take itself too seriously. You don't really know or have certainty on what is going to happen next. Except constantly expecting the most ludicrous scenarios like (a universe with people having hot dog fingers lmao), but it is an emotional theatrical masterpiece. Very well made special effects, lots of funny scenes and it's ultimately a movie about life and the choices we are too afraid to make.

Again probably not for everyone but I typically like action films and enjoyed the fight scenes. I really think this movie is underrated and an amazing job in making me feel deeply. Very few Hollywood movies are able to do that for me. And why it gets ten stars from me.",10
20 December 2022,"A beautiful journey of awareness, love, and gratitude","This movie is exactly the kind of thing modern day formulaic big box office films and rush produced streaming movies are missing nowadays. A certain special mix of whimsical, unserious, and hilarious absurdity that aims to poke fun at the banality (and eventuality) of taxes and laundry.

All while celebrating the joy that can (and should) be derived from every moment of being alive; because we are all tiny insignificant beings in an incomprehensibly large galaxy.

This movie uses cultural references and ridiculous humor unexpectedly to provoke the audience to seek self awareness and to live in the moment. Which is precisely the reason why many of the negative reviews I've read here speak more about the viewer than the movie. If you can't find humor, warmth, empathy or just appreciation for the originality of this brilliantly written story - then you need to stick to marvel movies.

In short, it's nothing shy of brilliant and for sure one of the best movies of 2022. Worth all the praise.",10
8 April 2023,Absolutely Everything,"I don't know what to say about this movie. It's bizonkers and I love it. So wonderfully wild, creative and deep. This is the kind of movie we're all asking for when we see the 100th Fast and Furious movie coming out doing the same old thing. Its original, its new, its fresh. It somehow makes hotdog fingers a potent metaphor for the diversity and inclusiveness of love. It makes a bagel ominous and sex toys dangerous while still being deeply moving in its meaning.

Lets just hope we're not inundated with clones that completely miss the point. Replicants that see the quirk but not the depth, the crazy but not the conversation.

7 June 2022,It was okay,"This movie is... okay. Not the best, most profound thing ever. Not the most confusing mess of a story. Just okay.

It takes a while to get started, but by the end of Act 1, it *really* gets started. The climax of Act 1 is over-the-top in all the right ways, and had me in tears laughing at certain points. I figured that, although the start is very slow, now that we were in THE action, the rest of the movie would be just as good as everyone was telling me it was.

And... it wasn't. This is a movie that really peaks at the climax of Act 1. Everything is absurdist, over-the-top, yet comprehensible, hilarious, and tense. All the pieces were there for a great film. But Act 2... drops the ball. Not hard, but like a gentle fluttering towards the ground, where you watch the ball descending and try to convince yourself that the ball is not, in fact, descending, but at some point you have to admit to yourself that it's far lower than it was before. It goes on an excruciating amount of time, it throws up the husband's idea of fighting as ""being nice to others"" despite the fact that every alternate husband we've seen so far is essentially a combat master. And apparently that's the key to unlocking the villain's heart, the villain having turned from an over-the-top, enjoyable, yet still sympathetic and mysterious force of nature, to a whiny, depressed teenage girl whose only echoes of the character she used to be are her outlandish outfits in each scene. It wasn't fighting for survival it was just... being nice? I guess?

The movie gets unusually predictable from here to the end. The only unpredictable things are the different universes, which remain the most enjoyable part of the movie. But by the time Act 2 gets going, you will absolutely know how it ends: just like any other movie out there. And so it does. They also force a happy ending for one plot thread that seemingly comes out of nowhere. Given a huge message of the film is ""nothing matters, but you might as well enjoy it"", I feel like it would have been much more powerful to go the direction that plot thread was clearly heading, only for the character affected to be assured that the lack of acceptance she received means nothing as long as she, herself, could be proud of who she is. In a world where being LGBT is still seen by many, especially in traditional culture, as wrong, it is unrealistic -- and unhealthy -- to hope that everyone accepts you as you are. You need to find your own happiness and acceptance, because not everyone will be willing to give it to you.

I won't mention Act 3, because it's not even really an act.

So yeah, okay film. By the time the second credits started rolling, I didn't even stay to see if it was another fake-out. I was honestly just done with the film. I can't really recommend it. Maybe just look up the action scenes as they are easily the best part of the film.",6
2 October 2022,One of the movie that so amazing that have a big heart in it.,"One of the best film that ever made, i love science fiction film, i love action film, i love romance film, i love family film, and these film combine all of that with grace and coolness, i never found a film like this, Everything Everywhere All at Once is very cool and heartwarming, i never cry so hard watching film except this film, i love how humanly message that daniels give and spread from this film, it's like they made a family movie with science fiction on it, the cast is perfectly complete each other, i never think michelle yeoh can be my favourite actress, and i love how jamie curtis bring her unique personality in this film. I know this film will be remembered in many many years after as a greatest family, scifi, fantasy, action, and mother film.

20 July 2022,mixed feelings over here,"It's an exaggerated film.

My favorite part of the film was the leading actress. Her acting is great and she's very funny but brings a much needed subtlety and sort of more calm, less dramatic vibe to this very dramatic chaotic movie.

My least favorite part, the visuals. Just personally doesn't do it for me, feels draining and like it's trying to sell more or be different and original but just doesn't get there. Just a matter of the style i guess, feels very like ""oh cool look at all these ideas and elements, let's use literally all of it"". If this movie were a food it'd be one of those hamburgers but the buns are glazed donuts, with onion rings, two types of sauce and rainbow sprinkles. Not everyone would eat and enjoy but it will catch everyone's attention.

I felt like the other things i loved kind of became what i didn't like after sometime. Like how it's unexpected and you can't tell what's coming, but then this element gets tired and overused. Or how it's psychological and reaches for the character's depth and complexity of their relationship to each other, but then again kind of goes too far and gets repetitive. I loved how it tackled heavier issues like suicide ideation, mental health but again, as it went on and on and just got too stretched to the point it drained my energy and it didn't feel worth it.

To finish off i loved the idea, it had a lot of potential, it has its great moments, but just doesn't get there. My biggest personal bias is that i hate romance, not as in a couple in love but as in how a message is delivered in a very positive light way but with a lot of struggle before it. ""nothing matters"" but ""i will always be here for you"" and that kinda stuff. It's just too romantic for me when things go from relatable and simple to something aiming to be beautiful and extraordinary. I think we should be kind of past that at this point as humans, as time progresses and we see how effed up things really are as a whole and instead of being proactive we try to escape to a better, more digestible place where we can be comfortable again.",

1 March 2023,Too much blinking effects,"I could not endure this movie to the very end. Just could not bear the blinking effects and the fast changing of scenes. I see some ressemlence of a good story line, but there are a lot of plot wholes and ambiguities. It starts very slow and then it gets so fast paced and I could barely catch up with the plot. I liked the fighting shots, the arrangement and filming of the scnes, the acting was at a good level, but there should really be a less acid trip way of telling that story. I really hope that whoever caused himself the suffering to endure that movie to the very end will find it was worth it.

8 April 2023,"The Oscars proves, yet again, that they live in alternate universe","There have been many occasions in the past where I've looked at movies the Oscars think are best picture (Birdman, Moonlight) and wondered what they were seeing that I wasn't. But not even close to the bewilderment I felt over this.

Apparently, there is some intergalactic conflict, and some hapless owner of a laundromat and her family are drawn into it. That sets the stage for an unrelenting, almost nauseating, set of colourful, hyperkinetic scenes that also manage to be rather boring.

I guess that buried deep in there is a message about accepting life and finding pleasure in the small things, and another message about accepting gay persons, which is fine, but it's been done better in so many movies. I guess the people who made this movie thought wrapping it inside some sci-fi adventure/acid trip would make more of an impact? I don't know.

In any case, this movie did not even come close to deserving the accolades it received. And it pains me to say this, but Jamie Lee Curtis getting an Oscar for this is absurd. Her part is tiny and took less talent than her role in the original Hallowe'en.

This movie proves my theory that you should wait several months for a movie to come out, read the most recent reviews, and you'll find the truth about a movie, not the early reviews whos objectivity is questionable.

This movie was a '2' but I am giving it a '3' for some of the visuals and a couple of interesting martial arts sequences.",3
13 September 2022,The best film of the year?,"Well, I was really looking forward to this film and probably it was even my most anticipated film from this year. Because the Daniels delivered a great film with Swiss Army Man, which quickly became one of my favorite films. Well, and together with A24 and the creative trailers, this can only go well. Nevertheless, I also have my problems with the film.

But be that as it may, one thing is certain, because Everything Everywhere All at Once is undoubtedly the most creative film of the year. If not the most creative film of all time. This becomes clear in the first shot alone, in which you can see the family through a mirror in the film. And even if this shot is quite short, you already learn so much about the family. Well, and that also extends over the entire film, this incredible creativity. For example, when the characters talk and in the background you can see something that is actually much more important, but the characters don't notice it. And there are so many scenes that are brimming with creativity. But of course, this creativity comes to the climax when it comes to the multiverse. I mean, there are so many ideas that are simply unique and that you have never seen before. For example, if the characters want to gain access to another universe and then have to do something specific for it. The scene with the paper somehow hurts more than any fight scene and the same applies to the scene with the dildo. I mean, who comes up with such ideas? And then there are so many other ideas that you could talk about it for an eternity. Everything that has to do with Ratatouille is just so funny or the scene with the stones, with the pinatas. All this is just so great, so unique, so unforgettable and thus without a doubt probably the most creative thing I have ever seen.

By the way, someone else noticed that the melody from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" appears. It may also sound similar, but I could swear it's the same melody.

Well, the fact that the film is so creative doesn't mean that the plot is good. In this case It does. Because Everything Everywhere All at Once is not a film about the multiverse, not an action film, not a typical hero's journey, it's a family film. About a family, for the family (even if some scenes are probably not suitable for everyone). I actually expected something different and rather a typical hero story in which Evelyn has to save the multiverse, but instead it's more about understanding what family really means, that you can overlook little manners, accept everyone as they are and should appreciate everyone who loves you. Well, there is so much more behind the creative facade. A damn multi-layered film that you won't soon forget.

Another great aspect of the film is also the characters and the actors who embody them. All the characters in the film are just fantastically written. This is because they all have their weaknesses and are not perfect. I hate these films in which the protagonist is just perfect in every way, masters everything immediately and has no weaknesses. But in this film, every character has any blemishes, weaknesses and bad qualities, as every real person has. Nevertheless, all characters are likeable. Evelyn, for example, is a great protagonist. On the one hand, she is quite a big asshole to her daughter because she is still stuck to old values, but we understand her more and more the better we get to know her. Well, and she is also sympathetic because she is a bit clumsy and dreamy. This also means that she cannot do everything immediately. When there are fight scenes, it takes time for her to master them and manage to enter other universes. At least on purpose. She is a multi-layered character with weaknesses, with strengths and a great character development. And the same applies to the rest of the characters.

But probably it's also due to the great actors who embody the fantastic characters. Michelle Yeoh is just great in the role and plays everything damn convincingly so that she could carry the film on her own shoulders. But fortunately she doesn't have to, because after all she also gets great support. Among others, of course, from Ke Huy Quan. Except for Indiana Jones and The Goonies, I didn't really know him, but he's probably the heart of the film. He is so naive and actually always in a good mood and always nice and he just plays a character you have to like. But Stepahnie Hsu is also great and always convincing in her role, even if I didn't really know her before. Well, and then of course there is Jamie Lee Curtis who can also be seen here in a completely different role than you are used to from her. Well, and what more can you say, except that she is also fantastic.

But as already mentioned, not everything is so perfect in my opinion. There is the first act, which I think takes too long. The characters are introduced, their relationships with each other and the film is built up, but the first act is clearly the weakest. Or then there are other little things. For example, I am bothered by the fact that in a multiverse full of different possibilities, the good and evil are mother and daughter. I know it's about family, but I still found it a bit too constructed. For example, I would have liked it better if the antagonist had been someone completely different or Evelyn herself.

Well, I'm just saying that the movie isn't perfect, but what's perfect? (Except Fight Club, of course) But even if something is not perfect, you can still love it and somehow that's probably the message of this film. Unconditional love.",9
15 March 2023,A modern masterpiece,"Simply put, this is one of the best films of the 21st century. In my opinion, certainly top 10.

Michelle Yeoh is a tour de force playing multiple roles opposite the fantastic Ke Huy Quan, both of whom excel in the multi-faceted nature of their characters as they explore a complex, comedic and heartbreaking multiverse.

Jamie Lee Curtis is a fantastic addition, however it is Stephanie Hsu's performance that stole the show for me. She, more than any other character, excelled in the madness of the multiverse and was eye catching in every scene.

It is easy to get caught up in the visual effects, eccentric costumes and excellent fight scenes but the true brilliance of this film lies in the humanity of it all. At its very soul it is a film about family, love, loss and finding yourself. It has a great central message of acceptance and it is going to be a film we talk about for years to come.",10
22 May 2022,One of the greatest films I've ever watched,"Wow, this film is truly magnificent. The meaningful messages it carries and the way they deliver them is brilliant. Even though the film runs for over 2 hours there isn't one moment where you as the viewer is bored or feels as though it is slogging along. 10/10, watched it once and I think it's already in my top 5 favourite films of all time.

18 May 2022,"An honestly ""okay"" movie","The movie has undeniably good ratings. Having an above average rating, I was curious as to how the plot would go and transpire. I'm not really a sci-fi genre fan, nonetheless, I decided to give it a try.

Now, I genuinely don't know what others saw or felt throughout the film to think it deserved such high appraisal. It wasn't bad, it was just mediocre at best. Although it could be a fun and motivating experience to watch with your family, since the whole film revolved around the ideologies and difficulties of each member of the Wang family. Perhaps you can relate to some struggles and actually really enjoy the film. The characters are truly likeable in ways that you can feel the conflict within them- they make you understand their emptiness, like how they can be hopeless and hopeful all at once.

It generally depends on how you interpret the value of the movie. Joy's anguish and desperation to feel something- to find meaning in her otherwise pointless endeavor to live, the pain of feeling alone with nobody to understand you- even the closest to your heart, can be quite relatable to most people.

You should watch it, you might enjoy it- or not.",7

13 August 2022,"refreshinly unique, emotionally unsatisfying","In some ways, the mother definitely deserved to win her daughter back after going through universes of troubles. But in others, she also didn't, because nothing happened in the ""real world"" that would lead them to resolve their misunderstandings. At the end of the movie, I thought, oh it might just all be in her own mind. That's why the ending felt unsatisfying to me. Refreshingly unique movie, regardless.

15 April 2022,The most perfect movie I've ever watched,"This is the only movie I have ever thought completely deserves a 10 star rating. I cannot find a single flaw in the film.

Be prepared to laugh so hard you'll have tears streaming down your face. Be prepared to be so awed by the incredible soundtrack that it feels like ever cell in your body is vibrating. Be prepared to have an almost spiritual experience in the final two parts.

This may not be the best action movie. It may not be the best comedy. It may not be the most profound film. But it is the most profound action comedy I have ever been blessed to witness. 2hrs 30mins of pure perfection.

Will be watching this again and again for a long time.

1 August 2022,A bit too much?,"I had pretty high hopes for this movie because my friend said every Asian kid that watched this movie cried. I didn't cry but thats not the thing. The thing is that I get the theme of the movie and the big idea, but some parts I was confused on and/or did not enjoy. For example, the rated R parts. I wouldn't say that this movie is bad it's just that I don't agree with the way the director wants to present the message of movie.

10 July 2022,I wanted it to end after 5 minutes,"This film is original, that's about it. Either they hired a lot of people to hype this movie or the end of the human race is upon us. The film has a complicated and disorganized narrative and about 86 action sequences too much! The subtitles were a mess, between the subtitles in the film and the close captioning I have on my tv... I was reading two different books while a loud and obnoxious movie plays behind me. Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen, period.

22 May 2022,Written by men,"Felt so sorry for the main character - why was she fully responsible for the laundry shop, the accounts, the taxes, the meals, the daughter's mental health? She didn't even have a say in buying the laundrette shop - she was told by the husband he had bought it already.

At one point I think her and women like her were called 'cold unloving bitches'.

Apart from this awful position she was in, the acting was good. The mother-daughter relationship development was good.

But overall left me slightly cold at the take on the assumed responsibilities of a woman and why she should be happy with her lot.

16 August 2022,Bagel,"One of the most creative and revolutionary movies in years. Usually I am not the biggest fan of surreal or experimental movies that completely go wild. But this one worked brilliantly. It was the mix of dark humor and the film not taking itself too seriously in some dimensions(....) but taking it seriously in the right ones. Its a fantastic screenplay and one that will be hard to beat this year for sure. Seriously I dont know on what substances the writers were but it was the right mixture.

The acting was outstanding as well. Michelle Yeoh has never been better and for a veteran actress like her that says a lot. I really hope she gets her dues this year. A great discovery was Stephanie Hse, who surely will go her way after this film. A great supporting performance that is memorable on many different levels. It was great to see Ke Huy Quan return with to the movie world with a bang like this. Many remember him as Short Round or Data in some very famous 80s classics. He turns into a very versetaile and demanding performance as well and manages those challenges fantastically. Last but not least there is Jamie Lee Curtis who obvioulsy had a lot of fun playing her role and puts a lot of energy into it. She was great, as she played against character. Sometimes a bit too cartoonish, but then again... thats the character.

The cinematography, the score and especially the editing were top notch and make this a visual masterpiece. It works on so many layers and the re-watch factor is very high as well. I did not expect that I will love this movie is much as I did. Glad there is still braverty in the movie work to produce a wild ride of creativity like this.",10
13 December 2022,"If part 1 wears you out, watch this in two parts","I have a suggestion for anyone thinking of watching this film. The film has a part 1 & 2 (and a part 3, but it's not relevant here). It can feel confusing and overwhelming to absorb everything happening, everywhere, all of the time. If you reach the end of part 1 (you'll know when that is), and you feel at that point that it's all just too (insert anything here), then pause it for another time. This is what I did, and I was glad. I returned later to watch part 2, and I can say that I was glad I did. But I don't know if I could have enjoyed part 2 if had not waited for another day. The ending pays off (unless you're a hardened cynic). A score of 7 from me is a good score. It's overhyped, but I still recommend it.

27 February 2023,"Everything everywhere all at once, never more","I haven't watched a movie as bad as the one I just watched in a long time, called Everything everywhere all at once (2023)). The film has good actors who, unfortunately, due to the poorly told story, cut out, repeated, confused, etc..., do not contribute much to improve the film. Supposedly this movie is advertised as a comedy - there is absolutely nothing comic in it. The few attempts make already silly situations even sillier (e.g., the one where in a given universe people have sausages for fingers). There is no continuity in the 2 hours and 19 minutes of film - you can leave the room for lunch, for example, leave the film playing and, when you return, continue watching it; the unseen part (whatever it may be) will have very little importance in the 'understanding' of the film because parts are repeated with slight variations. Also, I think that about 2/3 of the film focuses on very well-choreographed kung-fu style fights that a lot of people like and that, perhaps, is one of the reasons it was nominated for an Oscar. I cannot see any other reason for the indication.

All I know it was something about the multiverse and it looks like a B+ blockbuster film to me. I'm was so shock to see that this movie was more than that. As funny and weird this movie was, it had some heartfelt emotional moments in it with a believable message. At the end, my mind was all over the place (no pun intended) and as I'm typing this, I can't wrap around what movie I just watched and how incredible it is. I'm glad I got around the experience and it is up there as one of the best movies of all time...well, for me of course. That's all I have to say.

28 June 2022,Superb,"A must watch. There is really nothing bad that can be said about this movie. Every scene is so deep and can be interpreted in numerous different ways for pretty much anyone to relate to and apply to their own life. It honestly has everything. Humor, heart, wisdom, amazing cinematography and score. The whole movie is rife with symbolism and philosophical concepts - yin/yang being the obvious ones. The existential nihilist concepts explored are unlike anything I've seen in any medium - some feel right out of the page of Schopenhauer. It's a superb film for all, but especially for those who lean toward pessimistic, misanthropic, and nihilistic worldviews, as it's a much needed reminder that there is always another way to look at things. It doesn't always have to be about the negative.

It's like Monty Python and a grown-up Alice In Wonderland had a baby, this movie. The genius is in how the creators comically weave the nonsensical, shattered pieces of a life into a beautiful mosaic. It's in how meaning takes shape stepping back to gape in wonder at the way chaos connects, or the way you choose to believe it connects. It's as much a poem as a movie.

5 November 2022,A beautiful thing I discovered,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",10
28 May 2023,Quirky at its best!,"The movie begins by introducing a relatable protagonist dealing with everyday challenges. However, within the first 20 minutes, the plot takes an unexpected turn into the realm of parallel universes. While this concept has been extensively explored by Marvel and DC, it may not offer anything groundbreaking for audiences familiar with those franchises.

For viewers who are not well-versed in the concept of parallel universes, the movie might leave them feeling a bit bewildered as they try to comprehend what is happening on the screen. As the plot progresses, numerous elements are introduced, making it challenging for those who are not avid readers of comics or followers of recent science fiction films to keep track of everything.

Despite these complexities, the film remains an enjoyable experience for veterans of the genre and can be appreciated at least once. However, it's unclear how it won an Oscar, as there may have been other films with stronger merits.

I would still recommend 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' to individuals who already have a good understanding of parallel universes and are interested in scientific concepts intertwined with the narrative.",7

12 August 2023,Another multiverse mess,"So far Spiderman has done it best but none, including Spidey, are really doing justice to the multiverse concept.

This film went off the deep end early on and the producers let the unhinged director make art. If I want to look at art, I'll go to a museum. I generally watch movies to be entertained. This failed me as a form of entertainment. What it did succeed in doing is irritating me, making me feel like I submitted to someone else's arty LSD trip that made absolutely no sense.

Did it deserve all the Oscar's it won? I honestly don't care. The Oscar's haven't made sense to me in years. The Academy has its own ideas about what it wants to laud. Let them do it. You do you. I'll do me, maybe in several different dimensions., everywhere, all at once.

The cinematography, set design, and costuming are all so meticulous handled; you can feel the amount of love and attention every aspect was given. The different gags throughout upped the ante every time and rarely missed. The pain was so deep, personal, and specific and yet also so broadly human that it would be impossible not to be moved. I love this movie. I wish more movies were like this movie. Do yourself a favor and go see it.

22 May 2022,"Trippy, entertaining and healing.","It turned out to be one of the most trippy movies that I've watched in recent times. Interesting that it came out of A24, that's usually known for indie-movies.

The trailer made it seem like it's a sci-fi ""Shang Chi meets Dr. Strange & Wanda"" kinda movie but nooo, faaar from it.

I'll admit that I had to do some reading/research after to movie to make complete sense of the the plot, people's interpretation and hidden meanings, but without all that, you can say that it's a movie a...family portrait (?) told in the context of a sci-fi multiverse in the form of an action-comedy-drama about self-reflection & healing.

That kept aside, the acting by everyone was really good. Michelle Yeoh finally gets a chance to do something in addition to just action and she delivered; comedy, drama, sadness, everything! So does Ke Huy Quan, but the standout IMO was Stephanie Hsu, the daughter. *slow claps*The cinematography, editing and sound design deserve special mentions.

I still have more reading to do about this lol but if you want to watch something totally out there and yet entertaining & moving, don't miss this one. Watch it in the theater to experience the trippy journey that this movie will take you on.",8

30 October 2022,What's all the hype about?,"Did this movie deserve to be the phenomenon that it became? I would say it did, because of how much the filmmakers clearly put into it. You won't get any good reasons as to why this movie is special in the first few scenes, and even when things begin to unfold, it's still not entirely clear why so many have responded so strongly to it. Over the course of the runtime, however, you are bombarded with an endless series of unusual, unique moments that just keep coming, right through to the end. Just when you think this movie has gotten so off-the-wall that they can't possibly throw anything else that unexpected at you, they do. The main drawback is that during the final third of the movie, we get too many drawn-out, overly sentimental moments of reflection that really needed to be trimmed down to be effective. It gets a bit repetitive, to the point that I am hesitant to re-watch the film, even though there is so much to like. I still have to praise it, however--there haven't been very many movies that have gotten as bat-s%#$ crazy as EEAAO.

27 August 2022,Representing Asians,"Going through all the reviews, I have to wonder how many people are white, who didn't like it. I say this because all my Asian friends rate this film 10/10 because for the first time in a very relatively western based film, we felt represented. The movie, as crazy as it was, didn't feel like it was meant for a white audience and therefore many people came away not understanding the real point of the film because they themselves have never experienced it in real life.

At the core of the film, the suffering of the daughter and the way she's treated by her mother was reflected so clearly in my own life. This film felt like it was made for me, to reflect my experiences as an Asian woman growing up and not a white woman. I've never seen that before. This film is brilliant and a must watch, but it also made me tear up because for the first time of elf seen. So I would ignore the people going in not truly understanding the point of the film - that it was never for their white experiences, but rather that it was aimed at those of us who rarely see our own life reflected in Hollywood-esque cinema.

16 March 2023,Plot is Disorganized & Too Much BDSM/Kink,"I think the acting was phenomenal, and that the general storyline held a lot of promise and significance. I believe they chose a heroine and a storyline in general which provided a lot of social commentary about modern American life, and the overwhelming nature of our capitalist culture and how it punishes minorities the most.

Unfortunately, the film seems to lack an articulated or properly-maintained plot at points, and tries to juggle way too many different themes and directions at the same time to be comprehensible. I was very frustrated by how often the plot took off ramps onto another theme or action scene, without fully developing and explaining what was going on (descriptively or symbolically) in the previous scenes. I'm guessing this may have something to do with the average American's ever decreasing attention span and critical thinking skills, which seems to have negatively influenced Hollywood film directing over the years. Regardless of the real reason behind these directing decisions, it made it very difficult to absorb the material at times.

I was also disappointed with the character development of Jobu Tupaki/Joy. I never felt the audience got sufficient explanation or context behind /why/ she was so suicidal and hostile toward her mother, beyond some superficial information detailing typical parent/ teen child antagonism, or the story of split personalities due to too much multiverse switching. Someone who is going through complex suffering and struggles to develop into that character deserves a comprehensive backstory and contextual interpretation. Perhaps some of the explanations for her pain lie in inter-generational conflicts within Chinese American families, in which case that explanation may have been lost in cultural translation. But I also think aspects of her backstory and character may have also just been poorly written.

Also, there are far too many kink and BDSM material to make me feel comfortable. Perhaps, in another universe, these BDSM scenes are poorly-developed attempts at satire, and poking fun at sex-crazed American society. But I'm pretty sure the film was directly promoting a culture that for many people is often one of out-of-control consumerism, exploitation, and abuse. I get it, adding this material gives the illusion of adding prestige, exoticism, or 'intricacy' to a film. That's often the effect BDSM references have on general audiences, since that culture is taken at face value as a 'rebellion against normalcy'. Introducing BDSM themes out of context also has some kind of shock and awe effect, and can be injected in content that may not otherwise be sufficiently thought provoking. But that's just it, the real value of this material is illusive, and putting motifs of kinky practices in film to substitute more powerful messages or ideas can't fool everyone. That's not including how gross and disturbing a lot of the kink content was to begin with.",6
19 March 2023,About as Subtle as Punch & Judy,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

16 March 2023,Deserved,"Everything Everywhere All At Once , movie that bagged 7 Oscars out of 11 nominations . Actually tried to watch it on big screen but didn't got released in my region and then waited for official digital release in India , atlast got released on Sony Liv platform and finally watched it right before the night of Oscar event . Movie totally surprised me with almost everything , title actually suits for the quality of the movie too , Direction , Screenplay , Editing , Camera Work , Action set pieces , Casts Performance , etc , etc where just topnotch . Core concept of the movie is quite simple , an emotional family drama well narrated with multiversal concept . It's really inspiring and intriguing that Daniels pulled off this magic with such a low budget and small crew , as an aspiring filmmaker I'm really eager to study their process and behind the scenes of EEAAO . After Oscars there was sudden urge of hate towards EEAAO just because it won 7 awards , I truly believe it deserved each and every award it bagged . People who haven't watched , kindly watch it , I hope you like it and if you're aspiring filmmaker then definitely don't miss out .

( In a World where they assume only big budget movies can only deliver extravaganza visuals and actions , there came EEAAO a big indie film which was produced under budget of 15 million dollars with only crew of 9 people and shot within 38 days , still delivered a great visuals with intresting content comparing to so called high budget movies and not only bagged 7 oscars but also became most awarded film of all time . )",10
20 August 2022,"Taking in the ""Everything"" and Understanding the ""Everything""","Some of the most important ingredients needed to make a film possible are passion, determination and craft- but most importantly it takes an immeasurable amount of CREATIVITY! If it's one thing I've learned with seeing films from both A24 and The Daniels, creativity is a quality neither are short of when it comes to displaying it out to the world. With all that being said the latest venture from The Daniels, Everything Everywhere All at Once, is one of the most extraordinary and pleasantly psychotic pieces of entertainment I've ever seen on the silver screen!!! This film fires on all cylinders when it comes to displaying the abundant amount of originality and creativity behind its premise, which I something you don't see very often in movies today. It's a real rarity when finding films of this nature that not only succeeds in whacky & absurd entertainment (being action or what not), but also finding the time to deliver a meaningful & and complex story that you're unlikely to forget anytime soon.

Based on my observations from previous Daniels' productions, I came to expect the usual quirks and weirdness with their brand of humor but never did I expect for it to effectively blossom as it did on such a large scale. Tagging alongside the humor, there is a great amount of heart and feeling to further increase your emotional intake as you truly do feel just about 'everything'. The Daniels have found such a creative & moving method to demonstrate a vast array of emotions, which never feels like it will teeter too far in one direction. An immeasurable sense of fun stays with you all the way through- that's a feeling I rarely get to experience in such a consistent manner where it lingers onward after the screening. An experience like this one has managed to carefully and cleverly infuse so many emotions to feel when watching EEAAO, which can be easily trace back to the craftsmanship of this film's directing duo. All the plethora of feelings to experience here are attributed by the amazing direction & writing from Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, who allowed themselves to let their creative juices flow so openly and freely. Perhaps the only gripe I would have is that a few minutes could have been shaved off, which may not seem like a major deal at first but at times a few minutes more or less in a film can make a huge difference. As I've mentioned before, the majority of the time (practically 100%) I enjoyed myself during the screening, but it did feel ever-so-slightly longer than it needed to be. For me this was a very minor dent in the overall experience but it was not enough to damage the massive enjoyment and thrill ride this film was.

With this film still being more of an indie flick, you would think there'd more limitations as to what they are able to do here, yet the production teams utilize what's available to them and more in order to create the wild spectacle presented to you. Both practical and special effects are demonstrated throughout the film, which is a quality that may go unappreciated at first but later on you could look back it and applaud for what these filmmakers had to work with. Budgets and finances for a film of this type don't usually happen often, but for the instance of EEAAO the money was used adequately across all areas whether it be production design, costumes, visual effects or sound. As an audience member, it's a great feeling when you see filmmakers like The Daniels who seemed to have used their film's budget wisely without making it look like they deliberately cut corners to save a few bucks. It's a discouraging feeling to go see a movie nowadays and you see a blatantly incomplete product right in front of you, especially, when you see the big price tag attached to the film. In the case of EEAAO, it looks like every dollar was spent accordingly and it feels as complete as it a film should be when you see it in a theater. On both the narrative and technical levels, a film of this nature finds itself in a cozy little spot to fully display its colors in the upmost confidence without damaging itself by means of nonsensicalness & outlandishness.

Besides the filmmakers and rest of the crew, a cast makes up the other majority of creativity power behind a film. And this cast... is OUTSTANDING!!! We have here a lively and energetic group of performers that give their everything in terms of delivering dimensional performances, plus the energy behind their performances shows just how much fun they seemed to have tremendous fun while making this film. Michelle Yeoh & Ke Huy Quan are the major standouts among this cast, but it wouldn't be fair to not mention performances from Stephanie Hsu & Jamie Lee Curtis who also give some notable performances. The leading lady herself, Michele Yeoh, truly shines as an actress with her continuously impressive physicality and emotional range with a character like Evelyn Wang. Making leaps and bounds across the multiverse, Yeoh seamlessly jumps between comedic and dramatic moments with each of those showing her 110% devotion to those moments. Alongside Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan makes an explosive return to the silver screen as an optimistic hearted and fun-loving character that serves as so much of the soul among the whole cast. As to the antagonist here, Stephanie Hsu's Joy Wang acts as a good clashing figure to go up against Michele Yeoh's Evelyn. Joy's character is complicated and emotionally resonating as someone simply wanting to be accepted and loved while understanding the craziness of the multiverse, which Hsu does exceedingly well. Plus it's amazing to seeing actresses Michele Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis being given the opportunity to play characters like these at their ages and show off just how badass they can be.

Creating something like EEAAO is a once in a lifetime kind of film where you get a meaningful and humorous story as well as a wildly entertaining spectacle that brings nothing but fun to all who watch it. A24 has done it once again as a studio known for creating new and original pieces that truly standout among the mass collective of films coming out every year. The Daniels have placed themselves in a special place in people's consciousness as filmmakers that will surely blow their minds with the unexpected and wildly creative imagination to come out of any two people's brains. It's an exciting opportunity to see cast of this caliber and creative vision this distinctive to shine as bright as it has in this very cluttered world.",9

Is this a one-star movie? Maybe.

Is this a ten star movie? Maybe.

Is Michelle Yeoh sure to win an Oscar with her role in this movie? Definitely maybe.

28 September 2022,It's not that confusing. Wholesome but no masterpiece.,"I mean, it is. Barely comprehensible. The weird sci-fi-but-not-really plot with its multiverse mechanics is full of inconsistencies and at its core, does not make any sense. While other movies and shows that tackle this kind of multiverse at least try to make it plausible, this movie does not give a damn, but it doesn't feel like a failure of the creators, but a deliberate attempt to make it as nonsensical as possible.

The focus clearly was on making it visually stunning, it's essentially just a series of completely random visually interesting events happening for two hours, lot's of weird stuff happening with slow motion effects. I usually roll my eyes at snobby film critic-type people telling me to just shut my brain off and enjoy a movie because its too stupid to enjoy otherwise, just because it has some pretentious theme or was made by some overhyped auteur, while in the same breath telling me how dumb your average Marvel popcorn flick is if you turn your brain on. But this is one of the few cases where I would actually agree. It's easy to miss out on what makes this movie good if you don't leave behind your rational mind at the entrance of the theater.

Because what saves the movie in my eyes are the simple themes of nihilism, optimism and optimistic nihilism at its core (""nothing matters, so we are free to be happy""), that are nicely brought together at the end. These are not very deep philosophical concepts, mind you, but presented in a very empathic way with believable emotions by very good actors, and going out it leaves you with a very wholesome feeling that other movies tackling similar themes fail to achieve.

What I really don't get is why the movies is so overhyped. I have revived my years old IMDB account specifically to give a more balanced take to the loads of ""best movie ever 10/10"" and ""didn't get it, too weird 2/10"" reviews.",7
11 May 2022,Best movies in years,"I rarely write a review for a movie but feel this one deserve it!

It is a messy, noisy, long movie. Maybe not for everyone.

But I just love it. Laughed loudly and cried tons at the same time.

Still think about the scenes the next morning when I woke up.

Haven't seen a movie like this in years!!

You have to go to the theater to figure out whether you love it or hate it :)

9 July 2022,Something different but is not a master piece,"The movie starts with a good idea, the multiverse but from a simple human perspective, however is not going to be the most transcendental or philosophical movie although in some parts make you think about the universe. It's more something developed towards comedy, to enjoy with family or friends.

The comedy that shows is very entertaining, it's easy to digest some jokes are very funny like Raccoon-touille, which is kind of a tribute to ratatouille. But in some parts the comedy goes for the easy laugh, a lot of physical jokes like peeing and some sexual connotations, like in the universe where people have hands with sausages instead of fingers. That comedy is accompanied with great costumes for the villainess, which are very creative, flamboyant and weird, and help us to understand what is happening in her conflicted mind.

The whole movie consists in three acts, introduction, where the hero discovers her powers and access some universes with the help of another traveler of universes. The middle in which the conflict arises, and confronts the villainess. And the final act with a heartwarming resolution.

While all this take place, the movie has decent shots of different universes but gets a little short in picturing the concept of infinity -yeah, I know that's quite a difficult one- but it compensates that with a crucial question, if you see the infinity what would happen, everything would matter or nothing would? Which is the conundrum proposed by the movie.

In summary, if you want to see something different with a plot related to family and love, with some philosophy on the side, this movie is for you. Instead, if you want a movie that questions the very fabric of reality, then continue searching for another sci-fi movie.",7
24 March 2023,Hollywood has lost its mind,"This movie could benevolently be described as an experiment in movie making. It has hardly any plot, copies from many different genres and is at times so hectic that it is hard to follow. In the end they try to tie it all together to a sentimental and nihilistic message about the value of relationships over accomplishments in life. As such, some people might enjoy it but my wife and I would have walked out if we had not been there with friends.

But I have a problem with all the accolades like the Oscars for best movie and for some of the actors. That used to mean something. But to call this the best of the year and to give Jamie Lee Curtis an award for this nothing of a performance shows how they have lost their way and the respect for their audience. They are mocking us. This movie is art in the sense that drawing a mustache on the Monas Lisa could be called art. Hollywood is hard at work of making itself irrelevant.

19 September 2022,Undeniably Unique,"Everything Everywhere All at Once proves itself to be an fantastic, immersive film. The direction stands out as some of the best I've seen in quite a while, with only an executiion as amazing as this being able to pull off this sort of wild ride of a film. The acting is really good, with Michelle Yeohn being an absolute blast throughout the film to watch. Along with this, all the other supporting actors are amazing and ultimately deserve Oscar nominations, no doubt. Overall, this movie is excellent, and I implore everyone to watch it. Nothing compares to it out there today, and I really do not you all to see it.

7 September 2022,"An imaginative concept, brilliantly played","It's not perfect, being just marginally too long, slightly repetitive, very nearly dragging in the middle, and not entirely clear about whether we should care about all fates in all multiverses.

But there's an awful lot to like here. A brilliantly bold and original concept, decent cinematography and effects, a sharp , nuanced script that both sets up and pays off, featuring well realised and believable characters, with a strong supporting cast. Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan both have a blast playing various versions of their characters, and James Hong is always great value.

Above all though, this film is about the phenomenal, poignant, delightful and absolutely captivating performance from Michelle Yeoh.

It's impossible to overstate just how hypnotically watchable Yeoh is, anchoring rather than owning every scene with presence, grace and generosity. Her character act is perfect, and she makes every scene entirely believable, no matter how absurdist the movie gets.

The very slight flaws can all be forgiven because of Yeoh's magnificent performance - you'll be utterly spellbound by every look, every gesture, every word, whether she's saving the multiverse, or doing her taxes.",9
20 May 2022,This movie has become one of my all-time favourite movies. I deem it a must-watch!,"It is long however, unlike many other movies, there are no parts I could pick to cut out. It keeps a brilliant balance between sci-fi/fantasy and being grounded in reality. Exploring the complex challenges of being an immigrant, family dynamics and that show kindness is not a weakness. The acting from all the actors is phenomenal, and trust me, these characters are no easy feat to achieve, yet these talented actors flowed through the roles, never making the illusion feel broken or disjointed. They take you through a roller coaster of emotions, making you want to cry, laugh, and re-evaluate your view on life in just the 2 hours it's on-screen. It is truly one of the most original, genuinely moving, and profoundly deep movies I have seen in a long time.

25 May 2022,"Soothing Edit, Effecting Fights & Everywhere Story","The most appealing part of the movie is its edit, really soothing especially when eyes are numbed by all those dumb videos. Nonetheless, piteously, the story undermines it like a dish cooked by an adroit chef, with a taste of nothing more than anything able to pass the esophagus. It feels as if the taste is not the meat, but the performance of the chef is. By the way, fight scenes are not bad, adequately catching eyes if they lust for droop, but don't expect that they will stay alert.

30 May 2022,Simple yet beautiful message disguised in overly chaotic plot. Worth the watch!,"Amidst all the chaotic scenes and verse jumping through the multiverse, the movie has a profoundly simple message. It's a journey of learning the roles we play in our own lives and in the lives of others close to us. Although the movie definitely was long and chaotic, it had me engaged the entire time. Some of the quotes in the film can hit the spot with the audience on a deeply spiritual level.

In conclusion, this is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time. Would definitely recommend this.

11 March 2023,Everything. Everywhere. All at Once even!,"Directed by the duo of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert--credited simply as ""Daniels"",--""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a masterpiece in distraction. It's like a magic trick which hides its shortcomings by overwhelming you with its originality-powered chaos. I could toss it aside by picking on its trickery, but that would be pique. I prefer to let myself go in its whimsical mish-mash creativity.

That being said, the movie's originality doesn't stand in it bringing anything new to the table, but rather in the way it mixes two aesthetic extremes. Michelle Yeoh start as Evelyn Wang, the owner of a laundromat living together with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), her father Gong Gong (James Hong) and her estranged daughter Joy (Stephaine Hsu). Their problems are as common as any small business owners: making ends meet and--guess what--taxes. Around the start of the movie, Michelle and her family heads over to the IRS office where she is confronted by Deirdre Beaubeirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis), an IRS inspector as bad as you would imagine. It is then when she is contacted by a different version of her husband from a parallel universe who briefs her about Jobu Tupaki, an evil spanning the multiverse who must be stopped at all costs. What? Did I lose you yet? No? Good. It's this steep curve in the plot which gives this movie its edge. It combines aesthetically modest and niche movies with sci-fi spectacle.

From there onwards, the movie revolves around themes of regret, love, tolerance and failure. Evelyn's familial issues continue except now she is also dealing with the new knowledge regarding the nature of reality. Still, there is no time to linger on deep philosophical questions; the fate of the entire universe--pardon me, multiverse--hangs in the balance. Chaos unfolds as the Daniels mercilessly make it rain with over-the-top action scenes and multiversal sequences which act as one of the funniest, over-the-top and original entertainment set-pieces I've seen in movies. Among all this chaos, Evelyn is the viewer's center. She quickly adapts to the conditions around her, something which depends on Yoeh's acting skills who is able to impose authority with a single look. She often pierces with a totalitarian gaze, cementing her as an A-list actress.

As for the aforementioned chaos, words would sell it short, but deep beneath its outlandish visuals, these action scenes are manifestations of large philosophical ideas involving the nature of chaos, the inevitability of destiny and what not--serious stuff.

But at the same time, the movie doesn't want you to linger on these larger-than-life ideas, and resisting its absurdism would be wrong. I am not going to resist pleasure; why should I, anyway?",8
10 December 2022,"too much of everything, get ready for a headache","Someone thought of a concept but mistook it for a script. Instead of a plot, the focus is on making every single scene looks like a masterpiece, resulting in a mess of things that have no cohesion between them, and worst of all, it's boring beyond belief. It kinda reminded me of my adhd room, where finding place for everything is almost impossible, unless that place is garbage bin. That's how pleasant it was. It's like someone trying to be creative, but lacking creativity, so they just pile everything they can think of, on top of everything else, overstimulating and tiring

For similar story but much more pleasing to the senses, go watch short film ""bao"" - you can even find it on youtube. It tells the same story, but in far less pretentious way, and since it's significantly shorter, you won't end up bored out of your wits.

19 May 2022,"The Real ""Multiverse of Madness""","If I can sum this movie up, it's about a mother who goes throughout the multiverse just so she can tell her father that her daughter is a lesbian.

Jokes aside, watching this movie is a really wild ride, more ""Multiverse of Madness"" than the movie that claims to be it by putting together all the wild fantasies about the different universes the filmakers have in mind while developing the script only to tell us that maybe, just maybe, the ordinary and mediocre life we have right now is the best one we can ask for out of the infinite multitude of choices we could have made, be thankful with what we already have right now, accept what and who our loved ones are along with their flaws. Thought it wouldn't be as simple as that in real life, taking the first step to improve our lifes will always be the best direction anyone can move towards.

8.5/10.

11 September 2022,Yes it's that good,"I happened to watch this on my last fight because I'd been hearing so much buzz around it. And WOW it really is as good as everyone has been saying. Over the 2 hours I laughed, I cried, I saw so much of myself in these characters. The gags, effects, and editing work flawlessly together and are a breath of fresh compared to other movies lately. It takes silly absurd concepts and made me openly weep, so much of this film resonated with me in such a deep existential way. It definitely felt like a labor of love by everyone who worked on it and I really think everyone should experience it.

I'm definitely going to try and see it in theaters before it leaves.

7 June 2023,"""An Unforgettable Journey Through Infinite Dimensions: 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' Delivers a Cinematic Triumph""","""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is an extraordinary cinematic experience that effortlessly weaves together multiple genres to create a truly unique and captivating film. Directed by the talented duo Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, also known as the Daniels, this movie showcases their visionary storytelling and inventive filmmaking techniques.

At the heart of the film is an outstanding performance by Michelle Yeoh, who shines as Evelyn, a woman who discovers the existence of multiple dimensions during a mystical event. Yeoh's portrayal is both powerful and heartfelt, as she effortlessly transitions between different versions of herself, each with their own distinct personality and strengths. Her character's journey is not only an exhilarating adventure but also a deeply emotional exploration of family, identity, and the interconnectedness of our existence.

The visuals in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" are a true feast for the eyes. The Daniels have crafted a visually stunning universe that seamlessly blends reality with imaginative and otherworldly elements. From mind-bending action sequences to breathtaking cinematography, every frame is meticulously composed and brimming with creativity.

The film strikes an impressive balance between genres, effortlessly blending elements of science fiction, action, and comedy. It keeps the audience on the edge of their seats with its thrilling and imaginative sequences while also infusing the story with moments of genuine humor and heartwarming emotion. The script is clever and engaging, providing a thought-provoking exploration of the nature of existence while also delivering a highly entertaining and enjoyable experience.

Supported by a talented ensemble cast that includes Awkwafina and Jamie Lee Curtis, the performances throughout the film are exceptional. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, and their commitment to their roles brings an authenticity that further enhances the immersive experience.

""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to new worlds and challenge our perceptions. With its dazzling visuals, brilliant performances, and a story that seamlessly blends genres, it is an absolute delight for moviegoers seeking a truly unique and mind-bending experience. Prepare to be swept away by this exceptional film that pushes boundaries and leaves a lasting impression.",10
1 May 2022,8.5 is my actual score,"Wow, this is a cinematic adventure to say the least! Being an A24 film is what initially intrigued me about this film bc other than SLICE and The Blackcoats Daughter, I've really enjoyed this film company's films. It's title is BEYOND appropriate because it encompasses soo much. This must've been an actors' dream job: showing so much range and wearing soo many different costumes. Yeoh is outrageously great, Hollywood should've put her in more varied roles previously. The humor could come off as juvenile at times (I'm personally not into anal play) and as others have said, the 3rd act is slightly long winded, but if you're open minded you definitely check this out!

11 April 2022,Michelle Yeoh and the Multiverse of Existentialism,"Does anything that has happened, is happening now, will or might happen mean anything on this small speck of dust in the tapestry that is our universe? No. No it doesn't. And if it doesn't, then what's the point of it all? Why are we even here? What does it matter what we do with the time that we have?

Existential questions like this have been plaguing me since March of 2020, and they are at the very heart of Everything Everywhere All At Once-a whacky, over-the-top, surreal masterpiece of an action-adventure-it dares to ask these questions, it doesn't pull it's punches, and apologetically answers with a tale as old as time:

Love.

And that is the word I have for this marvel of a movie. And, like Marvel, the plot takes us into the Mulitverse, but not with grand spectacle and superheroes, but with the mother of a teenager.

I've said it before, and I'll repeat it now-Michelle Yeoh, isn't just a national treasure for those countries she holds citizenship in, she's simply a treasure and has delivered, probably the best performance of the year in this movie.

The Daniels (Dan Kwan & Daniel Scheinert) continue to hit project after project out of the park, and I can't wait for what they have in store for us next.

There's one last person I need to talk about, and that is Ke Huy Quan, who returned to acting after finding fame as a child star in movies like The Goonies, and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and he is brilliant-and deserves all the awards as well.

On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being ""don't see this movie,"" and 10 being ""you should buy stock in it,"" I give it a 15.",10
23 August 2022,Completely Lives up to the Title,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is precisely that, it is a film that defies genres, melts minds and breaks hearts.

At its core, the film is a stirring family drama about the potential destructive nature of the intergenerational divide, particularly in immigrant families. But it is also a laugh out loud comedy, jaw-dropping martial arts film and mind-bending multiverse sci fi (eat your heart out Dr. Strange).

Absolutely incredible performances from an instantly recognisable and brilliant cast, and a rousing, atmospheric score by Son Lux are the cherry on the cake of my favourite film of 2022.

A must watch for anyone, especially when shared with family, friends or loved ones. You will laugh, cry, and surge with adrenaline, and when it's all over you'll want to watch it again.",10
22 March 2023,Over rated nonsense,"Painful to watch all the way through, could not wait for it to be over to be honest. Don't get sucked in by these so called intellectuals waffling on about some deeper meaning to it all. Many other films say something about the human condition in a far more coherent and intelligent way. This is a purile movie. The jokes could have been written by a ten year old. Its all over the place and dazzles your head but not in a good way. Hollywood has lost the plot. The worst so called best movie of the year I have seen by a mile. Give it a go, you will be exhausted by the experience. Its nowhere near what the smug critics say it is. Carry on like this and the Oscars will be meaningless.

22 June 2022,A perfect film!,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a unique movie, everything in it is perfect: the performances of the entire cast are wonderful, from leads to supporting cast, especially the performances of Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis. The script is innovative, deep and crazy, touching on dramatic elements and absurd comedy with a result of life learning accompanied by laughter. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's filmmaking is bold and effective, proving that two directors can make a quality film without a disastrous clash of ideas. The editing, costume design and production design are of remarkable quality. A modern classic!

2 July 2022,Just Excellent,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

25 April 2023,The ultimate emotional rollercoaster,"If you haven't watched it yet do yourself a favour watch this epic movie. It feels like you haven't watched like this one. It is a timeless classic you can't miss. I would like to bow that who had written it's screenplay. Kudos to the direction and technical department. It was well made and we'll produced movie.

Beside the acting was top notch . Michelle yeoh acting made you emotional, happy ,stunning. The supporting actor definately deserves an Oscar ke que huan made it already. All at once is the best part of the plot and everything is to introduce the world of the EEAAO. The genre shifting aspect made me very thought provoking. It was 20/10 actually.

15 September 2022,My kinda weird.,"I went in not knowing an awful lot about the movie thinking it was going to be some sort of sci-fi Kung fu action movie like those of the 00's, tho it does have elements of this, it was so much more. It was like watching one of the crazy dreams I have on a regular basis on the screen.

Acting, directing all great, the action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, dialogue is witty and funny. The acting is phenomenal by all, But the one thing that shocked me the most was how much heart and emotion the film has. Truly outstanding unique film that even tho it's over 2 hours long it flies by and has infinite rewatchability.

9 June 2022,One of the best movies of all time!,"This movie is funny, creative, different, refreshing, and emotional, all at once. It wasn't afraid to be different and not take itself too seriously. Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu were absolutely fantastic! Would definitely recommend this movie, and I can see this movie getting better with each watch. There's just so much to appreciate and enjoy.

10/10!

12 June 2022,Empty noisy immature film,"I went to see this yesterday evening and still can't get over how bad it was. The lack of skill demonstrated by the Daniels was very evident. It was noisy, hyperactive, childish, predictable and embarrassing to watch. It's getting a lot of positive reviews but it's not a quality movie by any stretch. The script is tedious and I felt for the actors as it's cringe worthy stuff. I took a chance by going but really should have left after a few minutes as from the off I could sense it wasn't going to be for me. It's in my top worst films I've seen in the cinema. Avoid.

19 May 2022,An incredible comedy,"This is the story of a woman who faces a person who looks like his husband but from an alternate universe. The man from another universe mentions that there is someone who plans to destroy all universes. The story is very innovative. Director did a really good job in this movie. The acting crew is amazing. Ke Huy Quan, Michelle Yeoh, and Stephanie Hsu are wonderful in this movie. The special effects were very nice. The fighting scenes are nice and full of Kung Fu. I recommend watching this movie to comedy and adventure fans.

29 October 2022,The most relatable movie I've seen,"I've always had the ever growing feeling of nonsense of everything surrounding me and my life went a bit out of its way to enforce this feeling throughout the years - I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way. I think I found my own, little, artificial sense of life and though it's no guarantee things will be easy, it's up to me to cling to it and hold on. This movie encourages me to do so, for which I'm very thankful.

It's humorous, wittingly constructed piece of beautiful and magical cinematography, to which I can relate on very deep level and which has moved me like maybe no other movie ever. It's cinema magic at its finest. I've never cried so much on a movie before, but it felt good, it felt cathartic. Though the actors and creators of this movie will never read this, I wanted to thank them, this movie has a soul of its own.

22 August 2022,Wow,"Truly, this movie is beautiful in every sense that it exists.

From the message of the film to the editing, the comedic timing to the gut punching moments, it's a movie to remember for a lifetime. Already with two watches in, I can say that this movie really has become a new favorite.

An absolute beautiful experience that's worth watching anywhere you possibly can.

It is everything everywhere all at once but never does it feel too much or lost at all, it all makes sense.

26 January 2023,Utterly brilliant,"Especially all the many jokes throughout. The production is totally trippy to the point that you need to watch it several times to really catch everything. The imagination in bringing this to fruition is amazing. The actual theme is very sweet as it is cleverly revealed at the end after all the marvellous shenanigans. A very smart classy film that may go down as a turning point in years to come, really hard to categorise although having much of the mysteriousness and imagination of a Matrix film, at the same time as very exquisite comedy. Full of surprises and delights. One imagines Terry Gilliam being a bit jealous he had no hand in it!

17 September 2022,So long...,"Everything all at once is well produced and has a good overlaying idea but unnecessary when it comes to so many other thing. If an honest discussion can be had, I would say something. But a one size fits all approach when it comes to entertainment just waters down everything. And made this movie feel long. Long as fu$k. The plot is good only if you know how to make it entertaining and to the point because the stupid movie comes off like it is several hours long. You even get sick of the action and just stop caring about the movie and the characters. Such a letdown. Anyone ranking this movie higher than a 7 is a liar.

30 June 2022,"Great job, Daniels","What an experience. Best movie I saw since 2019, with Parasite. I'm saying, this is cinema in its pure state. It's because of movies like this I love cinema.

Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert directed Swiss Army Man, one of the most creative movies of 2016, but in my opinion, it's limited by the need of explanations and very expository dialogues. But in Everything Everywhere All At Once, it's precisely proposed the lack of sense and logic, giving the gap to be debated philosophical questions and develop the relationship between the characters.

Evelyn is a tired, exhausted and unhappy woman because of the decisions she made and the life that these decisions resulted. She has many problems and you can understand these problems. And throughout the movie, when she is presented to the idea of multiverse, she realizes that even the worst version of us can be happy.

Michelle Yeoh. This person must win all possible acting awards. Yes, I'm talking about Oscar. His acting here is just the most perfect performance I saw in years. The scenes of kung fu, drama, comedy... She is just perfect in everything. With all due respect to Jessica Chastain and other Oscar winners, but THIS is an Oscar-worthy performance.

I want to highlight the work of editing, that's very important to organize all this multiversal mess and make that all these scenes in all these universes be fitted and connected by the message the movie wants to pass about identity, purpose, apprenticeship, family, to live the present, to forget the past, to not think about the future, to be satisfied by the life we have.

I don't know how someone can have the idea of making a movie like this. It's incredible how Daniels could make all these crazy parallels plots be so well-developed at the same time and pass so many lessons and messages all at once and that doesn't get tiresome (at least not for me). I think It's almost impossible what they make here, just a quite creative and genius mind could make this movie happen. It's because of guys like them that the cinema never dies.

A24, make this movie be in the Oscar!",10
4 October 2022,A spectacle with poignance,"Wow, this was a unique film, entertainingly presented and capitalizes on the amazing talent of Michelle Yeoh, supported by the ever-outstanding Jamie Lee Curtis. Both actors were, as perfectly expressed by another reviewer, ""glamoured down"", and the film was ""often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining"". I couldn't agree more, with that spot-on description, and found it thoroughly entertaining throughout its long run time. Worthy to be watched multiple times, I am looking forward to enjoying it again, as there is a lot to be picked up on with repeated viewing. As it poignantly explores the meaning of life, it is hilarious at times, making for an engaging experience.

12 August 2022,weird,"Few things in life are certain besides death, taxes, and maybe the never-ending task that is doing laundry. At least that's where the characters in writer/directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, new film ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" find themselves initially. That is, until they take an emotional, philosophical, and deeply weird trip through the looking glass into the multiverse and discover metaphysical wisdom along the way. In this love letter to genre cinema, Michelle Yeoh gives a virtuoso performance as Evelyn Wang, a weary owner of a laundromat under IRS audit. We first meet her enjoying a happy moment with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) and their daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). We see their smiling faces reflected in a mirror on their living room wall. As the camera literally zooms through the mirror, Evelyn's smile fades, now seated at a table awash with business receipts. She's preparing for a meeting with an auditor while simultaneously trying to cook food for a Chinese New Year party that will live up to the high standards of her visiting father Gong Gong. On top of juggling her father's visit and the tax audit, Evelyn's sullen daughter Joy wants to bring her girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel) to the party and her husband wants to talk about the state of their marriage. Just as Evelyn begins to feel overwhelmed by everything happening in her life she's visited by another version of Waymond from what he calls the Alpha verse. Here humans have learned to ""verse jump"" and are threatened by an omniverse agent of chaos known as Jobu Tupaki. Soon, Evelyn is thrust into a universe-hopping adventure that has her questioning everything she thought she knew about her life, her failures, and her love for her family. Most of the action is set in an IRS office building in Simi Valley (which, as a Californian, had me in stitches), where Evelyn must battle IRS agent Diedre (Jamie Lee Curtis, having the time of her life), a troop of security guards, and possibly everyone else she's ever met. Production designer Jason Kisvarday crafts a seemingly endless cubicle-filled office where everything from the blade of a paper trimmer to a butt plug shaped auditor of the year awards become fair game in a battle to save the universe. Moments of love and camaraderie. Sometimes they happen over time. Sometimes they happen all at once.",10
27 June 2022,Went in with no expectations and was completely rocked!,"This movie was above and beyond what i expected going into it. The premise was really interesting and well executed. They managed to talk about some deep concepts of humanity while still keeping it light hearted and comical. One of those few movies that actually manages to achieve serious with comedy at the same time without destroying the story or pace.

Definitely 10/10!

16 May 2023,Didn't intrigue me,"I thought that I somehow mistakenly watched another movie, not the highly praised & Oscar winning movie. How could this have won 7 Oscars, including the award for the best movie of the year?

I like Michelle Yeoh, also Jamie Lee Curtis. And the acting wasn't the problem at all, it was excellent. But, oh my, what a mess of a story. Already after first minutes, I felt like I'm not going to like this movie. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a chance. It won several Oscars so it must be good, right?

Wrong.

First of all, the movie is way too long. The constant changes of the universe as well as mix of English and Chinese made me lose focus. Sorry, but for me there were some other movies in 2022 that were better than this one.",4
24 September 2022,The title of the movie says it all,"Well, the title of the movie is not just about the movie. It makes you feel a lot of things simultaneously. Here let me just make it bit clear. At times in the movie you will feel great, energetic, motivated about life and what not, but at the same time few dialogues or scenes would make you feel exact opposite of it. I am not saying its depressing but it brings up the question ""nothing matters?"" and it makes you feel hopeless, useless but in a good way. Yes you heard me right but how can someone feel hopeless in a good way. Hence watch the movie, you will know what I am saying. I didn't knew the cast or anything about the other crew but everything was perfect.

It's that movie when you get out of the theatre and wonder what just happened. Am I doing the right things I must do.

17 September 2022,No one can say it's not original,"One thing that this movie can't be accused of is lack of originality, with the movie industry trend being to reuse content until it dries out, for sure a movie like this deserves credit.

It's a wild ride, prepare to be open minded during this trip and let yourself go with it in order to grasp the deeper message it conveys. Among all the crazy, it's clear there are some beautiful messages that I took from the film, do not stay stuck on thinking what your life could be and acknowledge its potential, in this mad Universe we are but tiny particles navigating through the cosmos in a rock, put things into perspective and realize that we do not matter that much to the Universe, be kind always and no matter how insane things get we can't help but stay close to the things and the people that truly matter.

So this for me was the movie strength, the powerful messages, the execution while original, amazingly well done and hats of to the whole cast, sometimes is just too weird. I get it, the possibilities are infinite in a multiverse concept but for humor purposes they showcase some really weird and nonsense stuff, which personally for me didn't quite work, but still most of the movie is highly engaging and as whole experience I really enjoyed it.

Thumbs up for having the guts of making the film partially spoken in a non-English language, we need more of that!",9
9 June 2022,The real Multiverse of Madness,"Not much to add to what's been said, other than anyone that wants to do a movie in this kind of genre should not only watch this movie but also study it. A truly masterpiece of its genre.

Might be confusing for some, make sure you watch it when you really feel like watching something this brilliant, it's definitely not your sunday lazy afternoon type of movie.

It's really Everything Everywhere All at Once and the fact that it was amateur people that did the VFX speaks volumes! So well done!

30 November 2022,Short Round's Redemption!,"I have left reviews on countless films that I have called ""quirky"", ""unique"" and ""ridiculous"". There is no film that first those descriptions more than Everything Everywhere All At Once. While the film is hilariously shocking, it is also action-packed and incredibly heartwarming.

This film has one of the most beautifully crafted messages that I have ever seen in film. I honestly cried for most of the last 30 minutes. If you can embrace the absurdities (or at least look past them), you will find a marvelous story about inner peace.

Best Character: Waymond Best Scene: The Fanny Pack Fight Best Quote: ""I will always, always want to be here with you."" - Evelyn Best Piece of Score: ""In Another Life""

24 June 2022,Not for people looking for a serious logical slow movie,"This movie is fast, it goes full throttle at the beginning and it never stops I understand how some people may be confused about it I can see my dad not understanding a single scene in this movie for example and call it rubbish but that is the case only for people that are just not capable of understanding or absorbing the randomness of this movie, not that it has a complicated plot, it is simply too random, and some people like random, some people don't, it's fine.

If you don't like random, skip this one it will be a 5/10 at most for you, if you do get ready for one hell of a ride, 8.5/10 for us.

18 January 2023,Unexpectedly hilarious and an emotional roller coaster,"I went into this movie thinking it would be emotional and thought-provoking. So, I was pleasantly surprised when the comedy showed up. This movie is so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh, so emotional that you can't help but cry, and so sublime that you can't help but want to rewatch it over and over again. The soundtrack is an ear massage. The visuals are good. The story is chaotic and strange; it's everything. The setting spans multiple alternate realities; it takes you everywhere. I imagine that people who prefer an ""organized"" movie may find this one difficult to watch and understand. The first 1/3 of the movie raises so many questions, but don't worry. Everything comes together at the end, all at once.

The jumping around in time got to be so confusing. The graphics were good but that's about it. Not sure how this movie won so many awards. I really enjoy Jamie Lee Curtis in other movies but have no idea how she won an Oscar for her performance in this movie. She wasn't on screen all that much. I think it was more of an ...well, she's been in a lot of movies, her parents are famous, let's give her an Oscar, she's getting old...And OMG, who in the world thought scenes with hot dog fingers would be a great idea??? The same person who thought watching rocks talk in subtitles would be a great idea. UGH Pass on this one, or watch the first hour and then decide if you want to invest more time.

24 April 2022,"Eccentric, exhausting and overwhelming adventure of sheer madness, but with a solid message at its core","An Asian woman who owns a laundromat that is dogged by tax auditors abruptly finds herself at the center of the most large-scale battle ever between good and evil spanning an infinite number of universes and alternate realities, one which ends up intertwining her meek husband, critical father and estranged, rebellious daughter. To go into too much detail about this extremely unusual plot would be unwise; it's best to go in cold and with no expectations. That way, you just might get the full effect.

For the most part, it's a fun film to watch, with surprising effects, jumping through different alternate realities coming together into one big plot. This movie keeps you on your toes with surprising ideas and sometimes unwanted or try-too-hard jokes, which can sometimes go too far for the average taste. The film's weirdness is its proud ethos; the mayhem and anarchy are the film's heart and soul. The meandering, unwieldy narrative actually fits in with the unstructured multiverse. But underneath the film's chaos, lack of logic and unapologetic absurdity, lies a twofold wholesome principle: believing in the strength of the mother-child bond and finding the good in every individual, in spite of the world's cruelty and insanity. For all the film's unruliness, there's nothing remotely misanthropic here. Far from being a grim morality tale, it's more along the lines of hard-earned wisdom. Once you understand it in that regard, it's safe to say it will stay with you.

Michelle Yeoh as the protagonist Evelyn just crushes it again; she has proven to be one of the most underrated actresses for quite some years now and with an incredibly vast range of acting. In this film, she turns an unremarkable, workaday character into a bona fide superhero whose abilities might have no limit whatsoever. Fair warning: This film will be an endurance test for some, but not without a hilarious and/or philosophical respite here and there. Recommended for everyone who wants to stretch their comfort zone of the familiar way of movies and is up for something truly different and off the beaten path.",8
26 June 2022,Good to be here.,"There is a universe with a better version of this movie, but this one is good enough.

If you haven't watched this movie, you're just that version of yourself.

If you did watch this movie, and it opened some of your eyes, good for you.

Now do what you do.

7 March 2023,In another time...,"In another time, I would hate this movie with a passion. HOWEVER in this reality, I feel like this movie is a MASTERPIECE. So I understand why so many people hate it in the reviews, but luckily I am on the side of the many more people who think it is one of the greatest movies ever made. I feel bad for the people who cannot appreciate and see how brilliant the movie really is. In their reality, I am sure they feel bad for me. What I can say for certain, is that I have shown this movie to many family and friends, and those few who I thought would really love it- were confused and not impressed; but the many more I thought would not get it- they loved it and even cried. I kinda think that haters are just haters and think they are too sophisticated to simply get how deep this movie really is. This movie is number 5 on my all-time favorite list, just behind 'Life is Beautiful' and above 'Life of Pi'. I have seen this movie so many times, and it still can make me laugh and cry harder than any other movie I have ever seen in my life. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

19 June 2022,lol this film is so bad,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",5
15 June 2022,An iconic and incredibly unique film.,"Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) follows a woman struggling with day to day life, who soon finds that the fate of her universe, and all of the multiverses, are in her hands. I enjoyed this film a lot! It was so much fun and had a lot of emotional weight to it, I'm glad it's getting the attention it deserves.

The cinematography for this film was truly brilliant, and I can't even pick some shots that stuck out simply because ALL of them did! It's so visually pleasing and really pops, definitely worth seeing in cinemas for the visuals alone. I really used the advantage of having different cinematography for each universe very well.

A big stand out for me were the characters and their actors. The film is packed full of character development that is well written, and realistic relationships between them. Ke Huy Quan absolutely stole the show as Waymond, his character was so pure of heart and it was IMPOSSIBLE to dislike him.

The humour is very slapstick and silly, which works most of the time! However, some of the jokes got a bit repetitive for me. I understand how people may like this though so I just think that's my preference!

The score was amazing too, and so energetic! I loved listening to it, it added so much chaotic energy to the action sequences and really helped to keep my interest constantly. It's used very tastefully too, with more slow tracks used in mellow scenes.

Lastly, the pacing is good and is king enough to flesh out the story and plot properly! I liked how it was split up into sections that explain the title, and it was very clear in it's storytelling. It dragged a little bit, but I wouldn't say it's much of an issue at all.",9

An incredibly original film that uses the concept of the multiverse to its fullest potential. It's bizarreness can be off putting a times but Daniel keeps you grounded with a relatable story of what if's and powerful performances. Every time I started to feel like I was being taken out of the movie, I was drawn back in.

In a lot of ways this movie perfectly capture the pandemic era existential anxiety and depression I've experienced recently as well as some of the complex and deep rooted frustration I've had with my family. I cried, I laughed and at times I cringed. But I have to say this was one of my favorite theatre experiences. Whether you'll end up loving it or hating it, I recommend everyone experience it.

14 April 2022,Weird as hell and all the better for it! Michelle Yeoh is a revelation!,"It does all become a bit too much on more than one occasion, threatening to be sucked into its own literal bagel of ridiculousness.

But it's really just, such a pleasure to watch filmmakers genuinely passionate about their craft craft, delivering what may be the biggest and boldest...um 'absurdist multiverse-comedy/martial arts action-adventure/family-drama with I think some musical in there, ever made.

No one can accuse this team of not knowing EXACTLY what kind of movie they are making and beyond that... it's actually quite hard to define just how Goddamn entertaining it all is. Laugh out loud hilarious, weird as hell, action-packed bonanza with superb storytelling and characters.

Michelle Yeoh is outstanding as Evelyn (every version of her), Stephanie Hsu is an intoxicating delight and the entire team commit 100% to this ... LITERAL BAGEL of freakin' what.

Though where it holds strongest, from start to (almost) finish is its journey through the complex and unyielding dynamics of mothers and daughters. The times 'Everything, Everywhere' wants to hold your attention most, is when all the bells and whistles and sausage fingers are lowered and it becomes about two people, trying to make sense of it all.",9
20 November 2022,Wow this was refreshing,"Journey from trying to find what you love, to trying to love what you find :-) Imagination, beauty, questions about self and existence, and realization of it, magically weaved into a wacky story.

Never easy to bring a refreshing take on this topic without saying what has already been said or done before, hence this is truly well achieved, this was refreshing, funny as well as thought provoking.

Michelle Yeoh is just amazing, I grew up watching her, so it's always a pleasure see her again, cannot imagine this movie without her. And so goes for rest of the cast.

Need more of this, art of serious reflection without being serious üòä

11 April 2023,An wild ride and a good cry,"Everyone everywhere had told me that this film would make me cry. I believed them, but was unaware of the waves of emotions, tears, and choked back sobs a movie could elicit. Hsu and Yeoh have such intense chemistry that watching this film was like experiencing a healing therapy session for my past self- as an angsty teen- and my future self- as a flawed but loving parent. And the craziest part? Between my sobs I was hysterically laughing at the absurd and witty comedy, which somehow made my cries even more intense. An absolute piece of art, perfectly crafted to blow my mind.

Cons: A tad bit cheesy near the end, but, honestly, the good kind of cheesy.

10 June 2022,I love this movie,"I was excited to see this from the get go (because of my longstanding adoration of Michelle Yeoh since childhood), but I had to temper myself and not get too overexcited to avoid my expectations being too high and ruin the experience of watching it. Overhype can be a bummer sometimes. But I honestly could've doubled it and still be taken aback! This was an effing awesome movie. It was everything I thought it can be and more. It was brilliant. Simply brilliant.

15 May 2022,Left me speechless and teary,"Surreal sci-fi action movie with lots of lol and wtf moments with time for great character development. Glad to see an 80s child star return to the big screen. Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis are perfectly matched supported by the legendary James Hong Stephanie Ann Hsu, but Stephanie Ann Hsu is awesome. She is one of the new generation Asian actresses that can play multifaceted acultural roles like Awkwafina and Gemma Chan. Hopefully they will get more roles that do not pigeonhole them into just 'Asian' characters.

14 May 2023,Innovative dark humor action surrealist movie,"Ery innovative and technically well done film. I considered that edition and art direction were particularly amazing. Besides that, actors showed themselves quite versatile. It is a dark humor action surrealist movie, winner of multiple Oscar prizes. I may partially describe it as Matrix meets Parasite meets Monty Pyton meets Jackie Chan meets Rattatoille meets Zero Theorem meets Spider-Man into the Spider-verse. Every single choice destroys infinite alternative possibilities. What if each family frustration repeated in all possibilities. Chaos, pastiche, existentialism, fun, everything all at once.

9 June 2022,My Favorite Movie of the Year!!!,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",10
13 March 2023,This is why awards are meaningless,"Everything Everywhere All at Once was nominated for 11 Oscars and just won 7 recently. I immediately thought to myself that I have to watch this movie, something with this many awards can't be bad right?

Well, I was wrong.

The movie is trying to be outrageous in any possible opportunity just to be unique, but it tells the same story that is often recurring in Hollywood movies: the hard life of the minorities living in America. The jokes are rather unfunny, the plot is progressing super slow, and the edits are all over the place.

The only thing that went well for this movie is the casting. Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis and Michelle Yeoh did absolutely deserve Oscars for their performance.

To conclude this review, here is a little fun fact: EEAAO has recently become the most-awarded movie ever (yes even more than The Return of the King). If this isn't an indication of how useless awards have become, I don't know what is.",1
23 September 2022,A joy to our senses,"EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, 2022) is, above all, a breathtaking cinematic experience, which summons almost all of our senses to enjoy it in its fullness.

Michelle Yeoh leads with unshakable mastery the group of no less efficient actors who transpose the Daniels' vision to the big screen. Newcomer Stephanie Hsu is surprisingly convincing in the role of Jabu Tupaki; Ke Huy Quan (the boy from INDIANA JONES AND THE LOST TEMPLE and THE GOONIES) proves to be a talented and versatile actor; in turn, the legendary James Hong, who is already 93 years old, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who manages to be, at the same time, hateful, comical and touching, show that without committal and without complexes, as in any profession, there is no way to get good results.

The film itself requires concentration and open-mindedness, as it is unlike anything I've ever seen. Assuming that there are several universes and that it is possible to jump from side to side, accessing the selves of other universes, the story unfolds at a hallucinating, captivating, touching and even philosophical pace, launching lines of thought such as ""Nothing matters"" ; ""kindness"" as a form of struggle; see the good side of things as a life strategy, not necessarily as naivety. Almost from an existentialist or Beckettian perspective, we can consider that what the film proposes is that at the base of our existence there is nothing and it is our choices and the freedom to choose some things over others that define the human condition.

The film uses impressive special effects, which serve the story, but without neglecting the message it intends to convey. And here, the one that seems to me the most profound is related to the fact that the protagonist believes that she has done nothing with her life, because when she gets to know her other selves from other universes, she considers that they had fuller and more interesting lives (although they lacked the most important thing: a family). In fact, when someone tells the protagonist ""in another life, I would have loved to do laundry and taxes with you"", we have the film deciphered.",10
20 May 2022,The actual Multiverse of Madness,"Ohh WTH did i just watch. This is a really heavy movie to finish. There are a lot of things happening throughout the movie. It's actually the multiverse of madness.

I don't know where to start. But one thing i am gonna say is you might actually not like the movie but you would appreciate what they have done with it.

I just wanna say kudos to the directors of the movie. It's really not an easy movie to make and they handled it pretty well. There are so so many scenes to shoot and edit & add & they actually did it and they deserve all the praise.

In the end all i will say is watch and decide if you wanna like it or not,but appreciate it.

18 April 2022,An emotional and philosophical ride on the roller coaster that is life,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" takes its unsuspecting viewers on a soul wrenching journey and takes no precaution in warning them before taking their beating heart right out of their chest, throwing it down on the floor, stomping on it and then putting it back into their chest and giving them a peck on the forehead.

This magnificent piece of art perfectly captures the essence of life. It does so in a subtle and elegant way. It lets its audience guessing the meaning of its scenes and events without ever saying it outright.

It was the first time I cried in a movie theatre. ""Crying"" being an understatement as I was literally bawling my eyes out multiple times throughout the ride. I was not an exception, people were as devastated as I was.

Although ""Everything everywhere all at once"" makes you go through the roughest of journeys, it makes sure to make you leave the movie theatre at peace and ready to conquer life. As people left the room, I heard nothing but praises.

I do not want to call this masterpiece a movie as it would minimize the life-changing power that it holds. This is, without any near competition, the best cinematic experience of my life. I had never experienced something so deep, emotional and philosophical adressed in such a smart, subtle and elegant way. Its mere existence baffles me as it exceeds my high standards and earns itself one of the very few 10/10 I've ever given.",10
17 December 2022,Magnificent.........,"Everything Everywhere All At Once has successfully done a very rare opportunity. This film gets to call itself the best film of its genera. To me, this is by far the best multiverse film I have ever seen by a long shot. Everything Everywhere All At Once I'd A24's adult Pixar film. To me it reminded me of a pixar film but for adults. The themes and lessons learned in this film were brought perfectly to light. The comedy was always on point and hilarious. And the special effects feel like a new look over other effects. A24 has done some terrific things but this was one of there best. Overall the action, comedy, emotion, and visual and practical effects were fantastic along with all of its actors and I will love to see it again.

Everything about it is beautiful, perfectly wacky, perfectly executed, and the story is incredible. No film can be compared with this one, as they are all vastly inferior to this masterpiece. The acting was all phenomenal. The audio is so good it is inexplicable. If you haven't seen it yet, do not watch a trailer, just hit play and enjoy the awesomeness.

20 May 2022,The Emperor has no clothes,"Having just watched this, I don't get the positive reviews.

It was a tedious mess, not to mention way too long. It wasn't anywhere near as clever or funny as it seemed to think it was.

The characters were underdeveloped, the story poorly explained. Technically it was well made, and some sequences were fun, but I never felt engaged by it at all. Fair play to the actors, who all seemed to giving it their all, what a shame it wasn't a better movie.

This one doesn't live up to the hype, sorry.

3 June 2022,The result of a big blender of ideas,"This film certainly lives up to its title, almost resembling the dense but vaguely defined bagel of doom featured so heavily in the story. In an impressive act of creativity and filming techniques from a limited crew, Everything Everywhere All at Once features an incredible myriad of visual ideas and alternate characters that all serve common themes. Near the beginning, the execution was nearly flawless - we get to know Evelyn and her daughter Joy, there is a palpable sense of mystery and creative fight scenes bring in the multiverse concept. Later on, however, the film gets bogged down with too many sides to each fight, very slow pacing and weaving too many thematic threads back together. One theme is intergenerational acceptance, which has been common in recent films like Encanto and Turning Red. Another is battling nihilism by choosing to love specific individuals, much like the rose in The Little Prince. Others include enjoying the surrealism of the universe, being comfortable with our choices and exploring the opportunities in front of us. By the end, the bagel that is Everything Everywhere All at Once has become overloaded.",8
21 May 2022,"Full of creativity, but probably not for everyone","Many people complain that most current movies are formulaic. Well, here is a film that is most definitely not.

Bursting with creativity and ideas, ranging from the heartfelt to the absurd, it occasionally presents the viewer with a formulaic setup, only to pull the rug from under your feet and shout ""fooled you"" with manic glee.

It is this strategy that may also be its weakness. I really liked the movie, but my wife hated it. It is definitely not for everyone. If the viewer wants a clear, straight-forward narrative, then they will be only find frustration here.

If I had one criticism, I believe the film to be about 30 minutes too long. But in the great scheme of things, it is a small gripe.

Please go and support film-making that breaks conventions. With an open mind, you won't regret it.",8
22 March 2023,Incredible movie,"The movie was incredible at invoking ever emotion. You could be close to tears and happiness in one scene and 30 seconds later be laughing in a clever way. It had multiple life lessons which really made you think in a positive way. It was entertaining through out the whole movie and there was no dull moments. The acting buy all the characters was very good with incredible comic relief. This had to be one of my favorite movies that I have seen in a while. It was one of my favorites as it was unpredictable, thoughtful and no major plot holes that I could see. I would highly recommend this movie.

5 February 2023,Upside Down and Downside up,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is a movie that starts by painting a lot of chaos around you and makes you sit exactly at the center of it. Right off the bat, it introduces too many characters which then introduces the plot which then pushes the story forward and it keeps going on unless it overwhelms you with its sheer size of concept. Actors starting from Michelle Yeoh to Ke Huy Quan to Jamie Lee Curtis and everyone else have done such a phenomenal job with their performance that it just makes you want to focus on the story going forward and forget everything else. The story itself from start to end stays very chaotic but even among that it manages to express itself beautifully. Editing, cinematography, and other departments have put in so much staggering work that your wondering just doesn't stop at all. Directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have created a harmony that has too many things stacked and packed in it but the way they have delivered it on the plate with a desert, in the end, is enough to keep you sitting until the end to taste it. All in all, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a movie that you will probably witness once in your life but you will surely don't wanna let that be your last time.",8
30 April 2022,Matrix/Being John Malkovich on Robot Chicken,"Hi, I work in film/tv. If Michelle Yeoh doesn't bare minimum receive an Oscar nomination along with the Writers and Directors and Editing for this film, then there needs to be some serious discussion about what we are all doing here to begin with.

This movie makes you feel and also helps people understand other people on top of this being incredibly entertaining. It is hard to put this into a genre. I was blown away and walked out crying because it was so great from the theater.

How much genius can one film project???

And Yeoh, there is also awesome martial arts!!!

3 August 2022,I wasn't prepared for this movie.,"Nothing could have prepared me for it.

I knew a few basic plot points, and I'd seen the trailer, and I'd heard the praise. Praise is usually a bad thing for me, because I get overhyped for movies very easily and it's rare they live up to my expectation.

And yet, I was still not prepared for this movie.

I pity the people who hear about this movie in broken fragments from friends, who have its best moments spoiled by memes, who will never experience the sheer joy of being blindsided unaware by this movie's brand of chaotic, loving insanity.

It is better that I was not prepared, because this movie pried open my heart and shook my soul.

12 March 2023,Don't know What All The Hype Was About,"After all the hype praise and awards that this movie received I just got curious and decided to watch this movie for myself when the opportunity came up. I can't even remember the last time I was so bored and disappointed after watching this movie. Talk about Overhyped. I should have learned a lesson the last time when I went to see the last movie that received so much attention and didn't live up to the hype the name of that movie was Smile I do get the concept though the bottom line is the root of this movie is just about the dynamics between the mother and her daughter and the emotions surrounding that I watched this movie and all got from it was this huge jumbled mess. It's just a whole mass of different scenes or scenarios jumping from one scene to the next without giving one a chance to invest in any of the characters. There wasn't a whole lot of depth to it either The Parallel universe angle was kind of tacky in my books. I only gave 3 stars for this because the leading actress Michelle Yeoh does look sexy in all the fight scenes but apart from that, I didn't like this at all.

The casting is superb. Michelle Yeoh absolutely excels. The back-up casting is fantastic too. The kung-fu sequences are excellent. The script and dialogue is articulate and mature.

Cinematography just absolutely blew me away. Some of the best camera work i've seen this year. The CGI aspect is stunning. It's an absolutely bonkers film with a heart-warming message! Easily the best movie out this year so far!

Off to seek out the directors other works and to look up the cinematographer. An absolutely superb film!

20 March 2023,Greatest film about multiverse,"Warning: it's totally collapse, guys. When watching a movie, you chew it up, try to understand, go deeper. Here the situation is exactly the opposite - the film chews YOU up, arranging a brainstorming session, and you don't mind. I think that the film is the CULMINATION of the MULTIVERSE - forget what you saw with Marvel sauce or other nonsense. No movie that will be released after and will be tied to the multiverse WILL SURPASS ""Everything everywhere and at once"".

It's hard for me to explain in words how I was shocked by the graphics and the story in this film, since it's easier to see for yourself. The main thing is not to watch this movie in the background - you have to be vigilant here, because you miss a detail, and the whole card pyramid will fall. Yes, the foundation is simple, about the barrier between the younger and older generation, and how it is served - please be silent, just watch.

Then watch it again so you can understand how tightly written and acted this film truly is. Seriously, movies like this is why movies and theaters will never go out of business. You need a big screen and a live audience to truly appreciate the bonding experience of artistic accomplishment.

24 April 2023,"Frenetic, funny and visually clever","A fast paced, funny, absurd, sometimes confusing whirlwind of a movie. The actors all accomplish the trick of portraying varying versions of themselves and carrying the ambitious storyline -- that there are as many versions of us as individuals as there are universes in the chaotic maelstrom of a quantum metaverse. It's hard to keep track of the silliness, but always amusing and thought provoking, and both Ke Huy Quan (who to those of us of a certain age will always be Short Round from Indiana Jones) and Jamie Lee Curtis give the fantastic Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu the backup needed to keep the whole mad movie going. Wonderful stuff, really. Sharp, witty, fast-paced, endlessly visually inventive, and moving.

21 October 2022,Best picture science fiction movie for the first time!,"Where do I start?

I could write a lot of words who could try to the describe this movie but I can assure you that I wont Succeed.

I will start with the most significant saying.

This movie changed everything that I taught about science fiction movies.

I always assume that although science fiction movies are fun to watch it will never give me feelings or will get the impact that a drama movie will give me but this movie is the evidence that this stereotype, about science fiction movies, is wrong.

It's funny that although the plot looks so tricky and complicated at the end the plot describe something very simple (or actually more complicated), mother and daughter relationship and add some generation gap for the twist, yeah probable the meaning of the universe is simpler than that topic.

Beyond the magnificent plot we have the two main role actors.

Both of them gave us an outstanding performance And even made me pour some tears at the end.

I have to say that in my opinion the actor who played the dad will get an Oscar for his performance.",8
12 April 2022,I will never get over this movie,"Hilarious and action-packed with one of, if not, THE most emotionally resonant message I've ever seen. This movie is well paced, well acted, well edited, well everything, everywhere, all at once. I'd just about say it's perfect, it's so polished. The last 30ish minutes were emotional blow after emotional blow, with well timed little pauses for a breather and joke in-between. I love this. I won't be able to stop thinking about this anytime soon, if ever.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

12 June 2022,One of the greatest films in recent memory,"I seldom write IMDb reviews. Even rarer that I write them for a movie I enjoyed. That I am speaks volumes about how fantastic this film is.

I've seen a lot of movies. Including most of the top 100 films of all time (according to IMDb). This movie easily deserve a place among those. It's witty and funny while simultaneously poignant and thoughtful.

It's a rare movie where I walk out gushing like this. You deserve to see it unspoiled - go see it.

2 September 2022,"Psychotic, creative, incredible!!","Michelle Yeoh: is a bad ass.

Jamie's relatively small part was a stroke of casting genius. She smashed it. Literally.

Whilst nightmarish in places, the originality is outstanding. I found myself thinking about the person or persons who thought this up, and that they could very well be in straitjacket/s somewhere but, man alive, I am in awe of their talent.

A surreal, vast, almost operatic film with beautifully choreographed action, quirky and hilariously comedic throughout üëÄ.

As a person who cannot leave a chemist without buying yet another lip balm (seriously, I've got, like, hundreds of them) I'll never look at them in quite the same way again.

What an unexpected gem of a movie. I loved it.

10/10.",10
4 June 2022,I hate this movie!!,"I really, really do. Not cause it's bad, boring or pointless. Quite the opposite. It's because it makes me think and because it's so good in achieving what it aims to.

On the surface it's an action comedy flick about middle-aged mother struggling with her everyday life and connection that she's rapidly losing with her daughter. All in the pseudo sci-fi theme of multiverse.

But that's just the surface.

I may be overinterpreting but I see Everything Everywhere All at Once as a trifold... For one, and most of all, a story about depression, struggling with one's identity and acceptance among those who should give it unconditionally. And depression is a difficult thing to live with. Diagnosed or not, it often holds a stigma of an excuse and some of those who lack empathy to comprehend its meaning tend to dismiss it as everything else other than it really is. And then there's also a theme of a change. That no matter how grounded we are in our beliefs, our outlook on life and rules the World is guided with, we should never stop questioning them and looking at every situation from all available angles. Because perhaps, what we consider good, right and appropriate may very well be precisely opposite and just not visible from the bubble of our perception that we're locking ourselves in. And last but not least, it's about dropping all the prejudices, all the opinions based on what we heard, read or saw and just making our own. Based on how things really are and not how they're depicted by others (or even media, but that's more of my observation than what's in the movie). After all, most people are good people who just made the wrong turn, willingly or otherwise, somewhere in their life and even though they may appear to be bad or beyond saving but hardly ever it is the case. One just needs to leave one's own comfort behind and just make that extra effort.

So yeah, I hate this movie because of what it did to me. But I also love it for what it may do, what it may mean, if more people would see it. And even if only some of them will take that extra minute or two, to try to understand what they really saw afterwards and reflect. It will be a success. For humanity.",10

23 July 2022,An exciting surprise,"A totally crazy and highly original film carried by a Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies, The Lady) at the top of her form. She is simply sublime.

The cast is excellent. We are pleased to see Ke Huy Quan (The Goonies, I. Jones and the Temple of Doom) and an unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis as a tax inspector.

The editing of the film is extraordinary and deserves to be rewarded. Moreover I would see this film nominated for editing, screenplay, directing and acting at the next Oscars.

25 December 2022,"Gloriously Inventive, Fun And Truthful","When a writer has apparently thrown every conceivable idea at a screenplay it's an incoherent mess. This film works so perfectly that by the time a small dog is being used as an assault weapon and inadvertently gets stuck in a fridge, even this dog-lover and his also dog-lover wife were howling with laughter and joy. What a deliriously inventive and fun film this is.

But, of course, it's not only that - as if that wasn't enough. It's also got much to say about how we see ourselves, each other and our relationship - and manages to do so without feeling overly sentimental or heavy-handed.

The performances are whole-hearted and spectacular, with inevitable special reference to Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The direction and writing are similarly superb; really there's not a department of this film that isn't working brilliantly, in sync with all the rest. It's a more warm-hearted, emotionally connected Inception; it's life-affirming and hopeful, whilst true to pain. We all need it in our lives.",9
13 February 2023,Here's why IMDb score isn't trustable anymore.,"If you choose to see this movie because IMDb high score, or you heard in the news it was the 1st candidate to win the Oscar for best Picture, then you're not the only one.

This movie physically hurt to watch. I mean it. Some one took large quantities of cheap LSD eventually cause them a ""bad trip"". This movie is boring, so dull, I can't remember the last time I decided to stop watching a movie. After 30/40min I was already having fun in my phone completely disconnected with this movie.

Let's just pretend you are looking to see a new movie, and you decide in order to choose the right vibe of the movie you want to see the trailers.

If you weren't convinced about this trailer you probably not gotta like this one either.

Just go and watch and put write your opinion here.",1
1 March 2023,What an experience.,"I do not exaggerate and I do not lie when I say that this film is the greatest film I have seen in my entire lifetime. The term ""Must See"" is a phrase that gets used incorrectly way too many times; but, ""Must See"" in my personal opinion now only applies to this film. I undoubtedly believe that this will be studied at the collegiate level for years to come. Nearly every emotion is felt while watching this film. From the action, to the laughter, to the sorrow, to the intellectual depth of this film, it's a ride you won't want to get off of. No other actress in our current era could have done such an extraordinary performance as Michelle Yeoh.

26 August 2022,My favorite movie of the last decade,"I don't want to give anything away so I will simply say: this movie is beautiful, poignant, hilarious, action packed, well acted, well written, surprising, and an all around pleasure to watch. Favorable comparisons to both eternal sunshine of the spotless mind AND Big trouble in little china (with 90 year old James Hong! Still being awesome!). Do yourself a favor and make time to really take this movie in without interruption!

30 June 2022,Novel type of chaos,"I think the rating of this film depends a bit on the angle that one wants to emphasize along some traditional rating axes: In terms of a story, the narration disorients the viewer constantly, baiting them into believing ""the movie is about *that*"" and then taking it away again. In the end, some viewers might find that it wasn't really about anything, in a straightforward kind of manner. In this regard I might give it a 7.

From a novelty standpoint, I think it's really a fantastic piece of art, somewhere at a solid 9. We've seen multiverse stuff going to the extreme, e.g. In Rick and Morty, where nihilism, metafiction, and identity play a role as well and the ""everything happens"" part is interpreted in a very, very literal way, but much more doesn't come to my mind. Moreover, in non-cartoon cinema, it really feels like a first. The shots where they cycled through what felt like a good 100 frames of different incarnations of the main character where crazy, not just from an editing point of view but just as the experience of the viewer. It literally feels dizzying to watch it, particularly on a large screen.

For the themes, the directors didn't shy away from ambitiously trying to incorporate many layers (as far as I interpret it). One obvious aspect is the Asian-American experience that is highlighted a bunch in the beginning. As Anne Anlin Cheng put it, the movie plays with the Asian pendent of Afro-pessimism (which has gained some traction recently), Asian-pessimism. I'm sure she would have a lot to say about it, and I can only figure how in analogy to Afro-pessimism, the confrontation in the film tries to stipulate the 'yellow woman' as Cheng might posit the Asian body as she does in her work, as a mode of transport of vaguely liberal identity-based analysis (similar to the slightly topical book by Charles Yu, Interior Chinatown, 2020). This mode of transport is questioned and in the film ultimately left only touched upon (e.g. The scene of the hot dog universe where the main character has a relationship with the tax accountant), emphasizing the internal redemption with her daughter.

Another more or less straightforward interpretation is the depression mother and daughter go through, most of the imagery serving as an underscore of the various facets of said depression. Not only does nothing matter, but while it seems to matter, we witness its decay, the horrid circumstances that lead us down the path to death (the bagel as a dadaist-nihilist image), even making redemption ultimately impossible. Unless, well, spoiler alert, in the end redemption was possible in some sort of Dan Harmon-esque ""let's watch TV and not bother"" way.

One last bit that I really liked was the metafictional scenes, where the main character was playing herself, dragging me, the audience, literally into the boat, making us think about our own place in the multiverse. Ending the film with some credits in the middle of it (as did The Simpsons in the The Simpsons movie) was great and works every time for me, even though some viewers might find it a bit trite.

All in all it's really worthwhile, even if you are not into (vaguely) experimental stuff. There are so many themes going on that there will be enough to talk about for everyone. And if you hate overinterpreted/overinterpretable postmodern cinema, watch it for the crazy-ass pictures and fantastic soundtrack.",8
15 April 2022,Like being assaulted,"So horrible it defies description. Imagine getting mugged, then running into the street to flag down a car but instead of stopping, the car runs over you. Then backs up so they can run over you again. Then the paramedics show up and they throw you off a ten story building.

16 March 2023,Loved this and everything it is,"As someone with CPTSD that constantly has flashbacks and nightmares... + is estranged from my abusive mother who I've envisioned what it'd be like and what I'd be like if I didn't grow up with her as she is, and envisioned all the possibilities she could've been...as well as the possibilities of not recreating those traumas in relationships...this movie really touched me to my core.

I don't think I've been so impacted by something and this is truly a masterpiece.

I don't understand any of the reviews who were bored, what movie were they watching?! I was constantly entertained and there was something new to look at almost every moment, I liked the pacing and I'm sure that was hard to pull all these many many many pieces together, I'm truly in awe of what they did. Whoever edited this is a master.

The Dad was also the sweetest person and some of his lines will be stuck with me forever.

The performances are stellar, the direction must've been a feat but they pulled it off flawlessly, and everyone deserved awards for this.

Maybe it isn't for everyone, but it very much is for me and I look forward to seeing it again and again.",10
6 March 2023,Deeply wierd,"Deeply wierd in a way that only a quantum interpretation of a multiple universe theory of everything could aspire too. Evil donuts, sausage fingers and chinese takeaway created a culinary backdrop for relationship wins and fails. I think it was basically my beautiful launderette, but re-imagined after a seriously illegal party... a party like Matt and Boris would have had if there were no moral checks or consequences. I watched on Amazon prime just before match-of-the-day when Man U let 7 past them at Anfield - that just seemed mundane, and I never batted an eyelid.

In the end it was fun apart from the occasional paper inflicted self harm which I shut my eyes for.

22 May 2023,Not what I was expecting,"Not what I expected at all, doesn't know whether it's an action movie, sci-fi or some kind of weird hippy thing. Quite confusing at first, some things are just too stupid to believe anyone would seriously include them in a script that they'd even let other people read.

After forcing myself to continue watching it turns out it's a petty good action movie, an amazing well thought out piece of sci-fi and one of the best pieces of hippy weirdness I've ever watched.

The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that although I'm sure I'll watch it again soon I'll never be able to watch it for the first time again!

Loved it!!

20 May 2022,Every Genre All At Once,"This film is quite literally every single genre in cinema blended into one. It's a Kung Fu sci-fi action comedy drama mind bending craziness of a movie that just keeps getting more and more insane as it goes on. But it's absolutely incredible and quite possibly the most unique piece of cinema that's ever been created.

15 February 2023,Boring and pretentious.,"This movie was a boring attempt at depicting cosmicism and nihilism. The movie wants to be funny, colorful, hopeless, diverse, quirky and all at the same time. Fails to do anything right.

Not sure what the target audience for this movie is but, certainly movie goers have a very low bar to what's good these days. This feels like a cheap at attempt to make a Marvel movie without any of the super heroes but, has the same level of ""Hey, we need to save the world and find a reason to keep fighting for and go on with life, no matter the cost!""

All this moral ambiguity to save a family business laundromat at the end. Hard skip!

Everything about this film is fantastic; the concepts, execution, artistic department, directing, editing, effects, acting, sets, costumes, writing, EVERYTHHHIIIIIIIIINGGGGG...

p.s. Don't rate and review movies without finishing them first (should be common sense) and don't hate watch because the movie you were rooting for didn't get the outcome you wanted (no hate intended, just bugged me seeing some peoples' approach here) Stay open-minded and unbiased folks.

This is a movie i will never forget. I am Asian and related to this on so many levels... the intergenerational trauma, the motherly things Michelle Yeoh does, the language, the fighting, the everything!

Literally after the movie, I chatted about it with my partner and we both cried because it brought out in us something deep and difficult to talk about.. and that was how much our parent's traumatised us and led us to feel like worthless pieces of sh**s.

In a landscape of superhero movies, remakes and sequels, this movie was like a breath of fresh air.

19 May 2022,One of the few films that I watched for the first time and rated it A Must-See tier.,"This year, I might find movie of the year sooner than usual. This kind of taste is my personal favorite. A complex plot that encapsulates a simple story. Stunning visuals, profound music, and a unique storytelling technique. It's like watching Inception or Eternal Sunshine for the first time, it's very unique.

This story's narrative and character development are appeal to me. I was smiling, thrilled, and weeping all along the movies. The film uses the endless possibilities of the multiverse to teach the protagonists to understand, appreciate and accept who they are, what they have and those around them. The exterior shell of the movie may be weird, but the interior flesh is kind and human

The production was exactly as bizarre as everything else. The film has a budget of around 1/8 of the Multiverse of Madness. And they managed to make their multiverse as madness as Marvel's. So, if you've been considering whether or not to see this film, now is the time to do so. Perhaps you will discover one of the best films of your life like I did.",10
10 April 2022,I didn't not expect this movie to almost make me cry.,"The makers of Swiss Army Man are at it again. I never expected this movie to trigger an emotional response. It's rare that a film does. This movie is so wild and unpredictable, and unique. The last half hour of this movie was outrageous and beautiful and left me feeling at peace with my own struggles. The acting is incredible, Ke Huy Quan almost made me cry with his ending speech. I expected to laugh, which I did, but I never expected to be emotionally impacted the way that I was. This film is so left field in the best way possible, I think everyone should see it.

13 March 2023,Terrible,"This movis is so bad I turned it off. I love movies and like to consider myself a movie buff. I don't know how this movie came to win the best picture of the year nomination, but it begs me to ask the question, was the members of the academy high? It made no sense and told no story. No background on any of the characters that is normally there to make you care. I'm still wondering what the point of the whole movie even was. I love Michelle Yeoh. I was hoping when this movie won the best picture nomination that I would finally have a non-cookie cutter, non-self congratulating, non-political lecturing movie. Just entertainment Hollywood. That's all we moviegoers ask, to be entertained. This definitely was not it. It got Two stars for Ms. Yeoh.

In a world that feels dominated by algorithms and low-effort money grabs, this film feels like a massive stop sign planted miles deep in front of the film industry -- a clear paradigm shift in what is possible when you care about art. It exudes effort. It is meticulous in its story telling and cinematography. It plucks the best parts of action, comedy, sci-fi, and drama, then it presents them to you in a stunning bouquet. This movie loves you and it wants you to love it back. Amazing.

13 April 2022,A dizzying whirlwind ride with a lot of heart,"There's no better way to describe this film than the title itself, so I won't even try. It's a refreshing escape from the boring, mundane problems of life that just so happens to also be about the boring, mundane problems of life while somehow never becoming boring itself. Quite the opposite, this movie is a powerhouse freight train experience unlike anything I've ever seen or probably will ever see. And I've seen A LOT of movies. Imaginative, funny, moving, profound... while also frantic and almost seizure-inducing. It deserves every award it will probably win and I don't often say that about the big award contenders. The story is original, the characters feel like real people, the performances are incredibly moving and funny, and the direction is otherworldly...

I have so much more I want to say about this film because it absolutely floored me, but it also left me discombobulated and I can't put all of my thoughts into comprehensible sentences, so I'll sum it all up with this: It's a heartfelt film about what beautiful messes human beings are... and how that's okay if we're okay with it.",10
18 December 2022,After the Hype-Just as Good as Everyone's Saying,"After hearing the immense amount of hype for this film since March, I wasn't sure if it would be as good as many people were saying. Now, the hype has died down, and I finally got the chance to watch it.

And from what I've say, it absolutely lived up to the hype. My only few problems were that it became a bit too wacky at points, and I thought the misunderstanding between Evelyn and Waymond about the divorce papers were a bit contrived. But besides that, this film is an absolute spectacle.

The Daniels did a phenomenal job directing the film. So many scenes and shots throughout the film are shot with attention to detail, with so much personality throughout it. The editing is the best I've seen this year. The visual effects are great, especially for a $25m budget. It also manages to utilize a minimum number of sets, and still manage to utilize those sets to their potential.

The movie is also immensely clever, both intellectually and emotionally. The writing for the multiverse was very well done, introducing many concepts and ideas, such as the verse-jumping, flawlessly. And I adore the many messages of the movie. My interpretation of the theme was how even if life does seem worthless, and doesn't make any sense, the one thing that we can find sense in is the people close to us, and embracing each other.

Overall, my few gripes with the film hold it back from a perfect 10, but it is an amazing film, with fantastic directing from the Daniels, a profound message, and while I didn't mention it, Michelle Yeoh, Key Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all able to deliver subtle nuances in their performances, and I feel like all of them at least deserves a nomination.",9

25 March 2023,The best I've ever seen,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

12 March 2023,I don't get it and I can't see how anyone does ...,"After the first hour of non-sensible plotless mahyem, countless fist, feet and bodies flying for no reason- I stopped the stream / because I felt those on the couch were begging for an end to the torture. I really did feel I was inflicting pain on room. After reading reviews I am confident - this pathetic waste of time falls squarely into the ""Emporers New Clothes"" category / filled with random references and reminiscent of either a child's nightmare or an acid trip. Those who find meaning - fall into one of two categories - 1) completely lying and fearful of being called out for not understanding the film - or 2) more willing than I am to search for a hidden meaning. To me -it wasn't worth the effort - by far. Perhaps this is a test - an experiment / to show just how we can be convinced of anything despite our gut response. The Oscars are tonight. I imagine seeing the director and writer while giving the best picture speech / confess to the world while holding back hysterical laughter /. ""You people - are all idiots"". Mel Brooks and the cast of ""The Producers"" then storming the stage.

17 May 2022,Amazing!!,"I didn't know much about this movie going in, but I've now seen it three times and intend to watch it over and over again. Probably one of the best movies I've ever seen! It had me intrigued, laughing, and even crying. I recommend everyone should watch it at least once.

30 October 2022,Absolutely worth the hype!,"Profound, heartfelt, surreal, absurd, and hilarious. Acting is top-notch. Absolutely worth the hype.

A beautiful look at relationships between people: the complexity of mother/daughter relationships, the wonderful love story between Evelyn and Waymond, the fraught father/daughter relationship Evelyn has with her own father. Waymond (in his many forms) was a standout character in a film full of standout characters - he's an important re-definition of both Asian male masculinity and what a good life partner really looks like.

EEAAO captures the immigrant experience perfectly (there were multiple times where I felt ""yep, that's exactly it!"" while falling off my chair laughing), interweaving universal themes of regret, nihilism and love (both familial and romantic). Its central thesis is that 'life' is less about the destination than it is about the journey and the relationships we build on that journey - a point the film underscores in its constantly self-reflexive arcs.

Standout scene: Waymond with the bum bag and the chapstick. I can't say more, it'll ruin the scene.

Every actor is phenomenal - Ke Huy Quan as Waymond zips through different Waymonds without a hitch, carrying the heart and the strength of the character in every iteration of Waymond. I read that Quan went into production as he struggled to find acting roles for Asian men in US cinema - given his performance in EEAAO, it's truly our loss that we've missed his talent on our screens for a few decades. Michelle Yeoh, of course, carries the weight of Evelyn's story with sincerity, ease and gravitas, while also being incredibly funny (""very busy today!"" will never not be hilarious). And Stephanie Hsu as Joy really makes you want to cheer her on: balanced against the depths of her despair is a chaotic exuberance and a wild hope that really builds depth of character.

I enjoyed the casual queer relationship and how it both mattered (eg. In terms of Joy coming out to her grandfather, in Joy and Evelyn's interactions) and didn't matter (Joy and Becky's relationship is one of the few solid and unchanging parts of the story). Yeoh and Hsu, as Evelyn and Joy, completely sell their complicated love for each other - alongside the powerful medium of classic Asian mother nagging, of course.

This film, its actors, filmmakers/directors, and VFX artists deserve an Oscar nomination - both for the importance of the story they're telling, and the powerful and entertaining way in which they've pulled this off. Can't recommend this more.",10
17 October 2022,"Is this movie great? Yes, at least in our universe!","""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is a fantastic movie, with a lot of strengths and without major issues. It's difficult to talk about the main plot without spoiler and avoiding to make a disservice to the film, and so I will not try do that. What I can say is that ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is very entertaining, has good jokes, some clever and inspired action scenes and other crazy ideas that are not out of place. But that's not only that. I found out some days before going to the theatre that the directors are the ones that made ""Swiss Army Man"", a great movie that was able to explore the sense of life in a very original way. At that point I didn't expect to find profound themes in ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"", but I was open to the possibility. And it was the case. Indeed the multiverse is used also to have the possibility to talk about love, family, life, choices and so on. Some moments were truly impactful and moving. In order to get this final product the direction was fantastic, but the performances by the main cast were excellent. In conclusion, though it is a particular movie, I suggest it to everyone because I think it can be highly appreciated.",9
18 May 2022,Looking for something different?,"Have you ever felt like you don't understand what the hell is going on, but at the same time understand everything instinctively? That is HOW good this movie is at portraying the most insane of ideas! If you haven't watched this, you're missing out on a piece of cinematic history, and that isn't some exaggeration. Happy watching!

22 May 2022,Nothing but GOLD,"Everything Everywhere All at Once! The name of the movie is actually the most exact spoiler to itself. Haven't seen anything like this for decades. Shallow but deep, hilarious but touching, cheap but worthless!!!!!!!! Really requires some heart n sense to appreciate this gem.

Haters always hate, period.

9 August 2023,"Liked the idea, hated the movie","Given what I tend to like in life and in art, there are some movies I shouldn't enjoy but yet do. Similarly, sometimes I watch a movie that I should like, but I hate it. EEAAO is this movie.

I am still confused how I can dislike so much a grandiose movie about nihilism, with good actors, superb choreography, impressing visual effects. Worse, I paid 6 entry tickets to thank my friends for helping me move away from my flat, so I had a strong vested interest to like the movie and stay till the end despite my urge to end the boredom ordeal and leave the cinema.

So why didn't I like it, despite most people acknowledging it as a masterpiece? Characters are irritating buffoons. Dialogues are just plain bad. The plot makes no sense (introducing multiverses always induces paradoxes and plot holes, but the movie doesn't care about them). And the worst thing about the movie is the incoherent structure and the pace. (If you start any movie at a random time you'll usually quickly understand at what point of the movie you're at, for EEAAO you will not.)

The difficult part for me is that I see where the directors are coming from in making a movie about optimistic vs pessimistic nihilism, (Because yes, that's what the movie is about; I think it's important to put it here as most people whom I talk to usually struggle to put into words what it's about and what's so great about it.) and using a long useless intro about science-fiction, fast-paced action and dialogues, an avalanche of succeeding themes, to overwhelm the viewer's brain and make it more receptive to the last third of the movie with the ultimate conflict and resolution.

However, I feel like this isn't the right way to make a nihilistic movie. The path to nihilism comes from disillusionment with other philosophies. As a nihilist, I prefer movies which portray more romantic themes and ideas, and let the viewer critically decide whether the world really makes sense in the end or not.",1
28 April 2022,Generational trauma hits different in film and tv lately huh,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

3 June 2022,its way better than the trailer,"If i have to be honest i didn't expect much of the movie and because its 2 hours long i didn't want to watch it but considering it is a 2hours long movie almost every minute of it something cool and mind-bending is happening - as i said based on the name or trailer you can't judge the movie - if you like mystery and sci-fi watch the movie.

26 March 2023,"A multifaceted ""cerebral"" fun film that sucked me in and would not let me go!","Physics, philosophy, sciences (of all sorts), history, and one's imagination are brought together to illustrate the neuroses of the main characters attempting to understand and accept the experiences of modern life: Mainly, work, family, love and marriage. The presentation is very compelling, in my opinion.

The film sets up a family story of small life events converging all at one time for a family. When things turn stressful for all, each character reacts differently to their overwhelming situations with their own ""fight or flight"" instincts. These ""fight or flight"" scenes reflect so much of one's inner thoughts, feelings, and emotional frustration, that,the scenes often left me in awe. . At one point (late) in the movie, I thought the movie might never end. Still, I could not bear to turn my attention away. The ending left a lump in my throat, and a tear in the eye.

28 May 2022,An Amazing Achievement!,"The Daniels have already showed their promise with Swiss Army Man years ago thanks to their fearless, weird story telling along with tackling such themes like nihilism, alienation or making peace with oneself but with Everything Everywhere All At Once they took this to a whole another level.

Not just funny or weird but it's also so emotional and heartwarming at times while pushing the boundaries of creativity.

I could write tons of paragraphs praising the cinematography, choreography or acting and directing in this movie but one filmmaking aspect that took my utmost curiosity was the screenplay.

I can't wait to get my hands on one copy as I think it is such a great tool for aspiring screenwriters to examine with its multiple transitions, various dialogues and etc.

I can't congratulate the Daniels, cast and the crew enough with this one. Amazing!",9
15 March 2023,Oscar must be so ashamed to sit on these mantels.,"Apparently now the joy of psychosis will be jammed down our throats.

From the opening scene, the viewer is vomited upon with visual and verbal insanity and chaos, and it descends rapidly from there adding non-stop violence with bizarre spin demonstrating that they think violence is humorous.

This is what they consider the pinnacle achievement in film???

Inexplicably snubbing epic film achievements like Top Gun and Avatar, this is how much Hollywood has degraded.

It also shows how deranged the Academy Awards' voters are and begs the question, how do they get rid of them?

We viewers just keep falling for it.... thinking maybe, just maybe, this year will be different. Maybe that's our psychosis.",1
2 May 2022,A creative film BUT not worth the hype,"Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is a very deep film that touches your heart. It keeps the audience hooked from beginning to end. However, many will argue with me and disagree but I really don't get the hype over it. I see the film as a very normal film with a typical story, nothing special or new at all. The film has great humor, not going to lie when I say that I was laughing the whole time. A great sense of humor in a great time and in a good decent amount. Not too much but too little at this time, there is a great balance. There weren't any great shots, a film like that can easily be visually stunning as the director had a huge chance to allow some great shots but nothing was there. In addition, the runtime might seem a little bit too long, especially towards the end. I started to struggle during the last act because my attention span was expired.

The film has a great plot and the writing is so well done and balanced very well. The script is solid and put together in a way that is hilarious due to the creative ideas the film had in which the things that were included won't come up to any writer's mind. The film discusses the idea of the multiverse in a way that will never be discussed in any other film or tv show which is why it's a unique film. Audience members get to witness a long, funny, and great journey with the characters as they will stay hooked and will want more due to how amazing the story is.

A great acting performance from Michelle Yeoh as she plays the struggling mother. She was able to show that struggle in her body language, voice tone, and facial expressions. As well as Ke Huy Quan with his transition from one character to another (I'm not going to dive much into the two different characters that he plays to avoid spoilers). But, his shift from one character to another reminded me of Oscar Isaac's great performance whenever he shifts from Marc Spector to Steven Grant in MoonKnight (2022 - ).

In conclusion, I was, unfortunately, a little bit disappointed as I saw the high ratings. But, when I watched the film, I kept waiting and waiting for something special to happen but I realized there was nothing. The film didn't touch me at all and I didn't feel empathy toward the characters or the story. I wasn't feeling the way that the writers wanted me to feel and the same way that else felt while watching it.

Perhaps this film needs a second watch (at least for me). It needs to be given another chance as some might get lost in terms of keeping on track with the story or the concept of the film as it explains some heavy stuff in a way that might feel like a fast pace for some.

My rating is 8/10 Watched in the theatre.",9
14 June 2022,DON'T EVER BELIEVE THE OTHER SHALLOW MINDED REVIEW THAT GAVE 5 BELOWS,"Other reviews are pretty stupid and aren't helpful at all.

They pretend to be know it all types of people but in real life they aren't and just pathetic who can't just simply enjoy such beautifully made masterpiece. That's all and Thank you.

I am so glad to see such a good movie finally!

Chinese film style is not my favorite, but in this case this is the best I ever seen! Well done:')

Only back side is the Hollywood action scenes, but luckily well balanced with good dramaturg, interesting story and good acting.

I wish to see more from the Daniels.

What a rollercoaster ride through the full specter of emotions, stunning visuals, awesome characters and refreshing dialogue.

Should be seen without too much prejudice, but bugle up to be mind blown, followed by days trying to rationalize all the intelligent nuances and creative details compressed into this very masterpiece.

Some scenes might initially rub off as too grotesque, but when your mind catches up, you will realize the symbolism and they suddenly make sense and importance.

Defiantly the best movie for a long time.

6 November 2022,Refreshingly insanely different and new,"It's films like this that keeps my faith in the movie industry. This film won't be for everyone. May be too much going on and too many sudden changes but it's a journey and an ultimate journey with an amazing cast of actors. An element of over the topness to the average eye but deeply satisfying and invigorating to the seasoned movie connoisseur. It's a non stop mind tickler that keeps you gripped to the screen.

I wonder if Michelle and James had chats about the early Carpenter days...

Movies like this should be on the Oscar list along with All quiet on the western front and Licorice pizza. Easily the best flicks this year.

29 January 2023,Huge Disappointment,"If you enjoy classic Hollywood movies, you can skip this one. This movie appeared promising in the beginning but quickly devolved into a jumbo mess. The events were difficult to follow, the subtitles were way to small/moved to fast and the flipping back and forth between Chinese and English was very distracting. Apparently, this is a ""message"" movie, very poorly done. What this says about the current state of affairs in the movie industry and the over-hyped Oscars.......is depressing. Only a tech head who likes cool special effects will be fascinated by the overly long and tedious Kung Fu movie. Somewhere in there, a message is buried. I will be horrified if this film receives the Oscar for best picture. Compared to All Quiet on The Western Front, another best picture nominee, it is a big, annoying and tedious goose egg (with the exception Jaime Lee Curtis, who performance is hysterically funny.)

11 September 2022,"Everything, everywhere, all at once","I can't really explain what I just watched. It started like Matrix on steroids. Goes on to what Dr Stange and the multiverse could have been. And ends up as a heartfelt movie. 3 movies in one, that don't always make sense, it took me a bit to get into the story because I didn't understand it. And then, it clicked. And all the beginning that was a bit blurry became clear. This is a good movie, what I want to see in the cinema, something with a diverse family, people actually speaking other languages because they come from other countries. Different cultures. All mixed within a terribly clever story, with great visuals. I loved it, and will probably watch it again, now that I have the key that was missing.

It's a rollercoaster of action, comedy, drama, bonkers madness, adventure, sci-fi, introspect, discovery and human nature all rolled into a stunning display of cinematography with very strong performances from everyone.

All cast members were superb and Michelle Yeoh delivered the performance of her career.

I honestly cannot fault this film.

25 May 2022,Great movie,"Everything Everywhere All At Once, 2022, 139 minutes. Script and direction by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. The cast includes Michelle Yeoh (Evelyn), Stephanie Hsu (Joy), Ke Huy Quan (Waymond), James Hong (Gong Gong), Jamie Lee Curtis (Deirdre) and Tallie Medel (Becky).

The hype surrounding this film has been huge, with many social media posts about it. I didn't want to see the trailer, reviews, or even read its synopsis. I went to check it out knowing nothing about Everything, Everywhere All At Once. By the end of the projection, I was impressed. It's a great movie.

Anyone who knows me knows how much it costs to rate a movie a 10. Everything, Everywhere All At Once was the eighth film that deserved a 10 for me out of the nearly 3,000 films I've seen throughout my life.

The film is perfect in every way. Original script, although with the feeling that I had already seen a lot of the things that were in it. It also could, because the writers-directors mixed several genres in the same film. There's adventure, there's kung fu, there's science fiction, there's comedy, there's drama, there's suspense, there's blood, there's beating, there's melodrama, there's everything. And this mix works really well. Everything connects.

The cast is fantastic, with an emphasis on Michelle Yeoh, who should appear on the best actress candidate lists at the awards for the 2022 films. Jamie Lee Curtis is a luxury supporting actress, which works very well to increase Yeoh's brightness in the scenes where the two are together.

Costumes, makeup, hair, production design, soundtrack, everything connects to form a uniform whole. Even the exaggerations in Joy's costumes have a reason for being within the script and don't bother.

The script still plays with this year's recurring theme in blockbuster movies: the multiverse. The story takes place in several parallel universes, where Evelyn assumes different identities, such as a chef, a singer or a laundry owner.

I also highlight the insertion of inclusion and diversity in history. There are Chinese immigrants who are small businessmen in the United States, there are LGBTQIA+ characters, there are elderly people, there is female empowerment, it touches on the importance of maintaining cultural traditions of a people (there is a Chinese New Year party).

The directors show that they understand a lot about cinema and that they are passionate cinephiles, as I identified several references to successful films, such as Kar-Wai's In The Mood for Love, Tarantino's Kill Bill, current Marvel movies, Brad Bird's Ratatouille, Hong Kong kung fu B-movies, Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, Forbidden Desire (film with three stories about lesbian couples), horror B-movies, slapstick comedy, John Carpenter's Halloween ( just having Jamie Lee Curtis is already a reference to this horror classic), among others.

And the ending reminded me the ending of another film that scores 10 in my evaluation, Blue Velvet, by David Lynch, with a happy ending that can be interpreted as an irony by the directors.

It's a movie to watch and review again and again as there are so many layers and nuances to discover.",10
10 July 2022,Best Film of the Year,"Quirky, fun, innovative, and emotionally powerful. This is a ride through the farcical that is firmly grounded in the push-pull of the parent/child relationship. You'll laugh out loud, feel part of the club when you pick up on throwbacks, and sob when it finally hits you that this is your own relationship with your child or parent.

18 June 2022,Squandered opportunities.,"First of all, this movie is way over-rated at 8.x. No way, not in this verse. It is an interesting concept, but the execution is totally botched. The plot lacks any semblance of nuance or insights, instead it relies on cheap gimmicks with nonsensical kung-fu sequences and silly conversations between two rocks. The acting talent was largely wasted due to poor, amateurish script and dialogues.

3 January 2023,AN INDIE BLOCKBUSTER,"This film intrigued me as soon as the trailer for it came out in December 2021. I was curious how they were going to handle their own multiverse concept. And the fact that the film was actually produced by MCU's Russo Brothers made me even more curious. And now having watched the film, I can understand why this film was produced by them.

For an A24 produced film, this film actually feels more like a blockbuster film rather than an indie film. The plot was fast-paced, the action choreography shames even most of the other recent summer blockbuster films, and the vfx were well done. Hard to actually believe that the budget spent was only in the region of $14 million. But I guess it makes sense when you look at the small number of cast, which was integrated nicely into the story. And also why it's currently A24's highest grossing film ever.

They didn't even waste any time in moving the plotline. For a film this long, it's actually refreshing (in a way) that a film uses all its allocated time without lingering too much on anything. The film's plot is also quite easy to follow, even though the concept is supposed to be complicated. I was not confused once while I watched the film.

I love all the homages they managed to place in the film. From the action choreography scenes (which was surely inspired by Jackie Chan's films and old kung-fu films, probably even Michelle Yeoh's own Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) to romantic scenes that is obviously a nod to Wong Kar Wai's films like In the Mood for Love, for instance. It is definitely a love letter to the Hong Kong film industry.

I guess if there's a weakness in the film, is that for a film with a multiverse concept, it's actually quite simple and shallow. I mean, I'm not saying it is shallow. But it isn't as complicated as, say, Predestination. The message is powerful, sure. But it's the usual feel good message you see in almost every film. It kind of makes the film feel a bit lame.

But that doesn't take away the fact that this film is a good film. In fact, this is a great film. It's a joy to watch from start to finish. And it will make you experience a ton of emotions throughout the film, albeit a little brief. This film has a pretty high mass appeal. It is the most accessible for anyone who hasn't seen an A24 film. A jumping pad, if you will *wink wink (if you excuse my pun).",9
2 September 2022,"In a world full of reboots and sequels, be EEAAO","Usually if I watch a film that is so obviously divisive, I'll expect the mix of reviews but I must admit the reviews here baffle me. I'd love to ask the people rating this film 1-3. What did they see? Because it wasn't this film.

It feels so rare to see a film that is it's own thing. Even when paying homage to films you've seen, this film feels completely new. A few reviews try to argue it's ripping off The Matrix, or The One or a film with a multiverse... it's none of those things. It reminds me of Bo Burnham's Inside in a strange way - it felt completely new, and like I can't believe someone hasn't done it before, but also can't imagine how one would even begin to create something like this.

I don't understand many of the criticisms, like the plot being all over the place. The plot is really straightforward and clear - I guess some people zoned out.

One review even criticises Stephanie Hsu's performance which is baffling - she was exceptional.

Some called it toilet humour or crass - I was actually thinking how funny it was to have the occasional sex toy into a fighting scene without it being vile.

Maybe it's an age thing. I think I would have enjoyed this film for its creativity and originality in my 20s, but I'm not sure it would have had the same impact that it's had on me now, as I speed past middle age. This film taps into something that so many people can relate to especially as you get older - what if all the decisions you've ever made have led you to the worst possible version of your life? What if you've fallen into the trap of passing down your own damaged relationship with your parents to your child? Does anything actually matter, really?

This film asks you to consider all of this and yet it seems some viewers did not - they just checked their watch and waited for the next funny action scene. So much that's glossed over or criticised is a huge part of the point.

I'm so tired of unoriginal content. I'll take this over another superhero movie or requel any day. It's not perfect - I think it could have been a little shorter, some scenes could have been trimmed down. But seeing what filmmakers can achieve with limited budget, their imagination and some YouTube VFX tutorials is truly staggering. This film says yes, you could make a live action Lion King or yet another Batman movie - but what if you made something new? Even if the film weren't great, that alone would have me praising it. Fortunately the film is great, and if you want something that's both action-packed and introspective, this will serve you well.",9
23 May 2022,The Multiverse of Madness we deserved!,"Perhaps no film has electrified audiences and charged up movie groups all over social media in recent times than ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"", an phenomenally deranged sci-fi epic that catapults a heartwarming family story to cult status thanks to its cutting edge visual imagery and unexpected narrative quirks. The moment you think you know where the movie is headed is exactly when the makers will pull the rug out from under you, creating so much hysteria and mayhem that you are rendered as confused as the protagonists on screen.

We follow superstar Michelle Yeoh, who seems to be a bored laundromat owner called up by the IRS for a tax audit, only to have her world turned upside down when she encounters a mysterious, multiversal version of her husband who asks her to join him on a journey down a rabbit hole of epic proportions. Tasked with taking down a seemingly megalomaniacal villain named ""Jobu Tapaki"", Yeoh's character traverses the many universes using a technique called verse-jumping, rendered immensely believable and enjoyable by the cutting-edge CGI and visual effects employed by the makers.

The immensely relatable Ke Huy Quan is terrific as Yeoh's ever suffering husband while Stephanie Hsu is a revelation as her troubled daughter, who constantly disappoints her mother despite her best efforts. Yeoh's world renowned martial arts skills and prowess as a decorated character actress are harnessed with equal aplomb by directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert to tell a core story of the lengths a mother will go for her daughter, albeit with multiversal consequences at stake.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is an absolutely mental sci-fi adventure that blends comedy, fantasy and heart to serve up an immensely entertaining mashup that achieves the multiversal aspirations which ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" set out to accomplish and failed. Michelle Yeoh makes a triumphant return to a mainstream role, with a performance for the ages. Highly, highly recommended!",9
4 August 2022,"In another life, I would have loved doing laundry and taxes with you""","A profoundly touching take on nihilism, a roller coaster of emotions that films rarely scratch the surface of. In the end, it's all worth it.

The only reason I did not give it 10/10 is I did think the sentimental bits were a bit drawn out, but it's flawless in every single other way. Absolutely incredible.

It will make you feel everything everywhere all at once.

4 April 2023,Waste my time to confusing,"I watched this to the end and thought it was terrible. But I kept hoping it would get better. No explanations of how the lady kept switching dimensions. It seemed to have very little plot. I just could not get to grips with this. I will not be giving it a second view. The lead actress played her part very well. (Enough to get as Oscar) the constant jumping from one dimension or time to another was just too much for me. I have to admit the film looked good and the special effects where good too, but that is no excuse for a poor and confusing plot. I thought with all the praise it would be brilliant but it was not to my liking.

12 September 2022,Marmite.,"You will either love this film or you will hate it.

I've never watched a more polarising film before, both my girlfriend and my friend were unable to watch this film, whilst I laughed, cried and loved this movie.

You need to get through the 1st chapter to unlock the true joy of this film. And I recommend doing some back reading of the other ways to see this film when youre finished.

All I can say is you need to try this film, and you need to hold on as long as you can.

I though top gun was sweeping a way to be my favourite film of this year, but this film has surprised me in the best way possible.

You might not love this film. But give it a try, and if you don't hate it, you'll be unable to do anything but think about it.",10
5 March 2023,I saw this somewhere else,"EEAaO is an enjoyable romp somewhat in the vain of Time Bandits and Hitch Hikers Guide wrapped into a Bruce Lee (so not entirely original - but then, what is in an EEAaO mindset) and, as The Guardian wrote, the film has ""spunk, quirky anime-inspired visual panache and absurdist humour."" A line in the film is ""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on."" And that seems an appropriate opinion to hold until watching to the end of the film. There are films to see many times, but for me this one is worth to see once, and just enjoy that experience. One never ones when one sees things again, so make good of the moment.

But the way it pulls you in gradually, hiding powerful themes that we all can agree on behind it's comedic and action oriented presentation is what elevates this movie to greatness. Come for the action and comedy and leave with thoughtful consideration.

The randomness of all of this has taken the monty python to another level. If you feed a successful ai all of the british comedy tradions of absurdity and the great martial arts movies of the far east together. You will get a bad version of this movie because it won't be directed and written by these brilliant directors and scriptors. Thank you, you have brought 2 hours of straight excitement, fun and energy to my life.

25 May 2022,A First,"So, this has to be the first A24 movie I have not fallen asleep to and actually enjoyed. I have noticed that the A24 movies are more for the younger generation. I love action and adventure, this movie was amazing! It was like art in a movie. Every move, every motion, precisely calculated. Not only was the story a grabber, the acting was incredible! This was not your typical movie and for that alone I cannot wait to see what this director will do next! I highly recommend, but not for children's eyes, there are a few adult things in this movie. Such as dildos and a few bad words. More for grown up teens. I will definitely be watching this one again, just to count how many times Joy changed clothes lol.

7 January 2023,Perfectly imperfect,"I get why some may find this isn't for them. However, to me this film works on several levels for different audiences. It can be deep if you want it to be or a movie that has people with hot dog hands. I enjoyed it tremendously even with its quirks and even agreeing that there are things this film does completely wrong. I think this adds to the statement it is trying to make. Appreciate it as it is not as you would want it to be. Yes it's a mess and that's the point.

The cast is outstanding. Quan and Yeoh work well together and show range. Stephanie Hsu holds her own and steals many of the scenes.

30 April 2023,"Lives up to it's title, and the best Oscar winner I've seen!","Take some alternate universe sci fi, throw in a touch of romance, add 2 heaped tablespoons of bawdy humour, a sprinkle of touching moments, a light crumble of family drama, and stir together with 2.75 tonnes of surreal comedy, and you've just about got the recipe for this movie.

Moved along at a breakneck pace like a Jackie Chan movie, and after watching it I kept imagining people with hot dog fingers, which shows how much it got under my skin :-D

And all that complex madness for a very simple message at the end, which we can all relate to. Pure brilliance!

Certainly blows that dour, severed-finger remake of Father Ted out of the water for watchability. Do yourself a favour, bin that movie and watch this instead, you'll enjoy it far more.",10
12 September 2022,Don't watch this casually.,"I loved this, but don't watch this while you're trying to do something else. At least not unless you are a) VERY good at split attention and b) speak Chinese fluently.

The show bounces back and forth between English, Chinese, and heavily accented Chinese. This is not a criticism, this is just the result of the setting of the movie, and that's fine. But if you are trying to watch it while looking down at something you are working on you will miss important elements, and that would be a shame.

The acting all round was superb, serious where it had to be, exasperated, incredulous, sympathetic, angry. Just about every actor here put in an above average or incredible performance. Some bits were, well weird as hell, but that was really just to make a point. And even those weird bits were often of high emotional impact.

The directing choices were on point, the pacing was neither to fast or to slow, and the character development was well done without making anyone a caricature of themselves. A much better approach to cross-reality shenanigans than other movies that came out at about the same time.

It's good to see some older actors seriously kicking arse on screen. And not being afraid to be vulnerable at the same time.",8

I think to enjoy this movie you need to let go of your individual world view to really let it take your mind on the ride. Take your mind out of its box for a bit and launch on the adventure of a lifetime. This is a movie I will want to watch many times over and I have already told everyone in my life that they *must* watch it.

27 May 2022,Acid Trip Experience with a Great Message,"One of the best movies I have ever watched. It was insane and awkwardly entertaining. I have never seen such a beautiful mother and daughter relationship story. The movie really loves family values. It also was aware of everyone's mental health.

The daughter felt ashamed of who she was and was scared of what her family would think of her. Since she has a girlfriend. Thus creating a villain origin in her point of view.

The mom is stressing due to responsibility of being a mom, managing her laundry business and of course doing her taxes.

The father is always kind and warm-hearted. He is also persuasive and cares a lot. Thus saving the mom from headaches from the tax person.

Yes we fight, we mess up, we feel guilty and ashamed but in all this chaos, we can still love and be kind to each other no matter what happens or how ugly we can be.

Despite our differences in how we see things, this movie has shown its compassion throughout the chaos in the multiverse. Great movie!",9
4 May 2022,Why are the ratings so high?,"I'm a queer child of asian immigrants myself and went to the cinema with high expectations, since so many people on the internet were hyping this movie up. I didn't even watch a trailer or read a film description which was a huge mistake. I didn't expect stereoptypical (kung fu) fighting scenes and hollywood humor √† la Deadpool or Ted.... There were some emotional scenes with strong dialogue which then got destroyed by unnecessary, unfunny, overwhelming fighting scenes... (uhm the bagel black hole?????) One of the most underwhelming and disappointing movies I've ever watched at the cinema.

3 May 2022,The True Multiverse of Madness!,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

4 April 2023,"Bursting with originality, imagination and absurdism","Everything Everywhere All At Once is a movie you'll have to see to believe. There are so many original and weird concepts that'll blow your mind. There are moments that are genuinely beautiful, emotional and hilarious. Every scene brings out something so highly imaginative and crazy that the audience wasn't anticipating. However what makes this movie so special is it's themes about family conflicts, the rebellious nature of teenagers and generational trauma, something which most of us go through. Michelle Yeoh is the star of the show delivering a beautiful performance as Evelyn that has that warmth and motherly love to it and so did Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan. The action is genuinely well choreographed and is pretty hilarious at times. And finally the direction. The Daniels directed the hell outta this movie. They lean on to every possible outlandish and absurdist ideas they could think of and never play it safe creating a visual feast.

It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me think. This is a masterpiece full of imagination, creativity, stunning visuals and beautiful character moments that I'm pretty sure will never leave my mind.",10

I cannot remember the last time I had such an incredible time watching a movie... Everything here is really fantastic, and the wrapping touches your heart. If you don't feel anything, there's a problem with you.

18 March 2023,"Totally Worth It, Admirably Done","The film is additive in numerous ways, so the derivative devices are totally fine. At the same time, I'm not sure they were even needed. This movie has lots to offer. Perhaps due to the nature of the context the movie develops-a fractured modern existence-vignettes pervade and touch upon an array of converging forces.

It's not sci-fi, in how it feels, but there's that element to allow for an exploration of what's important and what isn't, in life. And, when that's sorted out, so, too, does the chaos felt amidst all that's going on in these days. So, I guess that's why it's award winning.

The pace isn't always right and the tension is uneven, in my opinion. Is that to feel like we feel now? Maybe it's intended. Or were there some complexities to this that couldn't get ironed out in time? Or did it just take me too long to figure out the centrality of parenting, besides attitude toward the ""ups"" and ""downs"" of life?

I guess the title is permissive of there being many themes. The internet makes us feel like we know everything, and yet we feel nothing. Last summer I read Stolen Focus by Johann Hari. If you're up to reading before watching this, it'll tie in quite well! Further, get ready to mitigate intergenerational miscommunication! This movie wants to heal us.",8
20 August 2022,The better multiverse film?,"When Dr Strange Into The Multiverse came out, reviews kept popping up on YouTube saying ""Everything Everywhere All at Once is the better multiverse movie "" so we were really excited to watch it. I like the multiverse concept, love Michelle Yeoh, James Hong, & Jamie Lee Curtis, it sounded perfect.

It *was* entertaining, and quite fast paced. But it was just too weird. No it wasn't confusing, it was quite funny & quirky, but ultimately a little too bizarre for me. This had more heart than Dr Strange M. O. M. Though.

I think the best multiverse film that I've seen is Into The Spider verse.

26 June 2022,The perfect 2022 surrealism,"I was slightly annoyed or at least a bit impatient to begin with, whilst Michelle Yeoh plays a kind of frantic, slightly mad character mixing up languages and basically everything in her life, like a postmodern Duracell rabbit version of a noblewoman from a Dostoyevsky novel. But eventually you realise that what is thematically a most banal, simple plot folds out as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the century. It is one of those rare cases where a film can give you so much that a book cannot, as the surrealism eventually grows on you to become a condensed hyperrealism that nails you to the seat for an emotional rollercoaster ride of an experience. Fantastic.

I thank the other reviews who made me feel like I'm not alone thinking that this movie is so over the place, and confusing that is utterly crap. And that I'm not stupid, because i couldn't get it, or understand anything.

Thanks for the common sense, of other than the nerds.",1
25 August 2022,For me it's a 20 out of 10,"I love this movie, it almost feels like when you have a chaotic crazy dream where everything randomly happens but somehow all comes together and makes sense.

I love the acting (It's excellent really), the storyline and the humour are on point and the final message behind it is beautiful!

It's really a very clever way to storytell and the transition required to make the story believable are beautifully done!

Excellent work, 20 out of 10 from me!

16 October 2022,"Not sure what I just watched, but I liked it.","There aren't many movies that manage this level of absurdity. There are even fewer movies that manage to stay coherent throughout.

Everything Everywhere All at Once sure does manage both. It's hilarious yet touching. And so, so absurd.

There are pop culture references, but not too many of them; it most movies these terribly annoy me, but they were oddly fitting here.

The dialogues are often hilarious, making me laugh out loud.

The action is fun, the VFX are surprisingly good (even though apparently done by amateurs?), the props are... deliberately terrible, maybe?

I'd almost consider this a perfect movie, though there were a few times where the silliness was a bit much, and a few other times that felt a bit long. It's still a clear recommendation, though.

Not that I have any idea what I just watched. It's really quite weird.",9
4 April 2022,Matrix meets Sense 8,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

15 February 2023,Nothing short of amazing,"I've watched a lot of good movies over the years. I have watched a decent amount of great movies as well. I have watched very few perfect movies, and this is one of them. From the opening scene I was hooked. The characters were so beautifully written that you fall in love with them instantly, especially Waymond. It starts out by introducing us to Evelyn, Waymond, their daughter Joy, and their laundromat. They have some issues with their taxes and have to report to an IRS examiner. From the moment they arrive at the examiners office and sit at the desk the movie changes genres completely. It goes from a movie about a small business owner and taxes to a fantastic sci-fi adventure. It's a lot to take in all at once, but that's what makes it even more interesting. We are thrown straight into the adventure just like Evelyn is. Boy, what an adventure. I won't go into detail, because honestly it's too much to explain. Behind all of the amazing special effects, action sequences, and hilarious jokes, this film is a wonderful story about family and appreciating the little things. Watching this film helped me to realize how much I have to be thankful for. It impacted me enough to make me reevaluate myself and I think that makes this a perfect film.",10
26 July 2022,The title is accurate,"This is a singular, messy, fantastic, beautiful, human film. There are moments that are literally a dozen thing/feelings/thoughts/stories/histories all at once. The story is so universal and so essential with extraordinary performances by everyone in the cast.

13 March 2023,I couldn't dig it,"All these academy award nominations so I decided to check it out. For the most part, them artsy fartsy movies liked by the academy have been hit or miss for me. This one is a miss. The movie opened kinda weird from the get go but I figured being different might actually be decent. I mean, I tried to like this one because of Michelle Yeoh who I grew up watching back when she fought along Jackie Chan's side back in the day.

I found the whole thing to be a mess that kept jumping around so much idk what I was watching. About halfway through I found the movie to be such a drag I nearly turned it off. For me the problem is they've got maybe 15 good minutes into a little over 2 hrs. This movie did have one positive: it cured my insomnia and put me to sleep.

24 June 2022,A film that really captures your mind!,"I love Michelle Yeoh! Her performance in this movie versus her performance as the mother in Crazy Rich Asians proved how terrific an actor she is! I also enjoyed seeing Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), From Indiana Jones and the Temple of doom, as an adult.

In an interview I read with Jamie Lee Curtis, she mentioned how great it was not to have to suck in her gut, for a change. Her performance as well, was fantastic.

I saw this movie with a fairly large group of people and they all agreed with me, that this was a great film!

22 April 2022,This was SOOO STRANGE,"And yet so unexpectedly good?!? First of all, Michelle Yeoh is just AMAZING in this role. Her best yet i would say! Watching the trailer I really didn't think I would enjoy this movie, but i was super curious! This surprised me where rigght off the bat it starts with a big punch, fun characters and HILARIOUS INSANE moments.

Not to mention the metaphor was a nice touch!

Overall felt it was bit long for what it was, a good 20-30 mins could have been cut imo.

4 August 2022,An All Time Classic... And Cinematic Miracle,"""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is a cinematic miracle...

Its not only the best film of 2022 by far, its one of the greatest films of all time. This is the best original film IP, that I have seen or experienced, since the first Matrix film came out in 1999 ( for different reasons of course ). Now it shares a spot in my Top 5 films of all time ( right alonside The Matrix actually ).

I can't say the film is for everyone, as I've already seen some saying they ""walked out"" of the film or ""The film sucks"" or ""its overrated"" or ""Its ass"". These people are completely missing the incredible storytelling and social commentary of the film. Its a Multi generational family drama, that is placed inside of a euphoric, wild, insane, action packed, and visually stunning multiverse film.

The films deeper story and meaning, touches on real life subject matter and themes such as LGBT, Depression, the curse of comparison, family trauma/relationships, Existentialism, Nihilism, and Asian-American identity. Michelle Yeoh leads an incredible cast of people, who bring this storytelling masterpiece to life.

As someone that has been a fan/mark for Michelle Yeoh, since first watching her 1985 martial arts classic ""Yes Madam"", along eith all of her Hong Kong work in the 80s & 90s. This is the magnum opus performance of her career and that is saying alot! It would be the stunning robbery of the year, if she's not walking home with an Academy Award for Best Actress.

All in All this is all time great cinematic film, that deals with alot of real life subject matter and delivers one of the most insane and emotional trips in decades ( and for sure should win Best Picture ). An easy 5 Stars and then some...",10
28 April 2023,"Amazing and beautiful, which received an Oscar as well","Firstly the acting is so fabulous by all actors, which keeps the movie so authentic and true.

The script is beautifully written with connecting the possibilities of a sci-fia in an completely normal world. It's a first of its kind so no wonder it won the Oscar. The directing is so on point that it just makes you wonder and appreciate the characters so much.

It's a very well executed movie in terms of story, dialogue, acting, comedy, tense, drama literally everything. The BGM is decent enough as well that connects well with the viewers.

Plus thing whole concept is created by the young generation directors and writers who deserve appreciation.",8
13 April 2022,Best I seen at a cinema,"Definitely the most entertaining movie I seen so far at the cinema. It was a little confusing at the beginning but it does get much better later. Funny yet touching, definitely recommended! This movie might not be everyone's cup of tea, in my opinion, it is a 9/10, but this movie is definitely deserve more than a 1/10 ! I give it 10 to protest against the 1s (:

23 March 2023,Over-hyped!,"Don't know how it won so many Oscars, the production and PR team must've gone into overdrive to promote this total mess of a film! The storyline is a mish-mash of every thought that every deranged person might have had in the last zillion years. It's too rushed, everyone shouts all the time. However, I shouldn't really write a review of the whole film as I didn't last the whole film. I thought having Jamie Lee Curtis might help, but oh no her character just added t9 the chaos. I suppose the best performance was when Ke Huy Quan received his Academy Award, at least he tried to make sense of it all. I only watched the film because of him.

10 April 2022,Shang-Chi should hire this fight choreographer,"Everything Everywhere is a chaotic multi-genre film. It is partly a family drama (mostly mother-daughter), partly sci-fi/fantasy (jumping between multiple parallel universes), and partly an action film. Fight scene weapons include folded chairs, weighted fanny packs, and office equipment. That brings to mind Shang-Chi (of the Ten Rings), who was supposed to have been taught a variety of fighting methods, but stuck to fairly traditional weapons.

Michelle Yeoh does wonderfully as a harried immigrant woman, running a laundry business, dealing with a tax audit, having her estranged father arrive (he never approved her marriage), while being dragged unwillingly into a situation where she found a universe-jumping technique (in a different universe) and created a monster that had to be stopped. The script has the mention-then-use rule. Inadmissible deductions in the audit foresee her alternate realities. A lot of fights in various universes happen in the audit office, and what appears to be butt plugs displayed there are also used later.

The problem I have is that the whirlwind of universes left me mentally breathless.",8
15 April 2023,Why this movie gets mixed reviews,"The reason this movie is a masterpiece and won so many awards is because it pushes the boundaries of modern cinema. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have done something remarkable here but in order for you to get the wisdom, you have to surrender to the journey. You are not going to be able to make sense of this in your mind right away. But, if you try to stay in the moment and follow Evelyn through each scene and each experience as it unfolds, then you will find yourself laughing out loud at the absurdity. You will find yourself feeling regrets and remembering your own life as a series of choices and failures and could have beens. You will find yourself opening up to your own life and coming to terms with your own choices and ultimately realizing how important kindness and love really is. You will find yourself crying and wanting to hug your family. You will find yourself cherishing the moment.

The surrealism and utter wackiness is a device to help you surrender into the nothingness of everything. Because in the end, this life is a hot mess and we are all in some crazy vortex of limitless possibilities. And even though it doesn't make sense, we hold onto love. This movie IS a genuine modern day masterpiece. With a work of art this advanced it is almost certain that many people won't get it. Because true art pushes the boundaries of perception and most people are too comfortable in their box to let it in. But if you let go of what you think you know and surrender to this film, you will see what I mean, and it may change your life. Thanks for making this film. Thanks for being true artists.",10
7 August 2022,A feat of cinematography and storytelling,"Great family-centered sci-fi with cool action sequences! Should watch if you like somewhat whimsical movies with positive undertones.

Also great for angsty young people who love, but struggle with, their parents.

In ""Everything, Everywhere, All At Once"" the Daniels accomplish an achievement akin to ""Cloud Atlas"" and the works of Christopher Nolan. Their film dauntlessly travels where few have gone before tackling life's hard what-ifs through manifesting different versions of self across an infinite multiverse in this reality-bending opus.

Michelle Yeoh's dynamic acting brilliantly captures the choice to face life's many questions with turmoil and love rather than frustration at lack of answers. Alongside Ke Hay Quan and Stephanie Hsu, the trio of lead actors provide inspiration for any family member faces growing pains.",9

15 July 2022,Absurdly empyreal !!!,"Nothing matters whether I review it or not maybe its just this cinema's magic that made me do it. EEAAO takes the viewers on a philosophical genre-blending ride through the multiverse.

The fiction of multiverse is crafted astoundingly as an allegory to our mind's absurdity and ambivalence. I am pretty sure it will amaze you, shock you, confuse you, irritate you, make you cry, laugh, and love all at once.

The film's introduction to multiple realities of life is in itself mind boggling albeit uncountable questions comes along with which the film answers with different abstract emotions making it more convincing.

""Maybe the meaning of life is kindness. Maybe we should cling to each other. Maybe we should learn to let go. Maybe it's all meaningless. Or rather... maybe it's everything, everywhere, all at once.""",10

18 September 2023,"Certainly unique, eye popping to the MAX, and a love child/letter to films past, but like many I can't understand all the Oscar wins","My quick two cents about this film. I didn't love it, but I really enjoyed it, does that make any sense? It has a bit of everything in it for someone to enjoy. A ton of inspiration taken from many films (The Matrix the most notable, little bit of Mr. Nobody maybe?, The superhero genre, 2001 for sure. Too many to name) and some really cool and normally not seen often quick brief flashes of other movies thrown about. Completely unexpected but relevant to what's happening.

Very difficult to describe this. Definitely a visual movie. An offbeat, original fantasy/reality blend, and surreal mind trip that plays out through the main story of one family's domestic troubles. A well drawn-out story that uses the multiverse to great effect and doesn't mind being more than a bit weird to take great advantage of this tool. It is a very WOKE movie, so if that's not your thing here is your warning now.

It starts really slow, almost to the point where you get a little impatient but after the first fifteen minutes, time to hit the fast forward button people literally. It loses a bit of steam towards the end but it leads to a satisfying conclusion.

Here's where I'm a bit lost, the academy awards domination. Michelle Yeoh is an amazing actress, truly enjoyed all the movies I've seen her in. I couldn't be more proud for her to win an academy award for Best Actress. The rest are head scratchers, I'm mostly unfamiliar with the other nominees other than The Banshees Of Inisherin honestly. Jamie Lee Curtis? She's hardly in this. Shocking! Stephanie Hsu got robbed. Ke Huy Quan? I don't know.... the directors, maybe? Best Picture? Really?? Best Original Screenplay and Film Editing, now that I would do all day.

A great cast selection, mixing in great veterans with some relative newcomers that have a great showcase for all their talents. Good soundtrack. As original and colorful as a movie can be, funny (Waymond and Jobu Chewbacca LOL), sad, emotional, touching and very self-aware. A very fun movie, definitely not for all tastes but perhaps the one that will be the most noteworthy release of 2022. And yes, this is one of those you have to watch more than once. Its just built that way.",8
22 April 2022,"Hilarious, Terrifying, Painful, and Comforting","I do not want to go into too much as it really is worth viewing blind. I will say it gives me faith in fresh ideas and revamped concepts in new exciting ways. The amount of creativity is staggering, from the plot itself to the cinematography. It is worth seeing even if in the end you don't love it, you walk away with something to mull about in late night parking lots with friends eating leftover popcorn.

Multiverse connected with great messages at the end makes this film outstanding. I even dont want to talk about details on this film. Eveything everywhere at all once based on love , respect , emphaty. They are key factors and important emotions and the only way to change the world in all multiverses. So it doesnt matter in which multiverse you live just be kind , respect other and make an emphaty. That is what you help to create your difference and change you and people around you.

18 April 2022,How a complex concept should be portrayed,This is one of the most interesting and complex movies I have ever seen. No other films have taken the idea of the multiverse head on and displayed it with accurately. You become immersed in the idea of an ever expanding multiverse each with its own side plot. It is not only the concept that is engaging but the directing and storytelling is peak. At first I thought the cast was mid but after this film perfectly characterized each person so well I actually came to really like them. The only thing that I would've liked/ preferred is if the film didn't act as a comedy so much as some of the jokes came off as cringe or unnecessary. I can not think of any other films to compare this to this is truly one of a kind and a much watch to anyone who can comprehend complex ideas such as this. In reality the concepts portrays are way more complicated than what was shown the film does its absolute best with the format its given to expand while staying consistent tot he main plot as possible. The film seems more as a summary since each alternate universe could be its own side story but the movie does. This can easily be a film series or a TV show on its own but compacting it all into one movie while also getting your message across is near to an impossible task for most people which is why I believe this movie should be made mandatory to watch by everyone.,10
30 January 2023,Pretentious Garbage,"Simple: Just because something is overly complicated doesn't mean it is intellectual.

Overrated. Way too long. Utter Nonsense. I haven't been this upset about an overrated movie since ""Interstellar.""

What nice things can I say? The acting was good, it was nice to see Quan and Hong again. There were some funny moments but not enough to hold my interest. The cinematography was so overwhelming that I couldn't wait for the film to end.

If this junk wins Best Picture I'll be as upset as I was when ""Chicago"" beat out ""The Pianist"" in 2003. Or when ""Shakespeare in Love"" beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" in 1999.",2

20 March 2023,A Unique and Interesting Movie that's Actually Quite Necessary,"I didn't see this movie when it came out, but I remember it got the internet talking. It wasn't until it was nominated for the Oscars that I finally got to seeing it.

And honestly, I could see why the hype was there.

This is a very unique film filled with some excellent performances and really cool fight scenes. It also plays deep with certain topics like meaning, regret, nihilism, and multidimensional connection. All the while leaning in with a veneer of absurdism.

Michelle Yeoh plays Evelyn, an elderly mother struggling to keep her business afloat, her marriage together, and her daughter's sexual orientation a secret. There's a lot of tension and drama surrounding her family and the IRS agent that makes her very miserable. During her meeting, she learns that there are multiple universes that are at risk of destruction from an entity known as Jobu Topacky, and only she can save them. Evelyn learns how to tap into her alternate versions and learn different skills and lessons to survive.

I think a lot of the negative reviews so far come from people who couldn't get past the absurdism. I mean, there's an alternate dimension where everyone has hot-dog fingers. There are also dimensions where everyone's a rock. All this is meant to be silly. The metaverse is a motif for deeper lessons on finding value and meaning even when things look bleak. We all look back and wonder what our lives would be like if we made different decisions. We all wonder if we're truly living our best lives. We also wonder if we should simply accept our lives or demand something better.

Waymond is the true hero of this movie. Ke Huay Quan came out of retirement for this role and absolutely nails it. The sad, sweet husband tries so hard to bring out the best in Evelyn even when she won't listen and delivers I think the true message of the film: make the most out of the chaos. This runs in deep contrast with Jobu who simply believes that nothing truly matters. If everything is chaos, there's no point in us feeling anything.

I've often heard the term ""cheerful nihilism"" thrown out a couple of times. Rick and Morty come to my mind. So many of us have given into the cynicism being portrayed in our media. We've become ""blackpilled"" about a lot of things. So, to see a movie that tells us to make the most of our situations even if they don't seem ideal was a refreshing change of pace.

I've also learned to divorce the Academy Awards from the public consumption. Top Gun Maverick is my favorite film from 2022, but EEAAO was my pick for Best Picture at the Oscars. It's unique, filled with great performances, editing, direction, and a creative story.

I doubt people will forget this film in five years. There's too much in it for us to forget it. Compared to movies like Nomadland, The Shape of Water, and Argo, I'd say this is one of the most deserving of praise and Best Picture.

But that's my opinion.",9
28 June 2022,A fun and unique action movie with emotional underscoring,"Stunning action sequences that are much more interesting than the typical action flick are the first that sticks out, but there's more to this movie than that. Each character sees the world in a very different, often conflicting, way. This sets up emotional drama and invited the viewer to actively consider their worldview. There are also some amazing creative decisions that tie this movie together and make it a unique and incredibly enjoyable experience.

31 January 2023,"Original, stylistic and awesome.","EEAAO is one of the most original and fun films to have been released in recent years. I must admit as a huge fan of action I thought the multiverse idea blended very well with the action scenes, and of course with how the plot unfolded.

But the main focus for this film is the character development and I guess you could say ""message"" that makes it stand out amongst the crowd, and I think this was written very well as the multiverse idea was explored.

Also the fact that the production had only a handful of VFX artists is absolutely mind blowing with how the effects were done.

Overall I would highly recommend EEAAO for it's originality and style.

18 April 2022,A very wild ride but not a perfect one,"Can many brilliant moments in a movie compensate for lesser-than moments of significance? I was asking myself that question over and over as EEAaO kept astonishing me with inspired whimsy and outlandish sequences. So, what are the cinematic problems with EEAaO? First, the opening drags and drags. I know there's a goodly amount of setup / intro needed but there's actually too much setup for what's to come and the pace is glacial. This contrasts with many later moments of sublime stillness in the middle of manic action that make perfect sense for overall pacing. Second, there's a Disney-sized dollop of sentimentality and sui generis La Familia a la Chinoise that hits you over the head, particularly later on and it's 100% telegraphed. That said, the movie has jaw-dropping moments of cinematic bluster and choreography. If Michele Yeoh doesn't get an Academy nod for best actress there truly is no justice. So, if you like over-the-top movie moments and can tolerate the underlying family-centric group therapy session thrust upon you, get ready for an amazing ride.

18 December 2022,PURE CINEMA - EVERYTHING IS A WINNER,"Oh my, what a wonderful film. The performances are off the chain. Mostly though, THIS is the type of film that we used to GO TO THE MOVIES for. It is an escape, it grabs you right away and takes you through its multiverse on a joy ride AND on its terms. It is PURE CINEMA. I can see why it is getting all the praise and accolades it has already gotten, and I couldn't be happier for Michelle Yeoh, who I have been watching for decades FINALLY getting such a prime role. So fabulous watching her on this run right now. If you are really deep into this film like I was, check out the link and look at all the trivia already there. This is a complex art piece, but the trivia gives a ton of insight into the ins and outs of their world. A lot went into this film and it packs an entertaining punch. One for the ages. It really is that great.

10 July 2022,A classic from another timeline.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

5 June 2023,A Breath of Fresh Air,"Why movies are made to touch us in some way and entertain us and maybe make us feel less alone. The concept behind the film is fascinating but it's the execution that ultimately matters .There was a hundred way this could fail and maybe two that it could succeed .The Daniels and the cast and crew the assembled nailed the landing and gave us the most incredible experience. They found the heart and gave us an adventure .

Winning seven Oscars Best Actress for one of the best and most original wins for the category .Michelle Yeoh gives a performance that demands much from her and she delivers . Supporting Oscar wins along with wins in editing original screenplay and best directing and picture are much deserved. The Academy continues to expand on what is considered the finest achievements in film. But even without that this is one of the all time standouts .A mix of humor, adventure fantasy and just enough family drama. It's well worth your time.

23 October 2022,FRESH MOVIE ALERT,"A very refreshing take on concepts which we are already familiar with, the secret ingredient here is that this movie is made with LOVE. This movie spreads out passion and love the film makers have for it. The screenplay had all my attention and never slipped anywhere during the whole runtime of the movie.

Michelle Yeoh is a star. Action sequences are spot on. Great acting and story telling. Can't believe a team of 9 people pulled off the VFX work, it seemed so real and fresh. After the usual marvel and dc movies this is definitely a refreshing concept and beautifully created.

A must watch, it won't disappoint.

1 May 2022,Utter nonsense,"Unique. Kind of. If you mean unique is just purely random stupid ideas brought together and then making even more random and more idiotic things one after another without any sense of anything.

Most of the movie is just pointless. You could cut off over half of the movie and the movie would still be the same.

For what it is, it would have been a great short film. For the length and content, most is just pointless waste of time. My girlfriend fell asleep for a while but she missed nothing from then plot! This tells a lot.

19 May 2022,Probably the dumbest movie of the century!,"I really enjoyed watching every single scene of the movie. I think it portrayed a real family. I wish everyone enjoyed being together with the religion of this film, instead of all complaining about why our life is not as it should be! I wish parents would learn to be friends with their children instead of hacking their country's religions by force! I wish we had true love for our families, instead of fighting all the time, and the adults should not just teach their children the things they love! I wish we were wise! ....

7 March 2023,Storytelling at its finest.,"From the depth of the characters, to the playfulness with what is indeed a simple, yet important reminder, to appreciate what you have - here and now, this film had me enthralled from beginning to end. I walked out from my first viewing completely speechless and in awe of the creativity and thoughtfulness put into this feature. I love the imagination used to tell the simple story of a family, doing what they can to get by, and Michelle Yeohs character experiencing a conflict so deeply human - it was a humbling and beautiful experience through and through. I look forward to checking back in with this movie though my lifetime.

13 September 2022,Out of Left Field,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is an experimental, fast and quirky fantasy movie with humorous elements featuring a balanced cast combining veteran actresses and actors such as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan with young and talented newcomers such as Stephanie Hsu and Tallie Medel.

The movie revolves around laundry shop owner Evelyn Wang who faces quite a few challenges in her life. Her elderly father keeps criticizing her, she fails to show any affection to her delicate husband who wants to divorce her, her daughter feels misunderstood regarding her sexual identity and her poorly aged business is facing bankruptcy. Just as everything seems to be falling apart, Evelyn Wang gets the opportunity to experience different scenarios based upon important life choices she has made. The elderly woman experiences her career as a famous actress, as a martial artist or a lesbian with deformed fingers. However, all these alternative realities are menaced by the anger, deception and despair of her daughter. Evelyn Wang must find a way to connect with her daughter in order to find her way back to reality and solve her numerous problems.

On the positive side, this movie convinces with creative, fluid and unexpected storytelling. The different realities are colourful, exotic and funny. The movie comes around with multiple surprises out of left field that will keep the audience watching until the very end. The acting performances keep the movie together as especially the veteran actresses and actors convincingly play characters with depth, heart and soul.

On the negative side, the film's storytelling can at times be overwhelming and needs a lot of acceptance, focus and patience to be enjoyed to the fullest. The story itself is walking on thin ice and filled with quite a few stereotypes hidden by the bubbly characters and alternative realities.

At the end of the day, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a movie that will divide the masses. Some might call it pretentious nonsense offered at a headache-inducing speed while others will praise its unconventional storytelling and unique characters. No matter where you stand on the issue, one thing is undeniable: this movie is unlike any other you have ever watched and therefore worth everyone's attention. Personally, I'm glad to see that there are still movies that manage to surprise me and push cinematic experiences to a new level.",8
18 March 2023,Just embrace it,"I feel compelled to counter all the negative and low scores on here with a positive review. Yes it was hectic and all over the place, but how awesome was that? The world needs more thinking well outside the box, and to stop taking ourselves so seriously all the time. When was the last time any of us just let out mind wander and see where it goes?

Under all the crazy shifts was a very relatable and emotional story about expectation, acceptance, love and the choices we make - This was painful, beautiful and moving. It is all of us wondering what else we could do or be - a mirror held up to us about how our biases and expectations limit our own potential.

It's a different way of thinking that isn't typical, it's beyond the binary black and white. In so many ways it's like the neurodiverse showing the neurotypical majority/norm what's inside our heads - an entirely different way of solving problems or telling a story that doesn't follow norms or a specified format or process. That Michelle Yeohs character's superpowers were hidden, she was hidden and made herself smaller to follow convention was the absolute kicker - because this is the experience of so many who are different and walk this world with our own multiverses going on inside our heads feeling like weirdos.

This was messy, frenetic, bonkers and painfully relatable and beautiful all at the time time. Just let go of your expectations and enjoy a fantastic ride!",9
13 November 2022,"For God's Sake People, Open Your Gobs And Talk To Your Loved Ones.","Greetings And Salutations, and welcome to my review of Everything Everywhere All At Once; here's the breakdown of my ratings:

Story: 1.50 Direction: 1.75 Pace: 1.75 Acting: 1.25 Enjoyment: 1.25

TOTAL: 7.75 out of 10.00.

Here's the thing, this film isn't that brilliant. However, what's clever is how the writers and directors wrap up a simple moral premise within an outrageous and semi-entertaining narrative and movie. They then smack you around the head with two iron bars that hold the virtuosity inscribed upon them; just to drive it into your noggins.

The moral - Open Up And Fly: open your ears; open your eyes; open your hearts; open your mind; But, most of all, open your mouths and talk to one another, especially your loved ones. This process is your standard fundamental enlightenment, which many of us stupid humans fail at, myself included.

Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert wrap up this nugget of comprehension in the tale of a dysfunctional family living in America. The mother, Evelyn Wang, is teetering on the brink of a breakdown. She's overworked and overrun by everything in her life. Her sick and dying father has moved into their small apartment. He's an old-fashioned Chinese who always wanted a male heir; a daughter was never good enough. She's unsure of her feelings towards her husband, Waymond; he's changed over the years and is no longer the man she married. Her daughter, Joy appears to be stuck in the teenage angst years, moping about all day and pouting. Even though she's not unhappy about her daughter's sexual preferences, she can't bring herself to tell her old-fashioned father that his granddaughter is homosexual. And then the intimidating, iniquitous IRS decides it's an ideal time for an audit. So things are looking as bleak as they ever could be for poor, ageing Evelyn. And they're not going to get any brighter. Evidently, before enlightenment shines, you need to stand on the verge of, and stare into, the abyss of the obsidian bagel of everything everywhere all at once. To get Evelyn to this moment of realisation and change, the writers bring in a multiverse of other Evelyns and her family members. They brought each of these Evelyns into life by using her choices. For example, in one universe, she ignores her father when he tells her not to run so fast and ends up falling, head and eyes first, onto broken chopsticks, leaving her blind. In another, she chooses not to elope with Waymond, remaining at home with her parents, she becomes a top martial artist and finds fortune and fame in the Chinese movie industry. It's one of these other multiverse hubbies that tack this ""Worst Life Ever"" Evelyn down, hoping she can halt the disruption Jobu Topaki is wreaking across the multiverse. This initial meeting is the start of Evelyn's great-awakening journey. The two Dan's do a superb job of multiverse building, and though some of them are super-silly, you never feel confused about what is happening in the story. Another bonus is the strong character-building they achieve. Everyone in the tale feels real. Moreover, they come across as believable. I knew this when I began to get the niggling feeling that Joy and Jobu needed a good smack to set them straight in their miss-thinking ways. Getting me to feel this shows the strength of their creations. Well Done, Dan and Dan. However, it's not all light and joy for the double D's. They have a failing - Comedy. There are moments when it works and many when it doesn't. It comes down to one reason, puerility. The story is strong and mature, yet sadly, the buffoonery is adolescent toilet humour and pretty unfunny, neigh, I'll say cringe-worthy. Worst yet, it spoils all the fine work they'd done before and after. I'm talking about the buttplug power to fight better and the dildo slap of death. Both of these could have been funnier if handled better. One element this film displays is America's terrible at double entendres; or that Jamie Lee Curtis's comedic timing and punch are woefully lacking. But I'll put it firmly at the feet of the Double D's as they wrote the truly unamusing and lame ""hotdogs as fingers"" sketch.

That aside, they are entirely different animals behind the lens. And this juxtaposition makes the movie more entertaining and powerful. The two Dans dare to try both simple and tricky camera antics to intensify the viewers' excitement and hold their attention. The fight scenes are beautifully blended. They take the cutting to the next level as they utilise everything. What I admired most is how many fights had pauses dotted throughout them. Making them rollercoaster rides within the major coaster ride of the story. Jackie Chan used this feature a lot in his combat sequences. It allowed the director to add in extra human touches, like running out of breath, feeling pain, etc, which also added humour, before the incredibly breathtaking punches and kicks flew again. The Dans employ them to display a character's thoughts and realisation and multiverse flashes. In fact, the only place they stumble is with the puerile humour. For me, it's shot too crisply and cleanly, which diminished its power to make me giggle.

I've always been a fan of Michelle Yeoh, right from her early days when she starred alongside Jackie Chan in Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars. And though that movie had some cheesy moments, her performances never stunk. And neither does her portrayal of Evelyn. Everything Everywhere All At Once shows what a dynamite powerhouse she's become. But this movie wouldn't be so enjoyable if we didn't have Ke Huy Quan as Waymond. Quan superbly shifts from cuckold wimp to kick-arse hero mode flawlessly. If he'd been unable to sell the credibility of either character and the transition between them, the film would've bombed, and fast. And I can never say a bad word about the excellent James Hong. He's another stalwart actor who's seldom given a poor performance. The cast would've been perfect had Stephanie Hsu given her character more oomph. Even as Jobu, when she's all peacocked up, she's drab and dull. This fault may stem from the Double D's idea of her characters. However, more personality wouldn't have gone amiss. She's so tediously bland that she's nearly nonexistent - Jobu! The worst villain ever.

Remove the horrid humour, and you have an engaging and entertaining moralistic story and film. As such, I'd highly recommend it to both Martial Arts fans and Sci-Fi nuts. I'll be returning to it soon, though it'll just be to watch Michelle Yeoh kick arse. Just remember the moral and open up, speak out, but do it respectfully.

Now you've finished watching this self-help picture for the Department of Mental Health, sit down, take a deep breath, and please read my IMDb lists - Holding Out For A Hero, The Final Frontier, and Just For Laughs to see where I rated Everything Everywhere All At Once.

No movie, and I mean NO movie, has ever made me feel the way this movie did. And it's a feeling I can't comprehend yet. But I'll get there, and it will be all that more rewarding. One of the greatest films ever made, and A24's best film to date. See this movie.

20 December 2022,Mind boggling!,"This movie is not for everyone. Those viewers conditioned to accepting the usual fodder of simple plots with black & white cardboard cutout characters could be stretching their tiny peas towards potential brain aneurisms. But the imagination shown by the creators is simply astounding. Not since Ken Russell or Quentin Tarentino has there been such a unique, quirky universe as this one created by Dan Kwan & Daniel Scheinert. Is it a dream? - a hallucination? Maybe, but it's a philosophical roller coaster - with an extremely emotional conclusion! Every actor in it delivers their best performances. With the extraordinary Michelle Yeoh at the helm this movie offers a more spectacular ride than what Disney or the blockbuster franchises could ever hope to create.

13 March 2023,Cinematic crescendo!!!,"By the end of this timeless classic, you are just left in awe gaping and wondering at the art you have witnessed. If you live life to the fullest, this movie will tug at all your heart strings. The ebb and flow will keep you invested and on the edge of your seat. All the elements add up to one big ending which is crescendo personified. The characters all portray something meaningful and worthwhile. You root for them and hope they come through. It is the humaneness in us that makes us want to see them victorious. The complexity of relationship. The empathy, kindness, and openness all come to the fore.

28 May 2022,A serious movie disguised as a silly movie:,"Wow. I rarely leave reviews but this one absolutely deserved one. Kudos to the directors for writing such a stunning movie. I'm a 58 year old, white, grandmother of five and I could relate to every.single.character.

It's a story of parent/daughter relationships sprinkled with remorse for dreams not fulfilled, paths not taken, focusing on the wrong things in life, and, eventually, realizing that Be Kind/Accept People For Who They Are is what everyone should strive for in this blink of an eye existence we all have. Each and every actor was excellent. In my opinion EEAO should win all the awards.

19 August 2022,Parents just don't understand,"Everyone speaks different dialects or languages. No one seems to express everything they feel. As a result...chaos. Of course, this representation of chaos is extreme and fun/crazy/over-the-top! But it's all about family and I loved every dysfunctional second. As a mom, is the great evil the power of our children? Are we parents the great evil in our children's lives? Probably.

This movie is so brilliant that I had to watch it twice. I actually don't love all the martial arts fighting but it still works. Fantastic!

18 March 2023,Most people just have no sense of humor,"I watched the movie two times on one day. Recognized so many witty details almost hidden. Does anyone saw that the sausage hand scene the kitchen gloves has long fingers too? This accurate filmmakers make a good movie to watch more. By the way, sausage hand scene was not stupid, it just wanted to emphasize that yes extreme things might happen in a parallel universe. The movie was about quantum physics. The title itself refer to the superposition theory, Shr√∂dinger's cat.

Who gives low rating, simply just have no sense of humor. And if they don't know this fact, they have problem with intelligence as well. It's a good, entertaining, action comedy. Acting was brilliant, totally deserve the Oscar. Unfortunately Colin didn't win the leading role.

29 January 2023,Really?,"Take the worst cliches of martial arts films, cross them with the incomprehensible nonsense of the Marvel multiverse, then top with a dash of the pseudo-intellectualism of the Matrix series and you have this mess of a movie.

While watching this with the family, about an hour in, one of us said they'd had enough and the rest of us responded with ""Thank God!"" and we gave up on it.

Just do not understand what others see in this nonsense and am completely perplexed that it received so many Academy Award nominations. That this got nominated for Best Picture while a gem such as ""Living"" didn't just makes no sense.

11 September 2023,Interesting to say the least...,"The film did lose me a couple times, no doubt about it. But I can't deny this is a quality film that had an original angle to its plot/story, good acting/cast (especially from Ke Huy Kuan, Stephanie Hsu, and Jamie Lee Curtis who all surprised me), good directing (especially the fight scenes), and good production behind it. When the movie slowed down a few times in the second half and gets more quiet/emotional, it felt more significant and it made me more invested in what would happen with the characters and the relationships. I didn't see this in theaters but I kind of wish I did. I'd recommend seeing it still for what it's worth!

Great mix of CGI & practical effects and the story was heartwarming. This was a fluke watch for me as I had not heard about it and sorta went into it blind. So glad I took a chance on it.

2 May 2022,Bizarre doesn't necessarily mean great!,"Some quick impressions after coming out of the theater: This movie is highly overrated. It has some interesting ideas, but a lot of repetition and is often dragging and boring.

It is basically a bombardment of your senses, which doesn't leave a good impression/taste.

Too much stupid fight sequences (poor story). Once over, you do not wonder about its ""deep"" meanings (if you manage to watch it until the end).

The commanding room is kind of copy/paste of The Matrix.

Not a good choice for an intelligent viewer.

20 March 2023,A Trip of a Movie!,"Don't listen to the contrarians that are ""nOt LiKe ThE oThEr GiRlS."" Every time a movie is critically acclaimed or has a minority cast, you're going to get ignorant people that tank it. Disregard them! This movie is a great and bizarre watch!

Michelle Yeoh is fantastic as the lead. Her life is crumbling, she's lost all hope in her business endeavors, her marriage is ending, and her daughter barely speaks to her. If all that isn't enough, she's being audited by the IRS and is on the edge. When it seems like it's finally going to fall apart, she gets pulled into a world she didn't know existed and now has to save.

All of the actors in this movie are incredible. They don't just play one character; they play several.

Don't look for deep life lessons from Hollywood. Movies are meant to entertain and that's exactly what this movie does.",9
26 January 2023,I wasn't impressed... then I watched it!!!,"I heard mixed reviews when this was released, with someone saying this was the best movie they have ever seen, which sounded ridiculous and my more balanced friends telling me it was absolute rubbish. It looked rubbish so I gave it a miss on the big screen. I couldn't understand the fuss and the reason it got so many oscar nominations until I watched it on a flight just, and it is absolutely...brilliant!!!!!!!! It is in fact a masterpiece... if you follow it, and understand it, and I guess if you understand human nature, human experience, heartache, frustrations and human experience. Which is what the movie is actually about. It's about one person's journey through all of this, which appears, and i use that word carefully - to take them through this multiverse of madness to bring them to a real life epiphany, a realisation of who and why they are. It is absolutely brilliant if you understand that. And probably very grotesque and annoying if you don't get it. I can see why some people hate it. You need to watch it again. It is such an emotional joy. Wow. Applause all round!!!!

10 August 2022,Superb Originality This is a 21st Century Classic,"My Review - Everything Everywhere All at Once 2022

My Rating 10/10 Thank you to my friend Cherrie G if not for you I may have overlooked this amazing movie.

There is already much written about this movie as I have discovered some of it poles apart in appreciation or lack thereof .

All I can say really for me if asked to describe my reaction to this astonishing trip between altered states and universes is to quote a Buddhist word Maitri which means benevolence, loving-kindness, friendliness, amity, good will, and active interest in others.

I'm no intellectual scholar my literary heroes and life teachers lies more with Aesop's Fables , Shakespeare or the Brothers Grimm than the great Jean-Paul Sartre or Marcel Proust .

That's probably why I kept thinking of three great movies while watching Everything Everywhere All at Once .

They were Lewis Carol's Alice in Wonderland, The Matrix and L. Frank Baume's The Wizard of Oz .

There's the same zany We're All Mad crazy characters in Alice even a drink me eat me scene the Sci Fi film noir worlds of The Matrix and the No Place Like Home journeys end of Oz.

Which brings me to mention the humour in this movie featuring Pythonesque comedy fun with raccoons ,butt plugs, hot dog hands ,and pelting pooches and pet rocks.

The producers wanted to keep the plot to this film under wraps before release earlier this year so the description just read a woman tries to do her taxes.

The woman is Evelyn Wang played by the wonderful International star Michelle Yeoh . This film even features her red carpet glamorous catwalk scene in one of her other famous films Crazy Rich Asians when Evelyn experiences what fame can bring in another life choice.

Evelyn Wang is stressed to her limits with her laundromat under audit , her daughter Joy's lifestyle choice a problematic marriage to husband Waymond played by Ke Huy Quan her family woes also include her elderly demanding father Gong Gong played by Veteran actor James Hong.

Most of action of the first part titled Everything of this unique Fantasy Sci-Fi Comedy of the Absurd takes place in the Office of the Internal Revenue with Evelyn's stress increasing by the second as IRS Inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre interrogates her . Deidre the IRS Inspector is played by the wonderful Jamie Lee Curtis in her greatest comedy role since her 1988 role in A Fish Called Wanda.

No spoilers from now on part 2 Everywhere takes us and our heroine Evelyn on a journey to an alternate universe to explore what her life may have been like .

This is a world where even her daughter is an alternate character Jobu Tupaki and her enemy also played by Stephanie Hsu giving a superb performance in this dual role .

I advise even if you don't like the frenetic first hour of this trip stay with this movie it's worth it. You wouldn't get off a train half way if you knew you were on your way to a beautiful destination would you?

Part 3 All at Once is a beautiful and emotional journeys end.

I'm so pleased the Daniels replaced the choice of Jackie Chan as the lead to Michelle Yeoh as I think a woman with family and life stresses has a vulnerability that a male character would have lacked.

I was very interested to read that the writers directors Daniel Scheinart and Daniel Kwan originally intended for Evelyn to have undiagnosed ADHD.

Daniel Kwan researched the condition and discovered that he himself had undiagnosed ADHD.

I really loved this movie as it has a strong message for me about the world we live in today where the pursuit of excellence and high achievement seem to have left the battlers and ordinary achievers behind making many doubt themselves and the life choices they've made in other words it's ok to fail we can always have another try . Kindness and empathy for each other are better qualities than prestige and power.

I can't wait to see it again hopefully on a Cinema Screen.",10
8 April 2023,a perfect representation of generational trauma and feeling unloveable.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

23 March 2023,Excellent!!,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a unique and entertaining movie that combines elements of comedy and science fiction. However, it falls short of being a top-notch movie due to its not-so-serious nature and the way it mixes genres.

The movie describes its subtext very well, and there was not the slightest gap in the screenplay. The acting was successful, although it did not quite deserve an Oscar. The editing was done exceptionally well, which added to the overall quality of the film.

At times, the pacing of the film is so frenetic that it's easy to miss important details even if one is watching very carefully. The film moves from one scene to the next without giving the audience much time to catch their breath or fully absorb what's happening on screen.

This high tempo can be frustrating, as the movie has a lot of interesting ideas and concepts that it wants to explore. However, because of the breakneck pace, some of these ideas are not given the time and attention they deserve. Despite this, the movie is an original work that is sure to captivate audiences with its unique story and philosophical depth.

The philosophical depth of the movie is what sets it apart from other films in the genre. The themes of identity, choice, and the nature of reality are explored in a way that is both thought-provoking and entertaining.

Overall, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a solid movie with an 88/100 rating. While it may not be a top-notch movie, it is still an enjoyable and unique film that is definitely worth watching.",9
20 March 2023,Boring,"Halfway through this film, I just lost interest. I persevered thinking it it must get better due to the Oscars and praise etc... but it didn't. I did see it to the end but felt annoyed I'd wasted 2 hours and I know I'll never watch it again.

Yes I understand the message it was trying to convey and make us think about things but I cared not for any of the characters. It must have been some sort of token nod from the academy for all the awards because I'm at a complete loss to see anything positive or remotely interesting about this film.

It was simply dull and there's no excuse for that. Shame.

24 April 2023,Can't deny originality in a sea of the same old,"Sure it's bizarre and goofy but that's part of the charm. People complain about how nothing is original these days but once they watch something truly original and one of a kind they hate it. It is so clever and the actors sold the parts so well. The set design and costume design was fantastic and the music was perfect. Tells a story of a broken family putting the pieces back together all while all the characters are action heros also. Loved the villain and she killed the role.

""But that doesn't make any sense!"" ""Exactly"" Keep those lines in mind as you watch the movie cause it's telling you it doesn't matter it doesn't make sense. Gets a little cheese but most movies do anyway. Highly recommend.

15 January 2023,Incredible. 1 of the BEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN.,"I just finished this. I knew nothing about it going in. That was perfect because I had no idea what to expect. I don't want to give away anything about the plot but let's just say, every actor is incredible in this. Every character is written exceptionally well but these actors in the movie and their chemistry together bring the excellent script to life. Clearly it's directed brilliantly. I've never seen anything like it. This movie is brilliant. It made me feeeeeeeel. Deeply. Everything about it is perfect imho. I wouldn't change a thing! Masterpiece! I hope they win everything.

Why are my reviews always too short? I feel like I've seen shorter reviews on here but they always tell me I need more cha.

27 December 2022,Ke Huy Quan is SO amazing in this film!,"He literally steals every scene he is in and I hope this vaults him into more acting gigs finally! Hell, they should do immediate rewrites on the new Indiana Jones movie and get him in there! Yeoh is also equally incredible. I mean overall this is probably the most creative piece of cinema I've seen in ages. I really do hope it beats The Fabelmans for Best Picture. As much as I love Spielberg, he's won enough. Not only would it be great for the Asian community but this film had a ridiculously low budget and small team and that kind of originality from a small group of creatives needs to be supported and awarded for all to see. I seriously look forward to awards season this time! Go short round!

14 August 2022,Not sure I've ever seen anything quite like this,"A highly original piece of film construction with an obscure title that ends up being quite appropriate because that is what happens. I loved Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan in the leads, was sort of amazed by the ninety something James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis seems to be having a great time, much more than I did, though a lot of it is funny, some of it exhausting and nearly all of it is eye-popping non-stop happenings. Kudos to Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert for another truly original film. After this and Swiss Army Man it cannot be denied that these writers/directors have truly unique visions. I look forward to what's next. However, this is the most immense production to get to the simple, basic premise that life would be much happier if we would accept and appreciate what we've got and be kinder and nicer to each other. Others may view it differently, but that's my take on this very unusual film.

22 February 2023,"Violent, pretentious-- also original and wildly imaginative. But...","After having read many of the reviews here it seems that, well, some people get this movie, and some people don't. I'm in the latter group. There's no doubt that this is a movie unlike any other; the creativity is off the charts. The acting is superb. The direction terrific. But there's no substance outside of a feel good message about... something: hard to say what. Still, the most salient part of the movie, and something few people seem to be talking about, is that it's possibly the most violent movie of the year, if not the decade. Once the roller coaster begins it's one excruciating fight scene after another, all beautifully choreographed, and all bloody horrible. So if you like originality combined with imagination, constant bloodshed, and a completely incoherent plot, this is your movie.

One of the movie that I stood there watching without a blink and dont feel bored easily like other films so far. This is kind of movie that any directors should direct, with no cliche comedy, no cliche drama, and to much CGI just to backup bad story telling.

9 February 2023,Pure beauty,"This is one of the best, most beautiful, most emotional films I have seen in recent years. Beyond Kung fu, beyond incredible special effects, beyond acting that's better than you would expect, you find pure emotion. You find the essence, you find the beauty, you find the secret of humanity. You even find the key to happiness, through simple acts. By simply listening to those around you. By simply trying to make others happy. And in my opinion, the 11 Oscar nominations are more than deserving! It is pure beauty, from start to finish.

Or, of course, you can just see it as a martial arts film. The choice is yours.

29 May 2022,Well then...,"If you are a fan of the movie Lamb, Gold, Pig, Prisoners of Ghostland, etc... then you probably would like this movie as well.

Sometimes I feel like Hollywood is experimenting with us or something and I agree with a lot of people's view that these movies are ""Emperor's New Clothes,"" a lot of groupthink, people just afraid to be honest about it, they just want to be in the hype and jump on the bandwagon.

The story and plot is completely convoluted and makes little sense. It seems to be like a magic eight ball of unrelated events trying hard to mash together. The characters are typical in an American comedy, they act like they're on coke, always fidgeting, twitching, and talking very very fast in a sarcastic tone. I remember first seeing Shia popularize this in Transformers. Was never a fan.

That's all just from the film itself, adding in the woke indoctrination and preaching, this film scores an easy 1 for me.",1
23 April 2023,Psychology and philosophy of life.,"Psychology and philosophy of life. Starting from the premise that God probably does not exist, we are ephemeral beings doomed to a brief, forgettable, and invisible existence for an overwhelming percentage of the universe. Nothing makes sense, nothing matters. Everything will cease to exist for you and me in a shorter time than we imagine. We are completely helpless beings, there is no sense in so much struggle, so much suffering. Neither joy nor pain, all of this will pass. But living what is good is the only thing that seems to make a little sense in this life. At least that's what we try to choose. That's what seems to make it worth it, just a little bit. We smile, we hug each other. That matters, at least in this brevity we call life. The rest is just nonsense and a waste of time. That is the message of the film, which used this crazy idea of parallel universes to draw our attention to this. And it worked. If they had tried to make a philosophical and psychological film to explain it, only a handful of people would have seen it.

16 June 2022,Absolutely amazing,"I've been watching this movie again and again since it came out last year and it gets better every time. This is the first movie that gives me something more every time I rewatch it. There's a small thing that I see on a rewatch that I haven't seen earlier. It's such an overwhelming experience, it feels exactly like the title says. It's an exhausting movie that leaves you just thinking about it afterwards. You just want to sit back in silence and think about everything.

It's so many things all at once it definitely is not for everyone. But for me, it was exactly what I would want from a movie.

19 May 2022,Great,"What can I say that hasn't been said before?

Just about everything in this movie is top-notch.

The acting - from every actor -, the directing - which I've only seen their Swiss Army Man when it came out and had a lot of fun with it-, the visuals and especially the editing is just amazing in this movie.

It has a really good story and it's funny as hell, like I didn't expect it to make me laugh this much. It's definitely one of the best movies of these past couple years.

I enjoyed it very much, but the only reason I'm giving it an 8 and not a 9, is because I didn't really have the emotional connection that people seem to have with the ending of this movie, and the ending, although great, I didn't find it mind-blowingly amazing to warrant it a 9.

I usually cringe when a conflict, especially a world-ending one, is solved by the power of ""love""! And I really hate it when this trope is used to end a story. But in this case, it really worked for this movie and I have no complaint about that aspect of it. Just that I wasn't too emotionally invested in their relationship, or better to say that the mother-daughter relationship didn't resonate with me that much. I don't know, it probably would've worked for me better if it was a father and son. And I'm not saying that just because I'm a man, I'm saying that because I know that that worked better in a movie like About Time. Or maybe it's because they showed that father and son relationship just a teeny bit better that made me invest in their characters and relationships better.

I probably will change my mind on a second or multiple viewings, but for now, I think it's a solid 8. Although it's automatically a 9 since we hadn't have a movie this good in so many years. (Except for Parasite) And it looks like that a lot of people, understandably, compare this to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but I don't think it's comparable. One is a stand-alone movie that wraps up its own story in the runtime it has, and the other is like an episode to a cinematic universe that should be watched like a tv show. So why not enjoy both?

And it's fair if you don't like how Marvel movies work and that you have to watch lots of other movies before a ""sequel"" to a movie that came out in 2016, it's your choice and opinion, you don't like the way they do movies or you don't like the movie at all. But let people who enjoy both movies enjoy both of them and don't start a war over it.

Although if we were to compare these two movies with each other, EEAAO is definitely the superior movie. It has better visuals and editing, and the story and how it is told is definitely better here.

But I enjoyed the horror and gothic aspect of Doctor Strange too and really had fun with it, and even though I gave that one an 8 too, it's actually a 7.5 for me and obviously lower than this movie, but I still enjoyed both of them for different reasons.

One thing I didn't really find that great in this movie though, was the score. Now, the music and the sound mixing was great in this movie. But for some scenes, especially the ending, I thought the music could've been used in a better way. It's the only thing I think this movie is lacking. And like I said, it might be become better on a second-viewing.

And although they did a good job of explaining how the multiverse jump work, I am still confused about somethings, especially with the Bluetooth headphones they have.

All in all, it's a great movie and definitely the best movie since 2019. (of the ones I've watched)",8
9 July 2022,All at once,"Wow. It's been a while since a movie blew me away as much as this did. This has to be by far one of the best movies I've seen this year. And I wish I saw this in theaters but never went for it. Go into this as blind as you can, it's worth it.

The mix of adventure, drama and comedy is so well balanced, it's inspiring. The acting is phenomenal, the score and music is top tier, the vfx, the directing.. I could go on praising this movie and to be honest I guess I'm just on a high a.t.m. And can't so a lot of faults. But are there many? Besides the whole multiverse complexity, sure it becomes so complex at a point you have to really remove logic from the equation. At first you try, but it quickly tells you to just accept it.

The only negative I could notice whilst watching where some blatant ''telling the viewer what's going on'' moments. With the complexity it's understandable why they did it, but to me it felt like ''yes, I know already'' This was in the early part only though. But that's like... the only thing I could find and imo is nitpicking.

It's a 2+ hour movie and it feels like that but also doesn't feel like that. Because of it's unique moments and editing choices it will make you aware of the time. Which leads to it. I loved the choice, but it also had it's repercussions.

Special shoutout to the VFX work and directing/editing. It's so incredibly creative, the backstories, the methods of how they show things, the simple but brilliant scenes. Conceptually this movie ranks extremely high. The main story is touching and emotional, but the movie never forgets it's a comedy, but you'll hear tears in your eyes and laugh at the same time. It deals with Chinese parenting traditions/stereotypes in quite a obvious way but the dad made all the difference in it becoming repetitive.

I have yet to see other works from these directors but I'm acing to watch anything they come up with next. This movie truly felt like a work of art and passion.

This is a special movie, and up there to be watched again.",9

28 November 2022,Aimless Mixed up Jumble,"What a god awful movie. It was as if the producers/director/actors wanted to see if you would fall for complete garbage and call it art. And by the ratings, you did.

I have been reading and watching science fiction and fantasy since before most of you were born and this nonsense is near the bottom of my list. I'm amazed I watched to the end.

According to the ratings this movie is almost as good as ""Lord of the Ring"" or ""The Martian"".

Not even close!

As for the characters, it's hard to find one to empathize with. Maybe Evelyn, maybe Joy, but even that is pushing it.

The story itself is incomplete in every way. Nothing can be truly understood by the viewer and yes, I think that is deliberate. They want you confused and want you to enjoy that and call it artful, innovative and reflective of the current year. Dreck!

Sorry, no, I wasn't fooled. Try again with the aim of entertaining the audience.",1
13 September 2022,Wonderful!,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

29 May 2022,A heartfelt tale told in the most insane way,"This film manages to balance out so many things that I think a multitude of people will appreciate. You've got a likeable cast with a creative concept that grabs you and doesn't let go for the duration of the viewing. I believe there is a high chance you will walk out of this film feeling good and find yourself pondering the type of lessons imbedded in the story. One gripe I had, which I guess you could call a nitpick, is that it felt just a little too long. Perhaps ten minutes could've been cut so we could get to certain points faster. In the end, Everything Everywhere All at Once is as down to earth as it is ambitiously creative and is a viewing experience where you may take away more than you thought. One of the best films of 2022 so far. Verdict: 9/10.

5 April 2023,#1 multiverse,"""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is a mind-bending, genre-blending sci-fi comedy that takes viewers on a wild ride through multiple dimensions and timelines. Directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, the film stars Michelle Yeoh as a retired physicist who finds herself caught up in an interdimensional adventure involving a mysterious box, a quantum entanglement device, and a cast of eccentric characters.

One of the strengths of this film is its ability to seamlessly weave together elements of comedy, drama, action, and science fiction. The humor is often irreverent and absurd, but it never feels forced or out of place. The action scenes are inventive and thrilling, but they are also grounded in the characters' emotional journeys. And the sci-fi concepts are mind-bending and thought-provoking, but they are presented in a way that is both accessible and entertaining.

Another standout aspect of ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is its diverse and talented cast. Michelle Yeoh is a force to be reckoned with as the film's lead, and she is surrounded by a supporting cast that includes Stephanie Hsu, Jamie Lee Curtis, and James Hong. Each actor brings a unique energy and perspective to their role, making the ensemble feel like a true ensemble.

The film's visual style is also worth noting. The cinematography is colorful and dynamic, with clever use of camera angles and lighting to convey the film's many moods and tones. The visual effects are impressive as well, seamlessly blending practical and digital effects to create a world that feels both fantastical and real..",8
17 February 2023,Loved the twists,"Directors Dan Kwan & Daniel Schienert masterfully co directed and co wrote this wonderful film of multiple realities melding several realms and creating a symbiotic finish. Tons of quirkiness filled with genuine inflection and introspection of inner and outer turmoil within each person and everyone they have a relationship with resulting in continual flux of the stories. Thoroughly enjoyed the story within a story within a storyline. Brava and bravo to the actors for their performances. They captivate us with all of the multiple personalities that come to the surface. Feeling the range of emotions that they express and many times throughout cause confusion. Thank you for this quirky multiple rearmed movie.

26 May 2022,"It's everything, everywhere, all at once. And it's remarkable.","The Good: You know a movie is special when the impeccable action scenes, unmatched creativity, and incredible performances aren't what stands out. It's the deep, unapologetic humanity and character dynamics - so realistic and raw - that really puts Everything, Everywhere, All At Once over the top for me. It's also a film that reminds me of what science fiction is really about: using these out there concepts to comment upon the human experience. This film is really a metaphor for adult life; how we often have to juggle so many things pulling at us and lose sight of what really matters: people, relationships, and the time we have with them.

To say Michelle Yeoh is great here is an understatement. She's truly remarkable and excels in every role she plays in this movie: she's funny, she's a fantastic martial artist, she's glamorous, she's relatable. Maybe the Daniels had some fairy dust in their pockets or something, because almost every actor here - required to play multiple versions of themselves - are OUTSTANDING. Key Huy Quan's Waymond is perhaps my favourite character of the year so far; he's so effortlessly lovable and brings so much pathos to this role. I also want to shout Stephanie Hsu out; she's not getting a ton of attention but her performance is so good the scenes of her and Michelle Yeoh almost brought me to tears (I'll freely admit Quan and Yeoh's scenes LITERALLY brought me to tears).

But, of course none of this is what people are *really* talking about with this movie. This movie's energy is on another level, I've never seen anything quite like it. It's both quick and snappy, but makes complete sense. Just when I was getting a bit bored with the setting, the film transitions at the exact right moment. The ending feels earned and in line with the film's themes. Everything just clicks...everywhere and all at once.

The action is next level. This movie was apparently written for Jackie Chan and I have to say, Yeoh and Quan are amazing stand ins for him. The influence of Hong Kong action films is palpable and unmistakable. In an era where I usually go into passive mode watching action scenes, EEAO had my eyes glued to the screen. It has some of the funniest, most interesting, and dynamic action sequences I have ever seen. Every time I thought I knew what was gonna happen, something entirely different did.

And if this movie couldn't be even more intricate and well made, its very existence if reflective of the Asian American experience. You couldn't have this movie without China, yet it's still clearly a very American movie. God, I freakin' love this movie.

The Bad: Honestly, this is one of the movies that I'd be nitpicking if I had to go through what was ""bad."" Maybe one or two scenes i think didn't need to be there, maybe some dialog that's a bit on the nose. But nah, this thing rocks.

The Ugly: 2022 is shaping up to be a truly amazing year for film. I'm so happy that we've seen a new generation of visionaries take centre stage, and I can't wait to see what the Daniels' do next. If Swiss Army Man was the appetizer, Everything Everywhere All At Once feels like the main course, a statement film that (I hope) elevates audience expectations as to what mainstream film making can be. No scratch that, it elevates expectations as to what life can be. I felt myself just a little happier, just a little more appreciative of my life and the people who are a part of it.

With all the stuff happening in the world, I'm happy I'm in the universe where this film exists.",10
4 December 2022,Brilliantly bonkers,"I read the blurb and watched the first few seconds of the trailer before deciding I'd probably be best to just dive right in. That was an excellent decision, even if I do say so myself.

I'm not really into action movies, and despite this being full of action sequences, it's not really an action movie.

I loved the fact that essentially this was a film about people and the expectations they put on themselves and others, how they think others see them and how they see others.

The importance of needing to stand up and fight, but to also be kind.

I started crying with bemused laughter at the hotdog sausages and I knew then I was watching one of the best films ever.

I loved it. Brilliant.",10
22 March 2023,What a waste of time...,"I think those who gave this movie a high review are on drugs.

You will never gain back the time wasted, it's over two hours of nonsense.

The subject matter of the story is all over the place as if the writer and the director wanted to cram all their beliefs into this movie and shove it up our a$s'.

This is definitely a movie with an agenda to try brainwash the masses.

The only reason I decided to watch this was because it had won seven Oscar categories, never again will I go by these idiots who don't know right from wrong. There definitely seems to be a bias in the Oscar elite society when it comes to voting movie. That much is clear.

I'm not gonna give any spoilers but this movie is probably one of the best ones I've seen this year, Oscar worthy no doubts.

Update: no matter how many times I watch this movie it's still teaching me that a lot of times we hope to be somewhere else when we actually we could enjoy the here and now.

9 April 2023,perfectly named,"This is a movie that can only come out in 2022.

A wild ride of LSD like trippyness in a family story.

Thats what is boils down to, a story of a family.

Watching interviews, the writers are not even totally sure what this is exactly about, but it doesnt matter.

When i saw this with my family, not a single one of them liked it or enjoyed it, but i thought it worked and the weirdness from the eccentric fighting to the hot dog fingers, that can only work today.

If im old and someone asks me what is was like in my time, this is what im going to show them. They might not understand, but the emotions displayed in this are what go through my mind a ton.

Most of this movie's problem is that while is does present these ideas well, it does dive a bit too deep into these wild ideas, which holds it back a little. It still leaves me thinking about it to this day.",9
30 July 2022,"An unparalleled bizarre cinema masterpiece that approaches the multiverse in a fresh, new, ingenious way.","I have no idea what I just witnessed. Everything Everywhere All at Once is unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. This brilliant goofy, zany, ridiculous genius movie will fry your brain cells. This film instantly establishes itself as a necessity for any true cinema lover. Ground-breaking writing that feels like a Christopher Nolan script with no limits and some eccentricity mixed in. I'm not sure if I fully enjoyed the movie, but I also can't say I fully understand everything Everything Everywhere All at Once is. Not a film for everyone but an absolute must for movie fans or sci-fi enthusiasts.

11 June 2022,Pieces of corn,"Gilda Radner said the first write is the barf , the rewrite is when you pick out the pieces of corn. A rewrite would make this movie more lethal but I don't know if the overall impact on the audience and therefore box office receipts would be that much different. This movie is a significant event in the world of indie movie production as it demonstrates the importance of balls in making films happen. There's a lot of talent and texture here if not cohesion. That's Hollywood, thank god.

26 May 2022,Masterpiece,"You can expect everything in this movie.

The action scenes are really well done! The CGI is perfect. The acting is brilliant, the plot is surprisingly gripping considering how frequently movies these days just throw in the word ""multiverse"" and expect it to make sense, this movie respects that word and presents it in a way that makes sense within the movie's context.

The comedy is simply top level, I was laughing every time there was a joke or when humorous contexts came up. It doesn't go out of its way to be funny, the comedy is presented in a fluid way.

The other thing that this movie does excellently is presenting the female protagonist! They, not once, shove it in the audience's face that she's a woman, they simply present the character and their path towards strength. So many directors mess this up and use exposition or arrogance to make their point about a female character, but here, its characters are being portrayed perfectly, even the old people are portrayed well.

10/10.",10
27 March 2023,"Tries very hard to be smart, but fails miserably","I wonder if people who are enthusiastic about this mess of a movie have seen The Matrix, Inception, Brazil, Mr. Nobody and other movies I am too bored to mention; these movies have come years before this one and are still a giant leap above this pretentious bunch of thrown-there ideas.

There are some precious moments, and the movie is highly imaginative, but it looks like there was noone in the cast who was entitled to say ""ok guys, this is too much"".

If this movie were aimed at smart people, it should have told far less than it does; it looks like it hardly tries to tell you how smart and unconventional the writers are, and they Keep the secret message of the movie for the end of the movie, except for there is no real secret, and the meaning behind the story is dull and oh-so-obvious.

It is not a terrible movie, but it is probably the most overhyped and overrated movie to win so much oscars in the movie history.",5

11 June 2022,This movie truly is everything everywhere all at once,"It is hard to imagine a movie that is comical, funny, cool, chaotic, dark and refreshing all at once. Yet the creative minds behind the scenes was able to pack this majestic roller-coaster all into one movie.

This one-of-a-kind film is able to hold up to its ambition of paying homage to multiple genres across the mutiverse and delivering on multiple themes while not feeling disjointed, and the experience just gets better for the Chinese audience who understand the language. Although the movie crumbles slightly at the end under its own weight, and some themes could be developed more profoundly, with strong visuals, cleverly designed gigs, eccentric acting and immersive editing, this textbook version of cinema has excelled in all technical aspects of achievement that few other have achieved.

12 March 2023,Not Good,"I don't get all the buzz around this film. It's a poorly conceived derivative idea that fails to tell a cogent story. It tries to be Scott Pilgrim vs The Matrix in a Marvel-like multiverse... but Everything Everywhere All at Once is just not very good. As a children's movie it's fine, and I suppose if it wasn't up for all these awards I would have just submitted an average review... but, it is up for a bunch of awards, and I felt a responsibility to balance out all of the nonsense. I tried watching it with several people from different genders, races, ages, and sexual orientations. Nobody liked Everything Everywhere All at Once, most wouldn't even finish it. Waste your time if you must see what all the ""buzz"" is about.... But don't say I didn't warn you.

27 May 2022,Yeoh really don't want to miss this,"Ten minutes into Everything, Everywhere All at Once you already know all you need to about Evelyn Wang and her life. She runs a struggling laundry mart and is in some way estranged from every member of her family. She is a dissapiontment to her visiting father, resents here carefree husband who's cheery outlook on life she sees as weakness and while she worries nothing she has done matters she struggles to connect with her daughter who worries nothing at all matters.

Broadly speaking the movies follows Evelyn working through her family issues via Kung Fu, universe hopping and confronting a reality threatening bagel. If that sounds crazy its only scratching the surface, the film packs in a lot. It also a masterpiece. From Uncut Gems style stress to melancholy to exhilaration, the directors make you feel whatever they want on a whim and while Michelle Yeoh is the undoubted star of the show every cast member is outstanding. Really saying anything more (other than everyone should see this film) could only spoil things.

It'll make you gasp, it'll make you laugh, it'll probably make you cry. It'll make you want to hug your kids. An instant all time classic.",10

Romance, if I were to compare it to Dr Strange multiverse of madness, is all the more present here than it was in MoM, really liked it.

4 September 2022,Everybody needs everyone to love everybody everywhere at all times!,"There aren't many action films depicting the mother/daughter bond, so this welcome addition surpasses everybody's expectations. But that isn't even half the film's draw!

Finally back on screen, my personal favourite sidekick or comic relief in big action-adventure blockbusters, Data/Shortstop from the unique Goonies and fun Indy films comes back with a bang! His bag of tricks on show for all to awe at! He's the North to Michelle's Crouching housewife, Hidden talent in the Laundry, midlife wife-crisis. And it's not ""just the taxes"" that turn the struggling business owner into a force to be reckoned with! Without giving much away, one woman must traverse multiple timelines of her life where every choice she's ever made has created a new version of herself. As we are products of our society, each version of herself has different skills. Before time runs out, she must learn to use her skills to fight off evil doppelgangers of her friends and her IRS officer (a hilarious turn from True Lies' Jamie Lee Curtis) from other universes!

Doctor Strange could take a lesson or two from the mouth-dropping visuals this films throws at the viewer, with the CGI and SFX blended seemlessly between quick, witty and relevant dialogue, majestic fight scenes, and surprises behind every turn! A feast for the eyes!

The cast playfully carry this film on their comedic, dramatic and kung fu-trained shoulders, all at once! After so many father- son bonding films, or son looking for approval, this alternate view of a parent/child relationship may be foreign to many, but will hit home to those in the know!

I didn't watch the trailer, I didn't know what it was about, the title sounded catchy and it just looked like something I would enjoy. So I went with no clue and zero expectations.

And this movie was such a revelation. It's all my depression and anxiety accumulated during many years which peaked during the pandemic expressed in a super expressive movie. It's hilarious, it's deep, it's sad, it's dark, it's annoying at times, it's colourful, it's relatable, it's hopeful, it's just everything. It allowed me to let some feelings and thoughts that had been buried deep down back to the surface again. It's given me some hope and comfort.

It's not just me and that's comforting. Maybe more people than I think are feeling like this. Maybe there's still hope of making some sense of this meaningless strange existence. Maybe there are no rules and we can embrace googly eyes.

15 August 2022,rollercoaster ride of images and ideas for five movies,"This is what a Doctor Strange-Multiverse movie should have been like: complex, witty, intelligent script, excellent performances, hillariously strange humor.

This movie is like a orgy in storytelling containing a lot of themes and delivering at each of them.

The hero of this movie is Michelle Yeoh that gives the performance of her lifetime.

Another excellent actress that will we remembered: Jamie Lee Curtis. Just hillarious.

It's nearly impossible to describe this movie. You have to see and experience it.

Why not a rating higher than 8?

The movie gets exhausting after the first twothirds, it's a little bit overlong, confusing and loses its pace by the end.

But, nonetheless, it's one of the most visionary, entertaining, strange and hillarious movies of the past years, I just say 'the stones' and 'sausage fingers'. Wow!

25 December 2022,Timeless Masterpiece,"Wow, this movie is an crazy thrilling wonderful experience. One minute I was in awe, the next minute I laugh, and then surprise then cry. Such an emotional roller-coaster and the movie did it so well. The movie is so creative and so much fun. Jumping between universes were effortless, I never got lost and some universe is so crazy couldn't stop laughing.

They manage to put so much story in such short period or time and manage to give back stories to so many characters. Everyone was great. I love it.

I wish I watch this masterpiece in the cinema. Didn't even know it was released. It is easily the best movie in 2022.

Wow.

Yay so glad it won 7oscars. We'll deserve !

When someone win something, haters will flood into destroy it. Get ready for haters bomb review lol.",10
16 April 2022,The Matrix on Meth,"No spoilers here. Only thing I can say is, it will not disappoint. Confusion that unravels into understanding. Action where it needs to be and a lot of dark humor.

13 March 2023,WTF,"I'm sitting watching this now and I haven't got a clue what it's about. People refer to it as something to do with parallel universe and a collision with the inland revenue. It's like a really bad acid trip from 50 years ago especially if you look at Jamie Lee Curtis wearing that weird hat. Michelle Yeoh seems to also be having a really bad day and lost her shampoo.

I can't work out why the Americans in their Oscar wisdom voted for this monstrosity. It must be a political motive to appear to be diverse and inclusive. As for Ke Huy Quan winning an Oscar..... jolly nice chap but technically how can you compare him to our own Bill Nighy ? I'm lost for words and extremely worried I have lost my marbles and found some lsd.

31 December 2022,A triumph in big and small scale storytelling,"One of my favourite films of 2022. The story is astonishingly well crafted managing to be both totally thrilling to watch on face value and also completely captivating to see the bigger themes unfold. A multi generation chinese-American family are struggling with their lives and relationships and get the chance to explore alternative realities where their lives have taken very different directions. The film is a triumph of both big and small scale story telling while never feeling trivial or pretentious. It was fun and action packed, showing off mind-blowing editing and filming techniques as well as spectacular martial arts amongst some truly surreal ideas. The ambition and expansiveness of this film is huge and somehow expertly woven together into something that not only makes sense but is a real wonder to behold. There is also a really powerful emotional core to the film, particularly with the mother daughter relationship as well as proper laugh out loud comedy moments. The cast do an incredible job with so much to do and multiple characters to play and I hope Oscar nominations are on the horizon.

16 February 2023,"Wacky, Funny, Touching, and Smart","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

10 April 2023,I made an account to give this 10/10,"I have been using IMDb for 5 years and never reviewed any movie, but this movie made me sign up.

It was 10/10 acting, 10/10 sound and music, 100/10 visuals and without a doubt 1000/10 story.

You can feel the urge to understand the different perspectives and site with the characters. Besides from that, the progress of understanding and seeing the characters develop a understanding for each other was so fulfilling. The whole ""plot"" of the movie was a real story telling, that unfortunately many people need to be told. Some true and valuable ""how to raise"" lessons was given, and I will take them with me.

It's without a doubt 10/10.

24 October 2022,My favorite movie,"I watch at least 200 movies a year, and this is by far my favorite movie of all time. No other movie has made me laugh, cry, and wonder how A24 could make a movie this fantastic. It's so ridiculous and impressive how I could feel so much for a story with a literal everything bagel in it. The cast was perfect, Jamie lee Curtis is a fantastic supporting actor and the leads are amazing. This movie has some of the greatest and most creative action sequences I've ever seen and it deserves a lot more recognition. This movie is in my opinion the great movie of 2022 and is a must watch for anyone that enjoys movies.

2 December 2022,Family drama with universe story,"A Chinese immigrant finds himself experiencing adventurers he cannot avoid and imagine, traveling to another universe that has a different storyline of life to himself.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film that really features a story with a universe feel (this is because it is screened close to the Doctor Strange film). Everything Everywhere All at Once presents a family drama story wrapped in a fictional story of the journey of the universe. The family drama that was brought is a story related to how the life of a Chinese immigrant in the face of changes and cultural differences in the culture in which he lives. The plot of the story actually has a simple story. However, it is wrapped in such an intricate adventure. The conflict that occurs is also a family conflict that is being hit by a period of disharmony and lack of happiness. That's the point made in this film. This film wants to bring us to experience the conflict that occurs with some questions if only. With the depiction of the reality of life branching out becomes an affirmation to understand the conflict felt by the Mother in seeing her family's problems.

Everything Everywhere All at Once has a unique story. This film presents an adventure film with a combination of drama and comedy which becomes a unity of films that are fun and fun to watch. This film also does not forget to present good visual effects. The image of the formed universe appears with colorful and diverse visuals. The Cast lineup also has a nice charm. Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu performed amazingly and well.",10

30 December 2022,A wonderful and funny film that explores every possibility/outcome,"Going into this movie I had no idea what to expect at all. I mean sure, from the description of the movie I was kind of expecting chaos but what I got was chaos and then some... This movie was indeed Everywhere All at Once.

I honestly loved it. I thought it would just be a plain old boring run of the mill time/dimension story but it turned out much MUCH better than I expected. The comedy was on point, the acting was superb, the plot was very intriguing and fun. I mean what was there not to love about this? Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert did a wonderful job directing this movie.

And usually with these type of movies, the ending is always open for interpretation and left very open but I thought ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" did a perfect job wrapping it all up in a nice little box leaving us with a very satisfying ending.

16 September 2022,"Magnificient, Insipiring, Tender, Daring, Fun... All at Once","First off, this is my first IMDB review. I've wondered many times when would I finally publish one but I always felt the movies spoke for themselves, and also that there are so many people around the world reviewing here that it would simply be 'a waste of time'. Not for this movie, it isn't.

Second of all, I am a fan of old school cinema, even though I enjoy a modern flick from time to time. However, in recent years I don't think I watched anything that really moved me or made me care. That means when I actually watch something beyond the year 2000, I go in with extremely low expectations, basically that I will be watching trash. I would definitely describe myself as a pretentious viewer, meaning I really need substance in a movie to really like it.

Third, this movie inspired me to a degree I literally feel I am just a bit better as a person after watching it. So this is more of a praise than an actual review. I won't go into detail about any facet of the movie; just go watch it. What I want to share is the overall impact it had on my as a viewer. So here it goes:

My first impression was basically boredom. I didn't really understand what the writers were getting at; it this a comedy, a superhero flick, or what? All I knew going in was the movie is supposed to be 'great'. The movie starts out slow, which in hindsight is good - the pacing is on point as the viewer is slowly eased into the characters and story. I don't watch trailers, so if you're like me, you're lucky to watch this not knowing what a wild ride you are in for. The whole 'multiverse' concept is simple, yet overused these days and I was very, very disappointed with how it was handled in, say, Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness (yep, truly maddening plotholes and zero logic in that one). It's also not so easy to pull off the visuals, SFX and the whole narrative around that sort of thing. However, in EEAaO, it's handled brilliantly, in my opinion. Without taking themselves or the movie too seriously, the writers and the director manage to masterfully engage you in an almost real-life scenario where endless possibilities exist. Most, if not all of the visuals are breathtaking and mesmerising, taking full advantage of the multiverse concept inside the confines of the story, without exaggerating too much or keeping it too low-key for such an ambitious idea. The kung-fu elements I felt where spot on, not relying on 'magic' or 'superpowers' (even though we get a taste of that too, at one point).

Smart and grown-up humour is all over the place too, adding a lighter tone yet not sacrificing the overall atmosphere which is still serious enough to get one thinking and feeling more deeply. The humour itself is definitely a breath of fresh air - it's weird and at times - even kinky, but it does not cross the line too much, it's just enough to be different and really funny at the same time. It's adult aspects are not hard to draw parallels to, say, Deadpool type humour, but of course Deadpool's is way over the top, which is a sort of trademark there, but not here, thankfully.

Speaking of depth, I felt this movie is not brilliant or profound, but still manages to pull intellectual and emotional strings enough to intrigue all types of audiences. It has everything for everyone (pun not intended), from teenagers to grownups, from the casual viewer who seeks only spectacle to the more refined one that needs a bit of flare and meaning in every scene. The overall message is so sweet and simple it can appeal to anyone - perhaps only the people looking for completely empty films would not understand or care what the movie is really about - which I feel is Love, Compassion, Connection.

Trying to dig a little deeper, in a world where metaphysics and now even science are bringing us ever closer to the idea of multiple, perhaps infinite universes and alternative dimensions, quantum fields and so forth, it's a really intriguing and interesting topic with a fresh spin to it. It also has very valid moral questions inserted into that, again, in a world where definitive moral and even existential values seem to be blurring more and more.

Now, about some key elements of the movie - plot (script), direction, dialogue, acting, Action/SFX, sound/music:



Overall judgement - this movie left me feeling inspired, refreshed, and most of all - entertained. I find all this to be rare in recent productions. The movie is certainly not perfect, but I think it's really close to perfection for it's genre and the message I felt it tries to convey. In a few words - go see it if you already didn't, it's worth every minute!!",10
10 April 2022,The Tale of the Absurd Hero,"Beautiful movie that combines comedy, absurdism, mind-bending moments, growth, love, and meaning. One of my favorite movies of all time; A24 has done it again!

The 2h19m run time is just too short. Or maybe it is just perfect?

Just watch it!

15 February 2023,Entertaining but overrated,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"", directed by the Daniels duo (they're both named Daniel get it?) is an interesting, if messy experiment that starts out promising but turns into a convoluted mess.

Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) runs a laundromat with her husband Waymond (an excellent Ke Huy Quan) and has a distant relationship with her ironically named daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). They are about to be audited by an IRS agent (a saucy Jamie Lee Curtis) when all of the characters seemingly enter a nonsensical ""multiverse"".

The first 20 minutes are so solidly written and acted that I wonder what the final result would have been had if just abandoned the absurdist concept and presented a straightforward narrative instead. Of course, that's not what this filmmakers are trying to do, but at 140 minutes it wears it welcome quickly.

While I do admire the film for it's originality, it becomes so entrenched in its own over the top silliness you almost wonder what the point of any of this is.",8
22 August 2022,"A fun, touching unexpected ride","I usually write these reviews the day I see the movie on Instagram. So I'm just going to repost it here.

I usually write these from the parking lot of the theater right after I see the movie. With this film I needed time to digest everything.........cause its a lot. On the drive home I was deep in thought wondering how I was going to write this.

First some background. Before Wednesday this week I didn't even know this film existed. I didn't see any trailers, I didn't know what it was about, I didn't even know who starred in it. I went into this movie COMPLETELY blind. A dude I work with invited me out to see it. (Thanks man)

#EverythingEverywhereallatOnce is the story of Evelyn, an over worked wife and mother who runs a failing Laundromat, while taking care of her elderly Father. Her life takes a sudden dramatic and unexpected (in every sense of the word) turn when while at the tax office she is contacted by her husband from an alternate universe.

This movie is Bonkers, balls to the wall insane, 0 to 100 in a millisecond, turned up to 11 crazy ride. It has the feel of a #EdgarWright film in some parts a Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor film in others with some #WesAnderson sprinkled in. This movie is Hilarious, irreverent, touching, insane, hopeful, gross, confusing, and moving, throughout.

The performances from the Actors were all top notch most notably #MichelleYeoh, #KeHuyQuan and #StephanieHsu. I've never seen Michelle Yeoh in a film like this before and its so cool to see that she's still got it. Ke Huy Quan's character is easily my favourite of the three. The heart of this movie. It was also cool see #JamieLeeCurtis on screen again this time as a minor villan. Last movie I saw her in was #KnivesOut. Great performances all around.

While the story is hard to follow at first, and the transitions are very quick and jarring I have no problem recommending this movie. Its an gem of a film and I'm glad I got to see it. I enjoyed watching this and had a ton of fun. Movies like this remind me of why I like watching movies in the first place. High praises all around.",10
1 October 2022,A Masterpiece,"This movie is like nothing you've ever seen before, but it's amazing. It's hilarious, it's awesome, and it made me cry. It is not a simple story, and it takes some patience, but this is the kind of storytelling that is truly masterful. To take all of these parts and weave them into such a compelling whole is so impressive. Before I watched it I thought, ""140 minutes, really?"" And 30 minutes in, honestly I was a bit bored. But I stuck with it, and when I finished I was basically just in shock. Like holy crap, I can't believe how much I enjoyed that insane ride.

It may not be for everyone, but from story, to acting, to score, to editing, it's just so well done. Whether or not you enjoy it, you have to at least admire it.

10 July 2023,Thank you to everyone who took part in creating this film,"At the end of the day this is a simple and beautiful story about a mother and daughter in a divided, struggling relationship struggling trying to understand one another and failing resulting in their entire world falling apart (both figuratively and literally). The message and self-gratifying feeling this films delivers to its viewers has profoundly touched me, I loved every moment of it. Relationships in immigrant families especially with one's mother, even if filled with intentions of love and protection can be difficult and what a beautiful and unique way to tell it, even if I don't think one would will reallly ever understand or full accept the other at least not in our reality.

Analysis hat, on whats sets it apart is its ability to blend genres, were all now more than ever aware of the multiverse (in films, of course!) so the concept easy enough to grasp, but it allowed it brought a certain originality to this film that probably wont be replicable elsewhere, so a lot of people might called this a gimmick film I mean it certainly won't spawn any sequels or prequels or it's own original genre but I mean who even whats that am I right?

TL;DR",10
19 February 2023,Not out of good ideas just yet...,"In the bevy of remakes, and remixes and sequels Hollywood pops out, there are still diamonds in that rough.

This movie is in everyway an absolute diamond. It is a brilliant story of finding the shine in an ordinary life. And yet, it's told in a way that is visually engaging and so original, you almost forget what the point was.

It's funny, it's weird, it's heartful, it's serious, it's amazing in that it strikes so many chords, and makes them all sing so wonderfully together. The casting, the script, and the performances simply make this a must watch for anyone dying to find something original to see.

15 April 2022,As weird as mainstream film can get,"It may be a bad idea to do a brief review of a movie this nuanced and deep, but I'll give it a shot.

This Sci-Fi Comedy takes you on a journey of a Chinese family in America, jumping between alternate realities and timelines. Ke Huy Quan's character calls upon Michelle Yeoh's character to save the multiverse by defeating a dimension-hopping being hunting her down and attempting to destroy all of reality. Michelle's character might defeat this being by jumping between parallel realities - becoming different versions of herself in different timelines. And that's just the setup.

The first thing you'll notice is that this movie is filled with lovable actors playing endearing characters. Michelle and James Hong are legends of the screen and effortlessly pull off their action, comedy, and dramatic sequences. Ke Huy (the Asian kid, now adult, from The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) oozes kindness and charm. Jamie Lee Curtis also brings her experience to this movie as her presence is always both ridiculous and intimidating throughout.

This is significant because these actors play at least 5 - 10 different characters in the movie, spanning every mainstream Hollywood genre. There were artistic liberties in some of these alternate dimensions Michelle goes into. I wish this fictional world had more rules so it isn't just ""Anything can happen, so let's throw up whatever we want on the screen!"". It's fun but also seemingly art for art's sake.

The real story is a family drama caught up in this dimension-hopping chaos. There is meaning in pondering what could have been if you had only made different choices earlier in life. This movie challenges you with accepting the choices you've made up to this point and enjoy your current life despite the mistakes you think you've made. Michelle's character is faced with this challenge multiple times, and it's truly a wonder to watch.

Enjoy the acting, the colorful visuals, the action, the comedy, and the philosophical and thought-provoking dialogue all at once. Or not. This isn't your all too familiar genre film. But I'll thoroughly enjoy watching all the awards this movie will inevitably get.",9
18 March 2023,Suspiciously overrated.,"I watched the movie with high hopes, because of the after Oscar's publicity. I hate to tell you, but I do not see the Oscar's in this movie. I do not see the excellent acting. Or the brilliant script. The storyline is very vague and most of the time you do not understand what are the dialogues about. Apart from few photographically nice scenes, the whole movie is just absurd, like a bad joke. Do not see the art, neither the blockbuster. Even the action scenes are long and a bit dull. I would define not remember it tomorrow, and I would definitely not suggest it to anyone else. Overall, I am happy I saw it for free..

18 March 2023,This film was truly mind blowing!,"This film was so visually stunning. The way they used lighting was phenomenal, the interchanging of lights shining on Evelyn as she looks at Waymond, showing her love is so cleverly done as well as giving you so much to think about in a film.

The way they balanced family, love, making the film gritty, using Kung Fu, bringing tears to my eyes and making me laugh out loud is something I've never seen attempted in a film. This is the true representation of 'Everything' and it works.

I loved how you could see Michelle Yeoh, really play the role of her character, Evelyn. Seeing all her thought processes. Starting off confused and slowly turning into a badass Kung Fu queen.

""I don't know... the only thing I do know... is that we have to be kind"" and ""Especially if we don't know what's going on"" the way Key Huy Quan, Waymond, presents this line is so touching because it's true. With all this violence in this world today we are so quick to judge people who are confused, and don't know what they're doing that we forget to 'be kind' and patient with them.

I have a very short attention span so this film was perfect. Everything was fast paced and so bright and flashy that it forced me to stay engaged plus I wanted to so I didn't miss anything. This film was truly mind blowing.",10
15 May 2022,Just be a rock,"The movie at times feels like it is written by 12 year olds that have taken the pills from limitless and have unlocked 100% of their brain. The whacky, strange beauty of this movie means the more and more you try and work out where you are narratively, the further away from the truth you'll find yourself. As the film states, you have to just be a rock and observe as it works its multiversal magic. Everything everywhere all at once is bombastic, beautiful and surgical in its precision, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you question if you are the best or worst version of yourself in the vast multiverse of possibility. 10 stars. End of.

6 February 2023,Must see movie - but there will be many who miss the detail,"Stunning movie but many details will be overlooked...carefully detailed underlying messages. Googling eyes and character names add to the obvious but also layered themes. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, scripting, characters and acting. This is visually entertaining...comedic but also theological - pulling together quantum theory and spirituality. Everything everywhere at once is a display of balance in action. Duality in depth....wrapped in a bit of silly to make it easily digestible. Another clever aspect was the use of subtitles and language...for most viewers that draws your attention. You cannot be distracted- you need to pay attention. Thoroughly recommended viewing - best movie to come out in decades - iI consider it to be must view...

18 April 2022,"This movie is about the ""human"" in HUMANITY!","This is the most amazing movie I've ever seen. Parallel lives, parallel universes collide in this family story filled with love, hate, shame, laughter, regret, karma and enlightenment. All these emotions in one beautiful film.

17 July 2022,This Unbearable Campiness of Being,"From the technical perspective, the techniques used to achieve the moving pictures we get to see on screen, CGI or practical, are all commendable. Now let's talk about the finished product.

The entire concept of a ""multiverse"" is open to interpretation. This is due to the fact that no one has ever ventured out of our universe if indeed this could be done. If there are infinite version of ourselves then surely nothing is impossible. Our creative minds may not even be capable of imagining all the possible versions of ourselves in existence. It's hard to wrap our brains around the concept itself to begin with. So when asked ""What version of yourself, of our world, do you think is out there?"", there are no wrong answers. All we need is an open mind.

An open mind is what I had when I sat down watch this film. I was open to accept the version of the multiverse this movie has to offer. There is, after all, no wrong answers. No wrong versions.

Then what is supposed to be a mindbogglingly vast and infinite multiverse has been reduced and forced to play inside a dimly lit, stuffy, cluttered, and claustrophobic little stage where a number of casts and characters are all trying to be significant and profound all at the same time. I tried my very best to keep an open mind, just be at awe of this supposed magnificent achievement in film making.

Then lesbians with sausage fingers and talking rocks says I'm taking myself way too seriously.",2
18 April 2022,Don't learn anything just go see it.,"Michelle Yeoh is fantastic, the writing and action sequences are great and it feels like.a movie. Something to be seen in around two hours in a theatre and to be experienced in this format. A great mix of funny, poignant and dramatic with a satisfying conclusion.

29 May 2022,What a great movie!,"I see it goes over some people's heads, don't let that scare you. If you like intelligent funny movies then this movie is for you! The cast is just amazing the story is interesting and weird. Where Cloud Atlas was about reincarnation and taking itself seriously, this movie is about multiverses and not taking itself seriously. I wish there were more movies like this!

30 September 2022,Every feeling everywhere all at once,"I don't get why people who watched the film for 20-45 minutes can come here and claim it was an unfunny, boring and chaotic movie and people shouldn't watch it.

You should watch it, I believe this is a masterpiece that will change how we see things, how we see each other, and most of all, how we see ourselves.

I can agree that the first half hour was a bit confusing, but after a while I began to see the connection, the emotions, the harsh reality of how this was so close to my own home. And once I got all of that, I saw a beautiful cinematic piece unfold into an incredible storyline. You must embrace the chaos to get the chaos.

So please watch until the very end, you'll like it. And you'll get it.

1 April 2023,America hits bottom,"When such things are not only possible but moreover applauded and awarded, then you know something is really wrong. Not like the Vietnam years when actors would come and protest the war, but rather like the late '40s this dark era when a sword was suspended upon anyone's neck who would dare dissent. Of course censorship has many faces, and is best served when it lies inside people's hearts. America steadily tumbles in a long protracted decline. It is not just the wrong people, it is the institutions that are corrupted to the core. The day has come when we can see the '90s as a golden era compared to what has followed. Hypocrisy makes us proud to export democracy and human rights around the world while there is a crisis inside and when no one outside finds us convincing and truly committed any more.

14 April 2023,A truly Wonderful Comedy Movie,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is as the title already says a truly wonderful comedy Movie. Not only are the characters amazingly written, the cgi (that was made by the driector who just learned it btw) was on another level and the story just beautiful and deep. The Ending was also very interesting, because it let the viewers question, if everything that they just have seen actually happned or just a visualization of their situation was (I don't want to spoil anything so that might have been kinda weird written). The only point that I think wasn't perfect in this sense was the usage of the villain. The villain was way too soon revealed and with that took the mysterious flare that the movie had been building up at the start. Besides that, I really enjoyed watching this movie with my family and we all had something to laugh because of how incredible stupid (the actions in there not how they were made) some scenes were. The depth that the movie has been building up was also very promising to me and it left a truly emotional impact on me and my family.

9/10 A must watch!",9
15 April 2022,Matrix meets David Lynch,"My gosh words cannot express how flipping awesome this movie is!

And the dad is super cute I am crushing.

It also deals with mental illness in a really good way.

Highly recommend!

31 January 2023,This is a very fun movie,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",8

1 November 2022,"A Masterpiece, breath of fresh air","Einstein illustrated relativity with an example of a hot stove and that special girl.

In 2022, this concept is probably best illustrated by the comparison sitting through one agonizing episode of She-Hulk that factually lasts somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes but feels like an eternity that you are forcing yourself through.

And then there's this original movie that's not based on a franchise, objectively lasts 2h 19m and feels like it's barely been more than an hour after you're done.

And yet this movie didn't leave me desperate for more. I think this movie has accomplished a very rare feat, especially in the current day and age: Finding the perfect length for the story it is telling.

I'm for sure going to rewatch this movie many times, it's just such a joy ride and yet it managed to bring tears to my eyes. It's deeply meaningful and absolutely silly. It's original and raw, wild and meticulously crafted. It's literally everything everywhere all at once. Well, except for boring or predictable.

Best film of 2022, and it's not even close. This film deserves nothing less than Academy Awards for best picture and best original screenplay.",9
20 March 2023,Rock Scene & Raccacoonie,"Great movie that doesn't fit the predictable mold the movie industry tends to stick with when profit and mass appeal is the main focus. Does take some attention to stick to the story line which had me engaged at the theaters but when watching at home you can pause and rewind to fully absorb more of the details. The rock scene and raccacoonie were hits for me.

Seems like post Oscars lot's of criticism about the movie being overhyped, people are not actually enjoying the movie or appreciating it for what it is but only in comparison to others in the lineup that made them feel some way or another. Regardless of what awards this movie has won I would suggest taking yourself out of what the narrative you hear say and just go along for the ride.

The whole movie was awesome. The acting, the story, the production and the cast were just perfect.

The whole movie was like an acid trip for me. Slowly building up and feeling amazing after a while and finally coming down slowly.

It was just this perfect thing. I just made an account so I can rate this movie. Highly recommended.

16 November 2022,Sliding Leap,"I have high expectations about this movie and certainly it was quite a ride. This film is like ""Sliders"" meets ""Quantum Leap"" with a touch of ""The Matrix"". It's an exciting experiment where you can find almost any main movie genre along the story. Where action and sci-fi are key genres but it's family drama what makes this film something outstanding and truly unique. A great performing cast merging Asian talent with American in the front of the big screen showing a balance with the work behind the scenes where East meets West as well. Definitely, I have no doubt that this is one of the best ten films of 2022.

21 January 2023,Absolutely amazing,"I haven't been so surprised by a movie in a long time. Went in expecting some silly alternative dimension fun and got presented with a masterpiece. I genuinely did not know what to expect half of the time, that's something you can rarely say about movies anymore. I laughed and cried. ( Never in my life imagined I so idk be bawling because of some rocks). The cinematography is also beautiful, as are the amazing costumes. The actors performance is great and moving. This movie means a lot to me and comforted me in a time where I was uncertain about my life. This movie is going on my comfort movie list for sure. If you struggle in your life I really recommend you to watch this movie it puts things into perspective and leaves you with a beautiful warm feeling for days on end.

25 March 2023,Honestly - this was a terrible movie,"How did this get seven Oscars? I can understand the Oscar for best supporting actor because his performance was genuine, and sweet, and kind, and je does hold this mess of a film together. But the rest of this movie is one of the hardest to watch dumbest movies ever made. Some family moves through a zillion lifetimes in some strange eternal conflict with one another to stop a bagel and a tax collector with hotdog fingers? The film never stops to develop any of the characters and the action just repeats over and over and isn't even very good. The martial arts isn't even very good. Truly a weird almost unwatchable stupid movie.

14 August 2022,Never knew SciFi could take such a 'familiar' turn,"This movie has been hailed as a redefinition of the sci-fi genre, a masterfully crafted family drama, a visual eye candy, and all I can say is that this movie goes beyond these reviews. The cinematography is perfect, the score is lovely, the actors are at their best, and the theme makes this a mind bending, but wholesome family watch. This movie is a reminder for us to be kind, to be understanding and caring, and to be open to new possibilities. In today's environment, this message, which is beautifully and subtly (maybe not subtly) portrayed in this film, is crucial. Easily one of the best movies of the year.

20 May 2022,it's an everything bagel..,"... cause there's pretty much a bit of everything. Everything Everywhere All At Once is a genre-bending multiverse film, it's a non-stop action, comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi, thriller and a little bit of romance. It's the kind of film that you're not really sure how describe it to your friends when they asks what it's about. It's definitely a fresh, eccentric out of the box film of its genre.

It has decent story and very well acted but what strike my attention is the visual. It's definitely has the most extravagantly colorful striking cinematography and editing. Especially with the little budget they had (from what i heard cmiiw). It's definitely a strong OSCAR contender.

But with all that being said, with all these overtly colorful strong visual and heavy drama, at times it feels a bit too...much(?) Don't get me wrong, it's still an extremely well made film, but it feels a bit overwhelming to watch, even with only 2hr19min runtime.

Anyway, definitely a must watch.

12 March 2023,Hope: A Lesson on how Hope...,"Let's be real, this movie ain't for everyone, and I get that. When I saw it with my family, I'd say 2/3's of us liked it, with my father being the biggest detractor. And to those of you out there who are realists in life, content with where things are for you, and just the quiet type of easy-going person that just rolls through life, than you can stop reading this review right here.

To everyone else, keep reading, I promise you'll be happy you did.

If like me, you aren't perfect, than sit down, turn your TV on, and give it a go. It starts off hectic, the first ten minutes are a whirlwind, and it keeps going. There are hints of something more until the twenty minute mark of so when stuff starts for real.

The first act is decently linear, a typical movie in many ways, but also does more to mess with your mind than almost any other film. For the casual viewer, you might think that it can't get any more crazy than this. It's somewhat depressing, but it's so fun to watch, as it keeps you on your toes at all times.

Than the act titled ""Everywhere"" starts, and in my view, this is truly where the film hits it's stride. It takes you on an emotional ride for the next hour, up and down, everything you could possibly feel rushing through you at all times. I was glued to the screen, and quite frankly I loved almost every second of it. Yeah sure, there are some little parts that are kinda stupid, some parts that are a little too much. But then, there are others that you thought were crazy, and they turn out to teach you something profound about life.

When the credits hit me, I learnt something about myself, I felt a feeling that I hadn't felt in ages... Hope. Sure, I'd felt hopeful, or excited, or absolutely lit at parties or practice whatnot, but I hadn't felt a real sense of hope in so long, a real sense of happiness in so long. It's liberating in a way to feel that, to realize that maybe you did get it all wrong, to realize that maybe there is more out there than what you'd expected life was gonna hand you.

Maybe my movie has just entered it's third act, or at least my personal journey of acceptance has done so, I can't really decide, but I do know this. Most things might not matter, but some things do, and that's what gives you hope in life, it's what gives me hope. While you may return to your point of normalcy later down the line, your ""hedonic set point,"" the knowledge that your life can reach a sense of fulfillment is what drives you along.

This movie didn't give me that fulfillment, but it did make me realize that it's still possible, and it gave me...

Hope.",10
12 March 2023,Profound wisdom in an art form.,"Very few titles have done justice to the theme of interconnectedness i.e., how everything is connected across time and space.

On a spectrum of complexity let's start with the simplest one first. Bullet Train, which is all about how lives of a few individuals in a city culminates and in the end comes together. Then comes Babel - an interlocking story about one single event and its impact on four families living across different countries. Third is Life Itself which is about the cumulative impact on two families spread over two generations and two continents. Most complex of all is Cloud Atlas. This one took it to another level and showed how the action of one individual life impacts one another in the past, present and future. All these titles have tried to explain that nothing is random and there are no coincidences.

But Everything Everywhere All at Once has done what all these titles plus a few others (put together) could not.

Everything: If you end up scratching your head after watching this movie, the title says it all. ""Everything"". Everything is The theory of the Infinite on a Cosmic Scale. That's exactly what Stephen Hawking has tried to tell us with his Magnum Opus ""The Theory of Everything"". Alice in Wonderland, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Matrix, The Bhagavad Gita (the inner battle of Good vs Evil), The beginning & conflagration of cosmos, The Big Bang, Black Holes explained in term of Bagels, giant stars giving birth to elements and the subsequent evolution of life on Earth, reincarnations, debate on Atoms and Randomness vs Faith & Providence, Free-will vs Destiny. Phew! Simply put, everything about the Universe (which incidentally contains almost everything). And not just that also infinity and beyond - The Multiverse. All this is just too much to take in a span of a couple of hours.

Everywhere: And if everything wasn't too much to take in, in comes Everywhere. This is the theory of the sub-atomic - the infinitely small world of Particles. The Strange world of the Subatomic which is governed by a madhouse set of physical laws known as quantum mechanic. Here it is possible for a sub atomic particle like electron to be in two locations at the same - Quantum Superimposition.

All at Once: Everything Everywhere All at Once equals complexity raised to the power infinity. But that complexity, if seen differently is merely on a surface level. What it all boils down to is the present moment we all have and the choices we all make in the here and now. Simply put love is a ""choice"" we call can make in every moment and this has a profound impact on both here and now and also infinity which some call it as ""destiny"". If that sounded heavy, read the ancient Hindu Scriptures, the Abrahamic Religions, Greco Roman Philosophy & Persian Mysticism and you will get the same eternal message which has stood the test of time and space.

All is One. Love All.

Peace.",9
15 January 2023,Extremely overrated and exaggerated,"I wanted to like this film. It has a cool concept that if well executed could've been a masterpiece. This gilm however was an epic waste of time for me. My gf loves it and introduced it to me and it was a torture to sit and watch more than 2 hours of a story that is full of absurdity and overly exaggerated executed ideas. It felt like a 10h movie that would never end. With the exception of a few good lines and deep ideas, watching this was a total wasted time and torture. There are tons of other movies that will be deeper without having to look like it was written by someone under the influence of drugs.

20 May 2022,"Holy Hole in a Donut, Batman!","This is a hyper-magical postmodern fable, akin in style to the most recent Marvel multiverse schlockfests, but with more heart and a lot more hilarity. You're most likely to enjoy this if you are already comfortable with jarring technicolor visuals, haphazard editing sequences, unlikable characters, loose ends, inexplicable chaos, etc.. this film exhibits a potpourri of sweet, sweet mania rarely seen in the cinema. Highly recommended for fans of the following: The Wave (2019), The Fall (2006), Paprika (2006), Adaptation (2002), Holy Motors (2012), or Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (2010)... ok be safe out there, I love you, see you later!

Everyone, everywhere all at once should see the movie. The cast alone is worth the ticket. Michele, Jamie Lee and co do a great job. And the outtakes on the Blu-ray edition makes things funnier, nice touch.

7 September 2023,"Bonkers, charming and hilarious","This film was bonkers! But very good. Michelle Yeo plays Evelyn Wang, and hard working but disorganised owner of a laundromat with her husband, Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). Their as-good-as estranged daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu) is struggling to deal with teenage girl emotions while having a white girlfriend and their parents' disdain of this. So basically a happy family film accept Evelyn is the key to the survival of the entire multiverse.

The best place to start is the acting, for which a have to give 10/10. Kudos to Sarah Finn as she superbly fuses elite Chinese actors with American Hollywood. I'll get to the main cast later, but my god Jamie Lee Curtis was exceptional. Playing a double entendre role, she provides hilarity, menace, authority and ferocity, all one one scene alone! She plays the tax auditor who threatens to close down the beloved laundromat, while playing a key role in the wider multiverse as well.

James Hong looked like he was having a lot of fun as the traditional, hard-nosed Chinese father who is old and disappointed in his daughter. He is allowed by director David Kwan to show a more youthful side to him as well.

But the whole film comes down to the holy trinity: Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu. The chemistry between them is electric, and they are able to effectively convey the struggles of immigrants coming over to make a living in the US, while trying to maintain being a family. Michelle Yeoh's Evelyn is the driving force behind the family, and shows her full array of talents, from excellent fighting skills to being a hilariously snappy mother, while having the weight the task she is facing. Quan is just so adorable. It is heartbreaking to see how innocent and puppy like he is, also being able to flex his martial arts. The standout for me however was Hsu's Joy, an ironic name considering you see her smile maybe 3 times (twice in an evil grin). Growing up with a failing mother, unaccepting grandfather, a useless father, AND being a gay Chinese girl, AND THEN being the literal centre of the multiverse, she is phenomenal. Raw, emotional, sassy and evil, she also shows that this is a front for the deep sadness she feels after all the circumstances I have just mentioned.

The direction of this film was 10/10 as they jump from filming style to filming style, with clear and obvious influences from the classic martial arts films to Groundhog Day, without it being overbearing. The interplay between each universe is unbelievable, and some of the characters are unparalleled (they manage to make two rocks poignant!).

I think it very slightly got lost in its confusion, but the underlying message of an appreciation of family and those who matter most, while bombarding you with hot dog fingers, dildos and Raccoonatouille makes this whacky, charming, hilarious and wholesome.",8
26 June 2022,Love it,"I love it, some actions or decisions are just like collision of Mars and Earth, same as the encounter between me and you. Nothing matters means NOTHING matters, to love is to embrace the NOTHING, embrace the chaos. Novalis said that we may never understand each other(just like the mother-daughter in this film), but we can go futher more than just understanding each other, it happens only when we are in a decisive moment, where nothing matters.

By the way, the settings of the multiuniverse are better than that of Doctor Strange 2, the former makes me feel the director being high.

But I dont like the ending, the reconciliation of this east asia family seems too simple for me. It gives me a feeling of just covering up the contradictions, not solving them.

It seems like an orchestra of 1000 different instruments all improvising at the same time, but somehow through an amazing script, wonderful acting and Oscar-worthy virtuoso directing makes a coherent, original piece of Art.

It is a parable, it uses humorous and ridicule to comment on the most important life's aspects.

12 June 2023,For 10 year olds. Puerile drivel.,"EEAAO is the worst movie ever to win Oscars, 7 in all and none of them deserved.

In whose mind was it Best anything? I stuck with it until about 20 minutes from the end simply because it had won these awards and I still don't understand why. There was no story the viewer could follow other than some woke nonsense about being 'kind'. The acting showed no finesse because the actors had no intelligible lines to work with. There's a silly premise of a middle aged woman being able to jump about between different universes while she's in the throes of a divorce and doing her business tax returns.

Anyone over the age of 16 may well be praying for the end as I was, although I never got quite that far before jumping ship.

To show some balance here, the only other film I've seen in this year's Oscar race, is the far superior ""Women Talking"". I would challenge any of the performances in that film against Michelle Yeoh and company. EEAAO is in short, a car crash in terms of good film making and I really despair now of the Oscars if rubbish like this win. What is wrong with voters? Did they get their kids to vote in their place?",1
23 February 2023,The Better Multiverse Film?!,"The characters are EVERYTHING!

The plot is EVERYWHERE!

As it happens ALL AT ONCE!

The main lead actress, Michelle Yeoh, steals the entire show, perhaps being my favorite role she's ever done right along side ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", with a great supporting cast that at some points in the film, they take center stage along with Yeoh.

Speaking of supporting cast, Ke Huy Quan absolutely dominated with the screentime he was given and a wonderful and emotional triumph return, from ""Indiana Jones"" and ""The Goonies"" to a now Oscar Nominated feature film.

As this being a story about the multiverse, it succeeded far greater than ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"". Which was overall a missed opportunity and a disappointment. The film brought more and clear understanding about the concept of the multiverse instead of complicating things to connect with a broader and wider universe like the MCU. The film also stands out more from other versions and takes of the concept of the multiverse due to its standalone nature and its own take on how the structure of the multiverse works.

To wrap this up, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is an achievement in filmmaking from its cast of characters , story and its many themes and connections to the real world, to the shear insanity of weirdness that it gives, only to keep it contained, only pushing the boundaries when it needs to.

This is a MUST see for movie fans.

One of my favorite films of last year.",10
17 May 2022,Don't listen to the bad reviews!!!,"Just made an account only to say the people giving bad reviews are weird old people caught up politicizing or overthinking the whole thing. Definitely one of the best movies EVER, almost undeniably destined to becoming a classic. Go see this movie so you can brag to people you saw it when it first came out!

15 July 2023,Great movie without a doubt (for me),"I watched this movie, I liked it very much as you can guess by the 10/10, and I am sad to see people giving it negative reviews so I read some of them and summarized what most of the hate for the movie is about:

Most of the haters agree that the movie is creative, but seem to dislike the length and the beginning of the movie. The main reason is the old styled introduction that requires patience for the story to kick in. The time it takes to introduce the setting might seem a bit long for young or unprepared audiences but I don't think it would be a problem for patient people. The waiting in the beginning pays of greatly throughout the movie, especially to those patient enough to listen to the characters and dive into the story in the time given to them. I also noticed some people being mislead into thinking of it as a comedy movie, they were unsatisfied with it for not being funny, but luckily, they seem to be a minority. And the plot is coming next, people seem to miss the plot of the movie, which is understandable considering how complicated it is. The way multiverses were induced in the story is just perfect, I heard that this movie's idea for multiverses came from ""Spider man: Into The Spider Verse"" movie, but it is a misleading statement because this movie uses multiverses as a plot and art device much better than the Spider Man movie. In any case, the plot is very hard to follow for that exact reason, and that is why people didn't like the storytelling in my opinion, they just seem to miss the depth of the story. But that is only a problem for those who can't follow it's plot, because the plot itself is just perfect, I just can't explain how good the story is. The last one is the art, it's probably the best part of the movie, the way it ties to the plot, the abstract images, the different settings for each universe, SPOILERS FOR THE NEXT SENTENCE: I totally forgot the movie was taking it's place in a single building for the whole movie.

END OF SPOILERS watching it made me feel as if I visited each of those universes, they are memorable, interesting, each in it's own way. I am amazed at how the art represented such a bizarre idea for a plot, and excelled in it.

In conclusion, despite the movie clearly not being made for everyone, it has no flaws when it comes to writing and filming. The movie might not be as engaging at the beginning, but the moment it pulls you in will stay with you forever. Or in case these type of movies are not for you, you will never get to that moment.",10
11 April 2022,Mind Bending Experience,"This movie was one of the most mind bending and original movies I've seen in a long time. The music, cinematography, and acting were all top notch. I recommend going into this movie with as little understanding of it as you possibly can, and be open minded. This movie made me laugh, had great action, and also had an emotional core. I love that this movie wasn't afraid to not take itself too seriously, allowing itself to play around with some completely absurd concepts, and having them work perfectly. I also think it's important to go out and watch creative and original movies like this to encourage more directors to follow suit. I'll end with my only criticism of this movie, which is that it did kinda start a little slow for me. Other than that, I highly recommend everyone go see this movie.

I genuinely loved this movie and can't stop thinking about it. After only one watch, I can easily say this is one my new all-time favorites. I can't recommend it enough!

I finally woke up with an incredible feeling and it became one of the movies I will never forget.

18 June 2022,Too try-hard for me,"You know that feeling when someone starts telling you an anecdote and you think its going to be funny, but they just go on and on until eventually you switch off to, what they're saying... that's how this film was for me. I was laughing out loud for the first 20 minutes, enjoying the bizarreness of it all, then I was smiling, then just watching... after an hour I'd picked up my iPad and was checking emails, glancing up at the TV screen, where the nonsense was still trying to make me laugh. But it was just more nonsense. When ""The End"" came up, it was a relief. I know there was 50 mins+ left, but I really didn't care. Gave up and watched something else.

20 July 2023,"Innovative, Fun, Insightful Stuff","Everything Everywhere All at Once, which stars Michelle Yeoh in a superb performance, lives up to its promise of being a magnificent sensory overload that is both profoundly disorienting and intellectually captivating. The film's distinctive fusion of genres, styles, and insights creates a wholly new immersive experience that is what makes it so original. In a style that is both visually magnificent and emotionally potent, the movie deftly combines aspects of drama, fantasy, and science fiction.

Although it is never explicitly mentioned, Everything Everywhere All At Once implies that what gives life purpose is the understanding that everything and every moment has equal value because there is no inherent meaning. It's a daring cinematic reflection on all the insignificant but essential things that give us and our life significance in an uncaring cosmos.

29 July 2022,One word review: FUN!!!,"I've genuinely enjoyed watching this, I don't know when the last time I watched a movie with good directing, visuals, acting, concept, and message everything was so well put together.

I've never gone deep into characters, themes, or hidden messages of movies because I've no knowledge in that department, But I'll try to do it for this one because I have a feeling there is a lot to unpack.

5 June 2022,Good sad and goofy,"This movie is one of the best of all time. When I saw it was about the multiverse I was a little disappointed as I think that kind of movie often fails to be emotionally profound and good beyond action. This wasn't the case here. The action of this movie is levels above any other movie I've seen in the last five years. The comedy is on point and is well done so it doesn't take away from the films drama aspect while still being hilarious. All of the performances are great, especially Michelle Yeoh and Le Huy Quan. 100% would recommend.

1 July 2022,The best movie since Arrival,"Humor. Heart. Humility. Michelle Yeoh is as baddass as she is loving. I'll never look at trophies or googly eyes again. 15/10.

This movie handles the multiverse better than any Marvel film has as of yet. And with more humor through the entire ordeal. And as insane and kookoo bananas is, the movie is just about love. Loving your daughter, your husband. Love your chosen family. Love those you'd never choose. Fight with love.

5 June 2022,Worse than bad!,"I would have given this movie a minus rating had it been possible. I have seen bad movies but this one is absolutely a terrible film. This movie must have been written by a psychotic patient on LSD. There is no plot, just senseless jumping around. The main character switches roles every few seconds. Don't waste your money on this film.

7 March 2023,Profound and Creative,"This movie was incredibly creative with its multiverse timelines. I think the absurdist aspects of the film may surprise some viewers, but there is commentary to be found about contemporary society through the use of this aesthetic. Beyond the constant surprises of the film, is a much deeper reflection on existence that asks major questions about the meaning of life and relationships. I had a number of different reactions and interpretations of the film while I was watching it, but the conclusion offered deep messages about human connection. The acting was also superb and the film seemed incredibly ambitious visually. It is amazing to me that they pulled it off because it was a very complex film! In all, this film was easily one of the best of the past few years and is well worth your time.

It is significantly better than the majority of Marvel movies, that start with CGI and make a movie around it. This movie put the story first, and used CGI as needed.

1 April 2023,Not the best film of 2022 in my opinion but still a masterpiece,"I love the creative, inventive and inspiring world building of all of these different universes and it kind of takes you to these different worlds. The mother and daughter conflict is done very well and is done much better than in Turning Red. What makes this a great conflict is the fact that you can understand from both points of view. The mother is a person who wants her daughter to have a simple but good life but doesn't want to confuse her father by telling him that her daughter is a lesbian. And the daughter wants her romance to bloom and wants her mother to accept that. And this makes great conflict because you can be on both sides. Turning Red didn't do that that much. The mother is just a person who doesn't want her daughter to use the panda power so that way she doesn't embarrass herself but the daughter wants to use it because it's making people happy and she wants people to stay happy and she also wants to see a concert. In Turning Red you're more on the daughter's side than the mother's side because of her being more unlikable and pretty douchey. Here yes the mother can go a little far through insulting her daughter but it's only done at least once at the 15 minute mark of the movie. What makes this movie work for me though is the acting. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu and Jamie Lee Curtis are all fantastic but the standout for me and let's talk about the all time GOAT of the movie. Ke Huy Quan. Need I say more? Well yes. Ke Huy Quan started out well with Temple of Doom and Goonies but after those movies he hasn't had the best career. But here he gives in my opinion one of the best performances of the 21st century that I've seen. What makes this performance so perfect is mainly down to the two main elements he pulls off perfectly. One is the comedy. I love the way he portrays the quirky and goofy husband and he pulls off all of his comedic parts perfectly. The drama he also does perfectly. So much of his lines for the drama like the ""be kind"" monologue are simple yet very effective and make his performance pull it off perfectly. He's the heart of the movie and I can see why. Man, this feels like a huge comeback and it feels fantastic. I can see why this movie changed cinema simply because of it's writing, editing, directing, acting, comedy and the creativity and ingenuity in the world building. It feels like the last third of Turning Red. It takes something that is so funny and hilarious but yet perfectly transitions into something that's simple yet very powerful and emotional at the same time. A movie that I'd highly recommend.",10

28 January 2023,"The glass ceiling cracked, but...","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

11 March 2023,It's a live story,"The hype is one thing, but if you love film, this is for you. Sideways references to Kubrick and Hitchcock, wonderful cinematography sound like Zimmer. It's just excellent.

Trying to summarise it would be worthless, as the quality, depth and range of the script and acting would not be served justice.

I cannot comprehend the poor reviews of this, it is simply out of this world. It justifies everything it's been nominated for and I imagine the past masters of directing would wish this was there's.

Is it Scorsese grit, no but it possesses the speed of the Marrix with charm and wit of a Cornetto film. Watch it and walk away happy and inspired.

31 July 2022,It's Everywhere Alright,"The film Everything Everywhere All at Once is the trippiest, most confusing movie I've ever watched in my life. There is so much bouncing around, and it requires a lot of thought and attention to understand it enough to enjoy it. And those are my only real cons. It's a great movie, and it does have a pretty depressing tone with a lot of scenes having a sense of hopelessness. There is still plenty of moments with a great sense of hope, but I wouldn't recommend to those who struggle mentally. Michelle Yeoh always nails her parts, especially as disapproving mothers for some reason. It's a bizarre film with a crazy new angle for the movie industry. I wouldn't mind seeing more like this, just maybe with a happier tone. A lot of visuals are really cool but also really trippy and hard to watch. The action is also really good, and the movie is full of it. So while it's a really depressive movie, it's also a whole new crazy A24 movie with lots of new, creative things brought to the table that I wouldn't mind seeing a whole lot more of in other films.

12 September 2022,Best movie ever,"Well, I laughed, I cried, then I cried while laughing. I'm not sure how they managed to reach so many emotions, all at once (pun intended), but it definitely worked. I literally sent a message to my wife, who was travelling, after one scene where they were holding hands. I started watching this film without knowing exactly what I was getting into but was completely taken by the simplicity and complexity of this story. Every aspect of the characters serves a purpose to the story and moves the plot forward. The humour is so silly but amazingly funny. I guess funny doesn't need to be too complicated. What a masterpiece.

21 October 2022,Brilliant and great fun!,"I loved it! Gives vibes of Kurt Vonnegut/David Lynch/Thomas Pynchon. This movie has a great mix of imagination, humor, and clever dialog. It has emotional appeal, but is in no way sappy. I think the filmmakers took a lot of chances in the making of this film, which comes gives it a freewheeling, unpredictable quality.

The only criticism I have is that it was a little too long, and some scenes could have been eliminated or shortened

I'm sure that many people will not like this film, because it transgresses many of the formulas of filmmaking and its effects are low-budget and silly. Some people will simply not want to stick with it, but those who do will be rewarded.

21 March 2023,"It's okay people, you're not alone!","With regard to the hordes of people who have praised this film, I've abandoned the idea of the ""Emperor's new clothes"" or herd dynamics in favour of a medical disorder of epidemic proportions - this being Visual Agnosia. I have of course questioned whether it's a personal failing on my own behalf but dropped this idea following consultation with other likeminded individuals who seem tuned in to the here and now. Let's be clear, I like quirky, and I recognise and appreciate originality, and of course clever humour and emotional depth. These are all central components in my appreciation of a good film. However, I have to say that I recognised none of these characteristics in Everything Everywhere All at once. For me, it was simply a convoluted mess that encompassed some naive notions of ""imaginary science"" alongside trite everyday woes. As for humour! I guess that's subjective, but banana skin slapstick is hardly sharp-end comedy. And for budding screenwriters, the depth of the dialogue between two incongruous rocks might be an example not to follow.

20 March 2023,Beautiful explanation of a hundred different emotions. A piece of art.,"This movie was definitely a metaphor for so many different emotions you could feel towards life and family: frustration, anger, depression, existentialism, love, kindness.... More than anything, I'm amazed that it was able to clearly express all of those things amidst a very chaotic way.

This movie is more of a piece of art than your typical beginning-middle-end stories where everything has to be explicitly stated for you. If you're having a hard time following or understanding the film, I urge you to at least finish the whole thing first and go through all of the emotions the movie makes you go through, no matter how lost you are, because it's part of the experience watching the film. I'm glad this got the recognition it deserved.

Don't go in with too much expectations. Go in for the experience. Pay attention to the movie, but don't over think it while watching it. ABSORB as much as you can. It's a great ride and I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Like anything in life there will be people who hate this. Half of them just want to complain about something or perhaps this genre is not for them(why see it then?) Anwyays. Don't pay attention to the detractors. LIke I said. Go into the movie with an Open mind. Go for the experience. This movie may surprise some while for others you will get a lot out of this movie. It's very very entertaining movie but at the same time very very very very..................Profound!!!!!!

15 August 2023,A Unique Cinematic Journey,"This left an indelible impression with its originality and distinct narrative. Having watched it twice, my appreciation for the film's creative storytelling and unique structure only grew stronger. While I found some inconsistencies upon my second viewing, these minor flaws did not overshadow the innovative plot and execution. The movie's ability to seamlessly blend different dimensions and timelines showcases its ambition and daring. The intricate web of emotions and realities that the film weaves is both captivating and thought-provoking. Despite the discovered plot holes, the film's creativity remains unparalleled, elevating it to a level of distinctiveness that is rarely seen in contemporary cinema. Without delving into spoilers, I can attest that ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a testament to the power of imagination and unconventional storytelling, and it provides a viewing experience that stimulates the mind while pushing the boundaries of cinematic storytelling.

17 May 2022,"A poor Matrix wannabe about a Mother Daughter relationship on the rocks and ""what life could have been, if, but be happy with what you have""","The funny part is I hardly need to write more than that title. They tried too hard with this one, and like one of the very few critics who was right said, "" it lacked finesse in its story-telling, "" big time. They tried to make it into this deep moving story about the universe but it falls very very flat on every level.

The whole jumping universes was really really dumb and poorly executed, again it really reeked of trying to copy the Matrix concepts and ending up in epic failure. Just not captivating at all, NOT deep please, not even moving really no tears from me and it isn't hard to bring them from me. Best things I can say is it is somewhat unique (less my Matrix comment), there was decent action in the way of fighting scenes at times and there were some laugh at loud scenes for sure. The laughing scenes saved this getting a 1 from me.

Wanted to walk out of theater many times, wish I had even the end was stupid but thankfully part 3 was very short like 1 minute because I was really dreading it. Worst movie I have seen for a long time sorry. Now had I dropped Acid like one user suggests, yeah, it could be a 10 then perhaps.",3
23 May 2022,Did someone put drugs in my beer?,"I'm still reeling from having seen EEAAO. There's almost certainly a parallel universe somewhere where Old McDonald had a film called EEAAO, as the old nursery rhyme has it. If I had ever taken mind-altering drugs before, I might have been on familiar ground, but as it was I think the film makers took those drugs for me. I don't know they were on something at the time, but how else do you explain this incredible concoction?

One of the things I liked best about it was the unashamed willingness to be a vehicle for monumental silliness. If you don't like ridiculous humour, this film might wear thin very quickly. Luckily, I do enjoy it when done well, and for much of the middle act of the story the ludicrous spectacle was relentless, and hilarious. You just never know what's coming next.

But happily for some there's much more to EEAAO than absurdity and comedy. It's also quite touching, and charming, and has a few serious points to make about life, which avoids being mawkish or overly sentimental (just), thanks in part to leavening with the aforementioned silliness.

It's also incredibly imaginative. To combine the mind-expanding elements with the utter mundanity of a woman struggling with her taxes, and make a coherent story that ultimately pulls all the loose threads together for a surprisingly satisfying conclusion, is quite an achievement.

There's also quite a lot of subtitled Chinese dialogue, which switches back and forth from Mandarin to English and back to Mandarin again, because the main characters are all Chinese living in America, and speak both languages. This can make it hard on the brain at times, but stick with it; it helps to expand the mind!

Oh god, I've just had another flashback! Excuse me while I try to explain why I'm pissing myself laughing out of the blue again.....",9
16 September 2022,Has everything you'd want,"This movie is funny, action packed, trippy, deep, and uplifting. I don't think any movie has ever made me feel such a roller coaster of emotions.

Not sure why this review is saying it is ""too short"" lol i have nothing else to say. Kinda wack that they do this. Read the above paragraph, that is all you need to know. Go into this movies as blind as you can.

This for me is probably a top 10 movie ever. The character development is pure class and very well acted. The husband in particular, is basically the best human ever and i have written down words he said to help me live a fulfilling life.

Finally, ""minimum character limit met"" lol.

6 March 2023,Absurd that makes sense,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

18 June 2022,You here right now,"Well, the movie of the year will not be a $100+ million budget movie, but a smart, funny, heartfelt, creative piece that will take you to other possible outcomes of our lives, teach about family relations and roles. Gosh I love this instant classic and makes me want to watch again and pay more attention.

It will make you wondering about ""what ifs"", your choices in your past and your future possibilities, trick you into believe that nothing means anything, but at the end, where everything comes together you realize that in life, it's really you and here and right now.

1 April 2023,I have been longing for this!,"The multiverse theme, the humor - both sardonic and relieving while also absurd and therapeutic, the cinematic brilliance, the boldness and the superb acting, it all came together in this masterpiece that I will watch again and again. I can't think of any movie that stitched together such a complex storytelling with this many layers and aspects, and made it work. It is truly an achievement that will be studied for a long time. I am so happy for all the appraisals this movie got, which will inspire future directors and producers to go places they previously would not dare to go. I have been waiting for a movie like this a long time. It is like a blend of cinematic and storytelling aspects of ""Being John Malkovich"", ""The Matrix"", ""A clockwork Orange"", ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""Turning Red"", and then multiply the chaotic mess with 10. It is brilliant!

24 March 2023,Awful,"That's how I describe it, awful. When I asked my husband.what he thought about it he said ""I don't know"" I said I don't understand what that means and he said I don't know what to say about it, my mind is f'd from watching it and I can't process a thought at the moment.

We always try to watch all of the Oscar nominated movies each year. There have been several that we didn't really enjoy, but they were at least watchable. This movie is almost impossible to watch. We had to divide it in 3 nights because it was so awful. 20 minutes the first night then 30 minutes the second night, then finished it on the 3rd night, but had to take a break about 30 minutes into the 3rd night. I'm actually angry that we wasted our time on this garbage. We kept thinking and hoping that it would get better, but it didn't. We never would have watched this had it not won so many Oscars, I just don't understand how anyone could enjoy this migraine inducing mess.

Our advice is don't waste your time on this dumpster fire, it really is awful. I have no idea why it was even considered Oscar worthy much less all the nominations and wins.",1
1 November 2022,One of the best movie of the year.,"Not only this is the ultimate movie on the multiverse, even better and more powerful than Marvel and Netflix movies and series on multiverse (Dr. Strange, Loki, Umbrella Academy, etc.). And I am a great fan of that fantastic stuff.

Not only this is the ultimate cinematic trip: visionary, crazy, with such a lot of creativity at its best and many ideas that you won't believe they belong to only a two-hour-and-a-half movie. You will leave the theater with the head upside down.

This is also a great, beautiful, inspired and inspiring movie. The Daniels are in a state of bliss. Someone gives an award to those writers and directors for this masterpiece.

I think this movie is taking a little longer to catch mainstream because it is so hard to describe. I had never heard of it and just went in not really knowing much about it...so glad I watched it in the theater. Amazing movie...insane movie... ...life changingly brilliant movie....a piece of art.

Wow wow wow! The Daniels is back, and once again deliverd a phenomonal movie.

Everything Everywhere All At Once is a totally bonkers and just an amazing movie. This movie really has it all, great comedy which made me laugh out loud a couple of time, the action sequences in this movie is great with some really awesome choreography. And the story is really great with a really beautiful messages.

This is just a phenomonal movie that really caught me. This is one of the best movies of 2022. A24 has done it again.

20 August 2022,A superb film.,"Despite some pacing issues, which made the movie feel a lot longer than it actually is, ""Everything, Everywhere, All At Once"" is a wildly imaginative , original and funny movie. It succeeded at making me question every single important life decision I've ever made, as well as making me laugh hysterically in a few parts.

Excellent.

24 July 2022,In order to enjoy this film you only require 2 functional neurons,"I've heard a lot of good things about this film and awesome reviews etc. So I was excited to watch this one. And boy this film is bad, the jokes are bad and the pace is awful, I just can't understand why people is saying is good and deep when the jokes are at some point even annoying, the husband with his squeaky voice is terrible. And everything everywhere all in this film sucks a part of me wanted to leave the move theater or die when I already felt that 3 hours had passed and I had just watch dumb stuff happen and it appears ""Part 2"" I was like no way man I just want this to end. I really don't understand what is wrong with the people praising this film does this people have brain damage or something? Because believe me this film is way to long for what it is, it's just beyond dumb this film. If you have any respect or you feel you are at least a little smart and have some self respect. Don't watch this.

30 January 2023,Masterpiece,"""So, even though you have broken my heart yet again, I wanted to say, in another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you.""

A marvelous masterpiece that is both entertaining and thought provoking. This movie touches on so many points that I can't be bothered to list them all. But most importantly, the film is about the comparison of nihilism and Confucianism. The rock scene was amazing. Without a doubt one of the best movies of the 2020s. Very well thought out. I really liked the visual effects and was shocked when I read the note in the trivia section. Incredible work. I really appreciate the directors and actors.

16 April 2022,A new neighbour of Slaughterhouse-Five,"I should say that I didn't really like Slaughterhouse-Five much, and while watching this movie I didn't like it much either. But while by the end of Slaughterhouse-Five I still didn't really like it, I did end up liking this movie by the end! They are similar in the sense that our main characters are faced with an entirely new view of the world as if they have ascended to a higher dimension they can freely traverse, and they must grapple with the idea that nothing truly matters. I feel both don't really reach their full potential mainly because they make themselves too chaotic to truly enjoy, but this movie certainly still worked. And so this review isn't just reviewing a movie and a book at the same time, the visuals were also spectacularly beautiful and the acting was quite great mainly from the Joy character(s). Overall glad I watched.

18 May 2022,The best film of 2022 so far.,"It was movie magic throughout the film, A genuinely moving film with great acting, editing and fantastic visuals, it really has it all.

And the Oscar goes to Michelle Yeoh, This role really showcases her whole range of acting. She is so much more than just a magnificent martial art and action film heroine.

The whole cast was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was hilarious! And it was nice to see Ke Huy Quan. I hope we can see him in the next Indiana Jones film or a sequel to the Goonies, make it happen.

23 February 2023,Don't stop watching until the end!,"As soon as I finished watching this film I knew reviews would be mixed and, regardless of the hype, I was right. I can see why some people would switch off prior to the end (I never do) and i was finding it all a bit tedious about three quarters of the way through but then it all started coming together in a most glorious and moving fashion that propelled the film to one of my watches of the year. Its like a giant, crazy, jigsaw puzzle and you only really see how beautiful the picture is when all the final pieces are in place. I get that one of the films themes was ""what could have been"" but for me it was more about the complexities of a mother daughter relationship.

13 June 2022,The Dissection of story by story,"All stories are told in someone's perspective. Perspective is always limited. As a result, it becomes incomplete and factually incorrect.

In this film with the, common events and choices of daily life had been shown in multiverse theme .Already there are films which are made with similar theme. Like The Matrix, Mr. Nobody, Dr. Strange. But this absurd comedy film is more complex, chaotic and multi-dimensional.

Based on many variables, we come to the conclusion what happened with us either good or bad, right or wrong and so on. All such conclusions are irrelevant and don't matter in cosmic scale.

Philosopher Alan Watts said, The meaning of life is just to be alive.

It is so plain, obvious & so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond them.",9
27 March 2023,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"Although this movie does have some humorous and touching moments and some good action scenes they are drowned in an interminable morass of frenetic randomness. Nothing really connects with anything or means anything and the plot , such as it is , never really progresses. It's ultimately a huge and tedious mess, a sort of failed experiment.

In all fairness, the actors all give good performances, especially considering that they have to portray nany different characters. The sets and special effects are imaginative and evocative , creating an extremely multifaceted universe, some of it anchored in the past , some very mundane and some very futuristic. There is lots of fast and unoredictable action. Unfortunately, all the good qualities of this movie are completely sunk by the abysmal script , which totally fails to hold one's attention. You could walk out at any time during the running time and not miss out on anything.

24 March 2023,This slaps,"Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is an excellent film that is both visually stunning and intellectually engaging. The film's unique and creative use of colors and special effects creates a truly immersive experience for the viewer, drawing them into the multiverse and the adventures of the characters.

The acting in the film is also superb, with Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Jamie Lee Curtis all delivering outstanding performances. Each actress brings a unique energy and perspective to their role, and their chemistry on screen is a joy to watch.

Beyond its technical and artistic merits, the film also succeeds in exploring complex ideas and themes. The nature of reality, the multiverse theory, and the interconnectedness of all things are just a few of the ideas that the film grapples with. The film's ability to balance these more profound concepts with humor and action makes it an enjoyable and thought-provoking watch.",10
14 April 2022,Quite simply the best movie ever made.,"Maybe there are comedies funnier. Maybe there are dramas more emotional. Maybe there are sci-films more intriguing, or action films more thrilling. But no other film in existence does them ""all at once"" quite like this. If you've ever felt plagued by lack of meaning in your life, or burdened by existentialism - Daniel Kwan has blessed you with an antidote. Enjoy.

I laughed until my stomach hurt and cried until my eyes were red, and through it all I was contemplating the meaning of life while exploring the idea of the multiverse. This movie is truly Everything Everywhere all at once.

I believe it to be one of the greatest films of the past decade, without a doubt. It is an exciting mixture of emotional ups and downs, and every scene has a deeper meaning behind it.

This movie is a must-see for every film buff, especially if you enjoy delving into a variety of concepts and find the notion of the multiverse particularly intriguing.

13 August 2022,Absolutely insane movie that's unique in all the memorable ways,"What a wild film, even by A24 standards. Despite reminding me of a lot of films and filming styles, I haven't really seen anything like this movie before. It feels like what A24 was born to make and reminds me of the energy in Swiss Army Man if that movie were good.

Movie's a wild mess and I think it's more confusing than some Nolan films, but it works. The colors are vibrant, alternate realities imaginative, and characters interesting. It's also way funnier than I expected, both in dialogue and physical action humor. Really brings the action comedy of Jackie Chan into a contemporary reimagining.

Cast is solid, with the actress for Joy being far better than I expected. She demonstrated a wide range in this role and nailed every end of her emotional spectrum. Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy. Quan, and Jaimie Lee Curtis also do an equally commendable job, but that's not as surprising coming from seasoned actors.

The movie's long and though there's little fat & all loose ends are tied up, you're still left wondering how far into the story you've gotten at every turn. There's not exactly a definite fix here, but it was one of the few things I think this film could have improved on.

It's a creative story even if it was confusing for me, solid action, great comedy, fantastic actors, and a reasonably compelling set of character arcs.",8

But it just got worst abd was totally senseless. How could they give this movie an Oscar is beyond my understanding. I am happy for the actors, but since the movie was so crap, I really didn't feel the performances. I do hope the Oscars bounce back next year and award meaningful cinematic movies and not just blindly follow the diversity trend. However please give it a go and see if you can make any sense of the plot. Maybe I didn't get it, but someone else could relate better.

8 September 2022,Very good,"In Swiss Army Man, the debut film from Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan (collectively and fitting known as Daniels), Hank (Paul Dano) and his corpse friend Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) shoot out of a river propelled on the power of Manny's farts. As they fly through the air, they sing a song to each other that goes: ""You just have to remember that we're all here for a purpose, and the Universe picks its time. Everything, everywhere matters to everything."" While Swiss Army Man only lightly touched on this idea, six years later, Daniels' second film Everything Everywhere All At Once almost makes this verse a mantra amongst a cavalcade of insane multiverses, unlimited possibilities, and endless creativity. Daniels has given audiences a wholly unique vision that literally feels like everything everywhere all at once.

Leading this trip is Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh at maybe her all-time best), who runs a struggling laundromat with her overly-optimistic husband Waymond (an equally fantastic Ke Huy Quan). When we first meet Evelyn, she's surrounded by receipts, thanks to the laundromat getting audited, her husband is putting googly-eyes on bags of laundry, and it doesn't take long for Evelyn to embarrass her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu) when introducing her girlfriend to Evelyn's father, Gong Gong (James Hong). To make matters worse, Evelyn doesn't know Waymond has divorce papers, and IRS inspector Diedre (a hilariously wild Jamie Lee Curtis) accuses the laundromat of fraud. As someone tells Evelyn later in the film, Evelyn is living her worst you.

But that's not to say Evelyn hasn't tried to escape her monotonous life. We learn she's wanted to be a singing coach and an author, amongst other interests that became hobbies instead of life-altering careers. But Evelyn's life irrevocably changes when a version of Waymond tells Evelyn that she is just one of many Evelyns, yet she's the only one that can defeat a powerful villain named Jobu Tupaki, who could destroy all the universes (and there are a lot of universes).",10
4 August 2022,Trifecta: Fun + Thoughtful + Oscar worthy script and acting,"This movie is best gone into blind. This is a glowing review that promises 3 things: 1. Laugh-out-loud funny absurdist humour; 2. Thought provoking questions on life, existence, and purpose; 3. Fantastic performances plus a script that's sure to get some Oscar nods. You should stop reading and go watch it now, ideally avoiding a trailer as well.

For those that want to know more, such as why the script is Oscar worthy, to me this movie is a blend of all movie genres done very well. Similar to how Parasite was a nod to Hollywood stories with meaning and meaning told through film, this is a nod to Hollywood genres and all the ways you can tell a story.

The themes covered in this film match the title. It has all the themes. There is something for everyone, whether that is someone looking for slice of life family drama, musings on nihilism and the meaning of life, or how many absurd dick dildo props you can squeeze into a movie that shares scenes set as romantic film noir about missed connection lovers sporting $10,000 gowns and suits.

The acting is superb, from both Yeoh and her supporting actor Ke Huy Quan. The range of their performances is surely Oscar bait, but serves a purpose in the story. The protagonist's daughter (Stephanie Hsu) plays a very relatable struggling teen for younger viewers as well. I'm glad Awkwafina had to bow out of this role, it would have been hard to imagine her struggling and seeing her as anything but awkward.

Finally, and most importantly, this movie is fun and enjoyable. I avoided this for so long despite glowing peer reviews thinking it would land on either the two extreme ends of a dumb action movie (it's not, it's quite deep) or a way too heavy-handed dry philosophical painful slog (it's not, there is a lot of light hearted fun).

23 April 2023,A cinematic marvel that proves kindness and hope can prevail against all,"I'm ashamed that I waited so long to watch this film. What a beautiful, poignant, funny, emotional movie this is. Everything from the story, the themes, the writing, the acting, and the editing makes this movie a masterpiece of cinema. Michelle Yeoh put on a tour-de-force performance for the ages, and she deserved every award that she won. The same can be said of Ke Huy Quan. I've seen iconic movies from Citizen Kane, Vertigo, The Godfather, Goodfellas, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, The Shawshank Redemption, and Back to the Future. When we look back at this movie in ten years, I feel it will be given its place among those greats and regarded as such. It's a cinematic marvel and is one of the greatest movies ever made.

28 May 2022,What did I just watch?,"Amazing! Brilliant! Funny! Unexpected! I have never seen anything like that movie, ever! From the great casting of the protagonist and the side characters to the imaginative story and the hilarious-at least for me-jokes, this movie easily climbs to one of my favourite movies. I don't think anyone can describe this movie to a friend and prepare them for what they are about to see... It's madness and I think more people should watch it! This movie didn't get the attention it deserved.

29 April 2022,An Intense Experience,"Hard to please people it seems. We thought this movie was fantastic and creative. It's a bit of a breathe of fresh air as you don't really know what to expect. The movie keeps you guessing pretty much the entire time and has the mind bending moments that make you go what the f.. a great watch and enjoyable film which is what it sets out to be.

We do however agree that there is some minor issue with pacing as for some parts it would have been good to flesh out some parts more story wise. Potentially like Kill Bill and do several parts to really get a truly satisfying ending.

17 April 2022,Best of 2022 so far,"Please make more movies like these. This is the most creative and plot innovative film I've seen in a long time. The movie perfectly balances the line between being a trippy, hyperactive, dimension-hopping sci-fi adventure and a surprisingly resonating comedy-drama centered around a dysfunctional family near perfectly. It takes concepts and tropes you've seen a million times in other movies and puts a real spin on it, often leading to unexpected twists and turns that keep the narrative engaging despite its somewhat perplexing universe jumping plot. This movie is not going to be for everyone but it deserves to be seen by everyone at least once. Also, please avoid spoilers for this movie if you can. Some movies are just meant to be seen going in completely blind. Trust me, you'll be setting yourself up for the best viewing experience.

16 April 2022,Shotgun approach to ideas did not work for me,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

8 June 2022,A Cinematic Tour de Force!,"Best movie of 2022 nothing. This is an easy candidate for one of the best movies EVER!

The best way to explain what I just saw is a perfect collaboration of brilliance from every part of the production - writing, acting, wardrobe, FX, directing, just damn all of it.

I like never wanna STOP watching this!

28 January 2023,"This is not a movie, this is an experience","I saw this movie twice in theaters, the experience was bar none, I would suggest watching it on a big screen or like you would in a movie theater, totally better that way ( I say this as I am rewatching this for the 3rd time on my PS4 on an old TV & it doesn't really make the cut as far as viewing experience wise), but it's still the brilliant movie I remember. Deep & vastly personal, funny & therapeutic, it's not a traditional film, and that's okay, and it's more than okay, but be prepared to ingest it & sit with it for awhile. Not for casual viewing. This is worth a number of rewatches and I plan to own this at some point.

12 June 2022,Amazing,"This movie was incredible, honestly I don't what to write to give it enough praise. Every other review you have read already or that is already here it's true. Such a gem of a movie, such a nice story that I think everyone can relate, thinking about what could have happened if we took different road on every crossroad we ever been. Definitely a top 3 movie this year and everyone should watch it, entire cast was great Michelle especially, but everyone else did great work as well. Loved everything about this movie, it will make you think and about your life in the end and when a movie does that then you know it was great.

18 October 2022,Postmodern but not Pretentious,"It is sadly quite common for new movies nowadays to be politically correct in a forced manner. Token racial characters are inserted into movies without any real reason than to diversify the roster. This is not the case here. This movie has Asian culture and philosophy onboard not just token Asians. Furthermore, it is not politically correct, as it makes fun of stereotypes and in general it does not take itself too seriously. This makes for an entertaining watch, that is filled with funny action sequences and all kinds of dark humor.

In a multidimensional universe where everything and anything that can happen, will happen, is there a reason for morality? Is there even any kind of meaning? The simple answer is no. This kind of nihilism manifests in the postmodern world through the philosophy of existentialism. In its foundational premises the philosophy revolves around the fact that existence comes before essence, and thus no true meaning is a given for one's life but must be created through culture or other means. Nietzsche took this premise to question the nature of morality itself and how it is built artificially and can't be espoused rationally and universally. First, one character who grasps this lack of meaning and purpose struggles in mental anguish and adopts Albert Camus' absurdity ideals, just trying to enjoy the ridiculous nature of the universe. As this gets old though, the character begins to adopt Kierkegaard's idea of the abyss and despair in the form of the abyssal bagel. A multidimensional entity that acts as a black hole that swallows everything, created by the character to help end the suffering of the meaningless world and the hopelessness. In terms of overall message, it does not try to be subtle, the message is kindness and love. The way to best nihilism and answer the existential question, is not to answer it, but to dodge it entirely and focus on each other; the fellow humans that we can help ease their suffering through acts of kindness and compassion. Although a pretty standard good message, it is delivered in a captivating way and in an entertaining envelope.

The cinematography is quite intriguing and done in a very cool way. With striking visuals that capture the absurdity of multidimensional existence. The CGI here serves the movie, rather than take away from it. The cast is brilliant and really carries this movie in terms of humor delivery and emotional release. That is except for the daughter, Joy, who I personally found irritating and too clich√© in terms of her character design (the teenager trope is really overused). Other than that the movie is quite solid and I would definitely recommend for others.",8
8 June 2022,wow!,"This movie is amazing. I laughed, I cried. It really made me appreciate The little things in life. Michelle Yeoh knocked it out the park with her amazing performance, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis were also fantastic. I really love this film and it's by far my favorite movie in the 2020s.

15 March 2023,Do not waste your time,"This movie, I don't know whether I should call it a movie or not, is a disgrace to all the movies that won oscars and to those movies too that are critically acclaimed but didn't win anything significant. How on earth this movie becomes nominated for 11 oscars amd win 5/6 whatever is beyond my imagination. Don't waste your time. Please. I mean, honestly, what were they thinking? What was the idea of this movie? Sausage fingers or bagels? Unbelievable. And if these two actors actresses win oscars, then De caprio or Al pacino or Brad pitt type actors should win oscars all day every day. Do not waste your time please.

24 May 2022,Nolan's level of storytelling just marvelous,"Everything everywhere is just.....there's no word to describe it, it just felt like a Nolan as great of a ride and as complex to understand but you can't take your eyes off the screen no matter how long...I couldn't believe it was a 2h movie cause it surely didn't feel like it.

It's by far the best screenplay of 2022, the best in developing the multiverse since Spider-Man into the spider verse and yes I've seen Spider-Man no way home and Dr Strange in the multiverse of madness both of them weren't even close to be as good as those 2.

The cast in general was just perfect, you could see all the shades of Michelle over the years she was just perfect for the role, best I've ever seen her.

This movie deserves everything everywhere all at once üòâ....should be at least nominated and win for best screenplay at every award show next year, literally the only movie of 2022 I was proud to watch on the big screen...it's been a long time since I've worked out of a theater feeling I've seen something great something that I'm gonna think about all night until I fall asleep.",9

24 February 2023,Best movie ever!,"It's not lime anything you've seen before.

Some will love it and some will definitely won't.

But it had such a profound emotional and intellectual impact on me!

Wow!

I watched it seven times already and it just hits every note. Every time.

So moving, so intense.

It has everything, just like life.

It's brilliant writing and directing, and the cast sooo good!

Such an amazing artistic way to tell a family's story, everyone's story. Our story.

It's mind blowing when you realised that every choice in life a different path and how much love was needed all the time to heal the hurt.

Love is all. Be kind , fight different.

Just forgive and embrace change. Well I'm sold It should take each Oscar ! It deserves it.",10
22 March 2023,Nothing Nowhere all together bad,"One of the worst films I've seen in a while. Original screen play for sure but the rest of it was pretty incoherent nonsense. I'm not entirely sure how it got the Oscar for the best motion picture, just more evidence that Hollywood has lost the plot. Don't believe the hype it's awful. Time watching that would be better spent doing something else cause you'll never get that back. I never normally leave reviews so it's unusual for me to break cover and comment but it was that bad I felt compelled to prevent anyone else going through this bore fest. It's like a crap version of the matrix with short round in.

5 July 2022,Best movie so far in 2022,"This movie is a organized mess, everyone in this movie did a perfect job from the actors to the editors, they created the confusion of the characters and how scared they are, it let you ask yourself what's next and what's going happen, how they are going through this , jumping between the scenes is spotless, it's like organized in messy way .

The only thing that have little set down is the propaganda they are sending and the predictable of the ending wish is not so much to be honest.

But Definitely one of the best movies i watched in 2022.

But for those who just love to watch anything that forces you to think. It's for you. You get lots of philosophy in this movie, And let me tell you. It also has lots to it meaning some action, drama, science fiction and comedy. It is a kind of movie I would think would win many awards including best film as the featured award. The acting is amazing. With an open mind the movie pulls you in and takes you so many different directions. I highly suggest this movie! Just a eclectic piece of art.

You could analyse this movie so thoroughly only to find ur bot ever half way through all the themes and emotions depicted !! In loooooooooooove. Like wow??? Please watch. You will not regret it. Ps: probably for ages 13+ though, there is a couple of graphic scenes. Also another thing i love about this movie is how it depicts a chinese immigrant household, as it doesn't include nothing but stereotypes, but uses so many creative aspects to create the movie. As an immigrant from china this movie is such a masterpiece. Another thing i love is the lgbtq representation and inclusion. Love this movie 10/10.

1 September 2023,Every Movie You've ever seen,"All at once. That's my title for this highly overrated film.

First cinematography is good. Editing outstanding. So it's not a cheaply low budget indie.

However the script is a mad lips of anything and everything. The Matrix, Weird Science, Kill Bill, Hidden Dragon, Power Rangers. I could go on but seriously there's a lot of rip offs in this film.

And then there's the Oscar to Jamie Lee Curtis. Seriously...why? There's nothing outstanding or brilliant about her 10 minute role.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody. Some folks might think it's interesting but others not so much. Very bloated overhyped film.

18 August 2022,"""Complexity"" is the main character","This movie is just wowwwww....!! I don't really know how to react to the plot, but despite of all the casts are playing their role, the main character of this movie is ""complexity"".

I can't imagine how to write a script for a movie with such complexity and also for the casts to play the role, and that is why I have to give 9/10 score. Creativity and imagination over the roof...!!

Multilayer plots like this is sometime fun to watch although may give you headache, but for this movie, just don't question the timeline, don't question the tech, don't question the other details and just enjoy watching it.

21 June 2022,You either get it or you don't. I'm glad I did.,"If you don't get it, you'll hate it and you won't understand why anyone would love it. That's okay. It happens. Not everyone understands subtext or allegory.

If you do get it, you're in for a masterpiece of absurdity, surrealism, existentialism, comedy and ultimately, humanism.

This is one of the most insightful and realistic depictions of ADHD, depression and anxiety I've ever seen. Yes, I used the word realistic about a film where characters may have hotdogs for fingers, or they may be a cartoon or a rock. Because it's not supposed to be taken literally. Everything is subtext. Everything is a metaphor. Everything is an illustration of absurdity to make a point.

The way this film handles the subject matter and delivers its message is a masterclass in using over the top silliness as a way to convey something subtle and nuanced.

Its that no matter how many times we regret things or wish we done things differently it does not matter,

We are in the best verse possible and have limited time so we shouldn't care that much and take it easy.

21 March 2023,A Bottle of Human Experience,"There are few films that capture the breadth and diversity of human experience. Many of those that do make use of large casts, budgets, and show many storylines occuring at once or converging together. Some are anthologies. This film didn't need any of that. Touching, comedic, and exciting, this film displays what could be considered a slice of life buried under an extremely entertaining science fiction action story. Credit to the actors, of course, but there are also scenes without acting that elicit a genuine emotional response. Just watch it. And to all who think that the newest Top Gun sequel should have won more Oscars... this movie isn't for you.

Honestly how has this scored over 8 is baffling. Has to be next level corruption.

The cast act well, it's just so ridiculous and immature.

It's certainly the most wildly creative movie I've ever seen, but on top of that it's so emotionally moving. I don't even know how to express how this movie made me feel, it's such a rollercoaster, I really felt euphoric after watching it. It was so refreshing to watch something that's just shamelessly sincere. It's loving and absurd and moody and goofy and thought provoking. What else can I say? This is an absolute masterpiece.

One of the weirdest, funniest, most heart warming movies I have ever seen.

You have no time to process any sort of emotions, one moment you're sad, one moment you're happy; one moment you're relieved, one moment you're angry.

I was worried the ambition of so many things in one movie would fall to pieces, but it really didn't. It held up. It suprises you the more you watch it.

Loved it so much.

21 May 2022,"It truly is everything, everywhere all at once","I've been excited for this film as it's gotten great reviews. Whilst the plot is hard to describe, it's the type of film where you just have to trust that it's going to be good and enjoy the madness as it happens.

It's a film that manages to cover every genre there is, which is something i don't think I've seen before.

I admit that it was very confusing, but I think that's intentional and it's so wild that it makes it that much cooler.

Michelle Yeoh is a great lead and there were some minor roles and cameos that would have been fun for the actors to be involved in.

The action scenes were amazing, which were reminiscent of films like Kill Bill and The Matrix (minus the butt plugs of course). Top marks for visuals, music and costuming too.

An extremely imaginative film that is both quiet and chaotic, interesting and entertaining, it's all of those things, everything at once.",8
14 April 2023,Don't focus on means of expression,"You don't have to try to understand this movie. I see a lot of people here commenting they are not smart enough to understand it. You don't have to be smart and you don't have to try to understand anything. You need to forward this movie from your eyes to the abstract part of your brain. This is a movie of ideas. This movie asks questions, it doesn't give answers. It doesn't try to set rules, it doesn't tell you what is truth, good or bad. That's why people are confused after watching it.

The current capabilities of visual art and the usual ways to express ideas in cinema are not at the required level to represent such abstract ideas, that's why some episodes look ridiculous. When you look at the ideas and you don't focus that much on the means of expression, all makes totally sense..

27 December 2022,Horrible.,"Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I sat through the entire thing, my nerves were wrecked by the end. It appears someone must've taken a hit of acid before they wrote this, totally impossible to follow, felt like it was going to trigger a seizure. And all the extraneous stuff, like the obsession with sticking things up peoples' butts, and butt plugs. That was just so out of place and weird because that did not fit into the storyline, and seems like it was just put there, like everything else in the movie, just because. I would imagine the actors, who seem to do a good job doing the impossible, probably did not know what the purpose of what they were doing was as everyone watching this insanely horrible movie. The only reason I gave it a two was for the actors. How anybody could've given it more than a two , I have no clue.

19 May 2022,8 stars for sheer GUTS!,"Ok. So this felt like a very long movie that is probably 30 minutes too long for comfort/entertainment. But it is ambitious and doesn't fail on that count.

What it also does is take you on a rollercoaster ride. So be prepared to keep up!

Quite enjoyed the premise and Yeoh is, as always, playing a character that demands your attention. Loved her acting in this! Jamie Lee-Curtis is hilarious and added some brilliant acting chops to the story.

10 August 2022,One of the best films in decades!,"I am too stunned to write much. But this is amazing. All the naysayers miss the point the the film is a gorgeous tribute to Michelle Yeoh. It is a love story to her, and as such takes it's place in the great movies that do this (Fellini's La Strada comes to mind). To watch this movie, you need to dig it like a great jazz concert: full of intensity and improvisation. Thank you.

17 May 2022,Absolutely Amazing,"It's just amazing, i dont know what to say, im crying real hard it's also telling the nihilsm nietzsche wants, when everythings dont matter anymore well, just do it, why should we care, keep moving forward and do what we want because it's doesn't matter anymore, it may be frightening, but go on and maybe we dont know what going on ahead, but still, be kind, values the others.

And also, i really like how the movie telling us how a random things that happen everywhere in life can change everything.

14 August 2022,Major Disappointment at Every Turn,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie. I'm a big fan of Michelle Yeoh (I love her in Star Trek Discovery, and I anxiously await her own Star Trek Section 31 show), plus, I love shows that deal with the multiverse.

Somehow, this show let me down, completely, thoroughly (and all at once). It literally looks like it was made for young children. The acting was sub-par in many cases, the characters were almost all caricatures, the special effects were uninspiring and the plot was like that of a basic Saturday morning cartoon.

I tried sitting through this movie, but after two attempts, I still only made it through 1 hrs and 12 minutes. It was that annoying.

How this garnered an 8.1 IMDB score is beyond me.

21 May 2022,If Edgar Wright and Charlie Kaufman made a Multiverse film...,"As someone else commented, the most comparable film to this very original experience is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind...or if Edgar Wright directed a script from Charlie Kaufman. That's how crazy and original this film is.

I do get some of the negative reviews, as this film isn't for everyone. But, if you're into multiverse type films, it's easily one of the best. There are so many Multiverse ideas packed into this film, it will be hard to catch them all in the first viewing.

I've been a film buff since a child so have pretty much seen everything there is. This is one of those films that will blow you away with its originality similar to Eternal Sunshine, Her, Being John Malkovich, Mr. Nobody or other films of that ilk. Easily a 9/10 and will watch again to catch everything missed on the first viewing.

P. S. For other films about the Multiverse and alternate realities, there's a good list of films at kneelbeforezod.io/tag/sci-fi-alternate-history-films/",9
15 September 2022,WELL.. Possibly the greatest dream I ever had!!,"I will always try and watch anything with Michelle Yeoh in..and this has to be up there with her finest work! No spoilers here.

It was Beautiful, sad, crazy, deep, funny, polished, euphoric, dreamy, .. but most of all an epic story about the loves we have.

To quote the great Ke Huy Quan. ."" He who loves the most, regrets the most "".

This really really resonated with me.

The editors and costume need a massive congrats on their work. The director also really deserves a pat on the back for holding this all together...because it must have been a tough job.

I always score as honestly as I can ... unlike the political or fan girl/boy reviewers who score their favourite actors/political motive movies 10/10 even when its a terrible movie.. But this IS a genuinely solid 9/10.. sit back, put your phone down and watch this crazy masterpiece before the USA makes a mainstream copy as per....",9
17 March 2023,Worth watching because the best movie,"This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story was the best. The lines and the dialogues of the characters are amazing. It has more deep meaning in this movie. I loved this movie so much. I liked the editing and VFX and everything was perfect. The main actors in the movie did a great job. The editors are the best. This is what I called a perfect movie. I will totally recommend others to watch this movie. It's worth a lot. I have learned a lot from this movie. This movie changed the way I think everything. This movie opened my mind. I will love to share this movie with others.

28 May 2022,Too good to put into words.,"I'm lucky enough to have seen this with little expectations having not seen the trailer or hearing much about it before I took my wife to see it.

To me, this film was a masterpiece. After a semi slow first 10-15 minutes I was on the edge of my seat the entire time completely engrossed in this film. I was hysterically laughing and crying often.

After the movie, we sat through the credits unwilling to even move as the profound messages, insanely creative visuals and hilarious comedy were digested. Instantly one of my favorite movies ever as it had so much soul. I question if those who rate this a bad movie have a soul and brain. This absolutely deserves well over an 8 on IMDb and I encourage anyone and every adult to go see it.

PS - kudos to the amazing cast, crew, writers and directors. They all had to be at the top of their game to make such an amazing movie.",10
15 December 2022,An Experience Like No Other,"I came coming into this movie with a low expectation, but was found breathe taken, and speechless for days. Thinking, and dreaming, and experience life for what is was, and when I say this movie will change you. This movie represents love, grief, family, pain, heartache, and life all together in a unique and beautiful experience that's breath taking. The directors unique style can bring comedy, and true feelings of sadness and grief to the screen and make you able to connect to the characters and story. I've never EVER seen a. Movie quiet as breath taking as this one, I highly recommend this film, and I thank you to the creators of this for the experience it gave me.

7 July 2023,Everything Everywhere All at Once Common Sense Review,"I had no idea what to expect walking into this film and I am happy to report that this movie absolutely blew me away. This film is bright, filled with color, and packed full of pure insanity. Going hand in hand with this colorful film is its themes of family, love, and the consequences that coincide with one's actions. This film made me laugh, tear up, and connect with these characters which reminded me why I love film so much and why I created this Instagram page in the first place. If you have the opportunity to support this film wild and wacky film and be ready for the ride of a lifetime.

What were your thoughts on this film?

There is a tiny bit of a story that makes sense and is appealing but this movie fails tremendously as it is filled with nonsensical fillers that is supposed to be funny or sad or super cringy.

4 May 2023,Millions of times better than any movie has any right to be,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

20 May 2022,It was a spiritual experience,"There are not enough words in the human dictionary to describe what I just experienced. It was profound and completely absurd. It is the MUST SEE OF THE YEAR. I sat in my car sobbing well after the movie just completely humbled and grateful for my beautiful life. If you gave this movie a bad review I would suggest seeing it again and approach it with an open mind and heart. Every little detail was so well thought out and orchestrated perfectly for an audience to feel something they've never felt before!!! BRAVO!!!!

18 May 2022,Wow....................,"I can't believe the amazing and mind bending story I just experienced. I am just blown away by the story telling and cinematography this effortlessly life changing movie made me question my own reality. It was flawless from the characters to the plot. Everything I have been waiting for and wanting in a movie for so long. It breaks all aspects of how a movie should go from this unassuming relatable family in its own problems and culture, to this unbelievable story that's ripped across all realities past present and future all at the same time.

This has the Matrix (the original) feel to it but at the same time Total Rdecall (the arnold version) vibes, with a little new once to make it its own. The character development is standing ovation worthy and keeps you on the back of your seat in fear of what comes next. But leans you forward to hold on for more. I can't believe this is what this movie was. I was expecting a mediocre seen it before tale that had some new twist, but I was pleasantly surprised that I was taken on an original journey through mind altering thought to the point where I was questioning whether I was in the movie or some spin off of reality waiting for my own body to be tagged in and fight.

All I can say is it is a must see for everyone who wants a new original thinking journey to ride along with and not think about awards or criticism. Just to take a ride on another state of mind all together. I commend you for reading this but can't wait for you to realize what you are in for within the hours to come in this unbelievable joy ride you are about to partake.

Enjoy the ride and please open your mind to what is coming!!!",10
6 July 2022,Best Multiverse Movie Ever,"I dont often give a film 10 stars, but this was superb. It was an intense and bizarre ride, with the strange concepts stretching so far out there at times, it was as though they made more sense. It was visually stunning, the costumes were epic, and the balance of humor and emotion was perfect. LOVED IT. No one else was meant for this role other than Michelle Yeoh. She brought the lead to life in the most beautiful, meaningful, perfect way. This whole movie was mind blowing.

9 May 2022,What in the world does everyone see in this?,"The best way to describe this film would be to imagine that it had no script at all; that the actors just had to improvise everything in real-time; and just feign strong emotional reactions and rhetoric when they're out of ideas. Add lots of CG and jump-cut the slices, and you're pretty much there. Absolute torture to watch.

17 April 2022,Modern art in a film,"Absolutely amazing film, and probably the most original I've ever seen! It's humor, storytelling, cinematography, and raw emotion are on point. At certain points, the whole theater was laughing. I was surprised at how the movie was so chaotic and all over the place, yet managed to pull everything together so neatly to create a fantastic piece. Especially as an Asian American, it was so relatable and moving as well. This film didn't just feel like a story, but an emotion, and I absolutely loved every moment of it. Truly a work of art.

11 May 2023,This film is way better than everyone makes it out to be,"It seems as though this film has gotten a lesser response from audiences than critics. I think this film knew that it wouldn't appeal to everyone.

With all films of recent being sci-fi, action-packed blockbusters, it seems as though audiences today can't connect with a deep message.

The films score, screenplay, and acting create an eerie, thought provoking experience for some viewers, while other consider it a disorganized mess.

While I wouldn't consider it a masterpiece by any means, I don't think it was trying to be one. It was trying to push a profound message onto these ADHD filled audiences that won't be contempt without an action scene every five minutes.

And, for me, it succeeded. It felt like a mix of Doctor Strange and Eternal Sunshine. Grabbing some of the best and most thought provoking elements from both.

Although it's not the best film, and sure, it does lack in certain areas, I consider this to be the best film of 2022, not my favorite per say, but the best.",8
10 June 2023,A true masterpiece,"""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" is a mind-bending cinematic experience that effortlessly transcends boundaries and immerses viewers in a multidimensional journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. Written and directed by visionary filmmakers, this ambitious masterpiece challenges conventional storytelling norms while igniting the imagination with its boundless creativity.

At its core, ""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" explores the intricate tapestry of human existence across parallel dimensions. The film weaves together a complex narrative that demands intellectual acuity and an open mind to fully appreciate its profound themes and symbolic representations. It invites the audience to dive deep into the metaphysical realm, provoking introspection and questioning the nature of reality itself.

Some viewers who rated this film below a perfect score may have found themselves overwhelmed by its intricate storytelling and unconventional structure. The movie challenges traditional linear narratives, opting for a kaleidoscopic approach that effortlessly blends genres and blurs the boundaries between past, present, and future. Consequently, those who prefer a more straightforward plot may have struggled to navigate its depths and fully engage with its complexities.

However, it is important to recognize that this film's brilliance lies precisely in its ability to provoke such diverse reactions. While some may find themselves momentarily lost in its labyrinthine corridors, those who possess the intellectual acuity to embrace its multidimensional nature will be richly rewarded with an awe-inspiring experience like no other.

The cinematography and visual effects in ""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" are nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame is meticulously crafted, offering a visually stunning feast for the eyes. From ethereal landscapes to intricately choreographed action sequences, every scene is a testament to the creative prowess of the filmmaking team. The expert use of color palettes and innovative camera techniques further enhance the immersive nature of the film, enveloping viewers in a captivating visual symphony.

The performances in this film are nothing short of extraordinary. The ensemble cast, led by a magnetic and versatile lead actress, delivers performances that seamlessly blend vulnerability, strength, and emotional depth. Their portrayals bring authenticity to the multidimensional characters, allowing audiences to form a deep connection and empathy with their struggles and triumphs. It is a testament to the director's skill in guiding the actors and extracting nuanced performances that resonate long after the credits roll.

One of the film's most notable achievements is its ability to provoke philosophical and existential contemplation. Through its intricate narrative layers, ""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" explores themes of identity, interconnectedness, and the fluidity of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their own place in the universe and the impact of their choices on the fabric of existence. This thought-provoking journey transcends the boundaries of traditional cinema and becomes a transformative experience for those willing to delve into its depths.

In conclusion, ""Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"" is an intellectually stimulating and visually captivating cinematic triumph. While it may require a certain level of mental agility to fully appreciate its multidimensional storytelling, those who embrace its complexities will be rewarded with a cinematic experience that transcends traditional boundaries. This is a film that invites viewers to reflect, question, and explore the very essence of their existence. It stands as a testament to the boundless potential of cinema to challenge, inspire, and expand our understanding of the world.",10
20 May 2022,Lovely piece of art ! Fantastic movie.,"I enjoyed this movie a lot because it really does resonate with how I feel with life. It also plays to the phrase you can't runaway from your problems regardless of how short the distance or how vastly extensive the multiverse is.

Just also want to praise the entire cast as they were all amazing. It felt like everything hit too close to home and all of the stylistic choices and mix of drama, comedy and action were perfectly tailored to make this an instant favorite for me. 10/10.

20 August 2022,Lamentable,"I was looking forward to this one after all the rave reviews, but I somehow missed the fact that it was directed by the jokers behind SWISS ARMY MAN. Sure enough, it turns out to be a cheesy, repetitive, scatological mess of a comedy with a multiverse hook that goes nowhere and does nothing, other than copying previous sci-fi flicks like THE MATRIX. The action is nondescript; the whole thing turns out to be a simplistic family drama, the ending entirely predictable. Michelle Yeoh is an old favourite of mine but I felt embarrassed for her here, and I'm not even going into what Jamie Lee Curtis is made to do. This film's a good example of why I avoid modern Hollywood comedies like the plague.

29 July 2023,The main cast shine in this multiverse comedy,"I have heard so much hype coming from this film even before its release. As I have finally gotten to watch it on the big screen, there are so many words that I can use to describe my experience towards the movie. And that is mostly positive things that are hard to be put into words due to how Everything Everywhere All at Once is a confusing yet a thrilling and entertaining film that I will never forget. To A24 pictures, this is probably the best that I have seen from you yet and here is why I loved it.

Michelle Yeoh, who is best known for her role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is an absolute blast to watch. She is by far the most standout but even the whole cast as well delivered when they are given screen time throughout the film. I love the fact that her bickering and being confusing makes a whole lot of sense to her because I too, as an audience member, was very confused at what's really going on. But by the time she eventually learns to acknowledge her problems and flaws towards herself and her family, she becomes a lot more relatable.

And yes, as I have stated before in the previous paragraphs, the film is absolutely confusing. In addition to this, it was a non-stop rollercoaster of craziness and off-the-top humor, particularly sexual jokes, that added more fuel to the fire of confusion that I am getting. The action sequences though are also cool and not to mention how funny the jokes delivered by everyone in the cast, in particular is Jamie Lee Curtis who I was surprised was part of this movie.

I am also happy that this is one of those films that does feature the element of the what-if routes. Seeing what Michelle Yeoh's protagonist could have been in other universes is a great and also relatable way to the audience because we also imagined what our lives would have been if we took the other choices in life.

Remember the iconic quote of Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop ""whatever happens, happens"" - this basically sums up my love for the movie and interpretation to reality. Just like the movie, sometimes there we always be moments that you will face a difficult situation and as you start to think that it would have been better if I lived another life, always remember that sometimes, living your life to the fullest in all the mishaps you experienced with the people you are stuck with is better than regretting everything that made you come to this point of your life.

So basically, even though I said Hustle was my favorite movie of 2022, it seems like Everything Everywhere All at Once has just topped my list. Please Oscar, nominate this film for Best Picture and give Michelle Yeoh her very first Best Actress nomination because she literally carried the film the entire way through. Yes, there is more to come in the second half of the year but I bet no film can be as standout as what the Kwans did. If you haven't seen this film, I would be very jealous of you because you are going to have an exhilarating yet memorable ride with the movie.",9
30 May 2022,"You don't watch this movie, you experience it.","You don't watch this movie, you experience it.

I watched this movie on Friday and was completely stunned. It was like for the first time in my life, I was seeing a real movie. Everything else, from the Godfather to the Titanic had been a nice story, but at the end of the day, just a story..about people often very different from me.

This on the other hand, was something deeper, some more real. It perfectly brought to life one of the deepest, most personal questions we ponder in life: am I living my best life...or wasting it?

It is the first movie I've been to where when the lights came up at the end, no one got up to leave. People just immediately started excitedly talking about what they had just experienced.

Image if Picasso made a film that combined the Matrix with Cloud Atlas. It tells a very profound but relatable story about the importance in a seemingly meaningless world of valuing kindness and family/friends over all else, even if it doesn't always make sense.

It does this by shooting a firehouse of storytelling twists and visual imagery at you for 2.5 hours that at times starts to feel exhausting but in the end...you realize was a necessary metaphor for the complexity of life and the infinite set of choices we make in life.

This is a kind of movie that comes along once every 20 years. Go see it folks.",10
19 May 2022,"Everything, Everywhere, Hot dog","I went into this film with high expectations already from the reviews alone. But holy moly. This film exceeded every expectation. First of all the acting was superb and i found every character likable in different ways. The strange and wacky humor just made it that much better. Overall i would give it 10/10 hot dogs.

17 March 2023,Bye bye haters,"It's rather satisfying to realise that those that hated this movie (and it looks like there are plenty) will never darken its doorway again. All their outrage, self importance, pomposity and demand for attention poured into reviews that will be forgotten soon enough while others, with more open minds may well revisit and enjoy the breathlessness and originality of this work of art all over again. So cheerio one star, two star, three star reviewers, move on, and find something else to comment / hate / love in movie world, there's plenty out there for you to write pointless critiques about isn't there. After all, nothing matters does it?

15 March 2023,..soon i will get you.,"Ok to be honest, looking at the cover, i thought this was another marvel/hollywood's attempt to make an asian most certainly chinese action flic crossover with a bunch of washed up actors.

As so often in life it turns out to be a different thing and i need to accept i wasn't aware and in addition to that i fell for the 'don't judge a book by its cover' hokuspokus..again.

Not only the cover is leading you in a wrong direction even the movie will if you don't look with an open eye or mind in this case. Flashy on the outside, philosophical challenging and more than once not easy to accept on the inside. Talking about the movie here and not life, i think.

You will get yourself into a spectacular hilarious ride full of up and downs with multiple layers of Interpretation. Its on you how far you go.

Take it as what it is. And try not to judge before you have sorted out what chaotic mess it could leave behind after the credits finished this two and a half hour run into a universe of ....",9
20 August 2022,What a Pisser!,"I loved Everything Everywhere All At Once. I laughed a lot. Loved the IRS Brooklyn bubala. Huge flying dildos will always get a laugh. That slo-mo goosing was a pisser. The movie started out simply. The Chinese mother, juggling 100 things at one time in her laundromat business. The Chinese father, so sweet and caring. Then all hell breaks through. This film had every single feeling, thought and idea that humans ever had in our 200,000 years on Earth. But enjoy!

25 April 2023,"Mind-Bending and Visually Stunning Journey Through Parallel Universes""","Everything Everywhere All at Once is a mind-bending and visually stunning movie that takes viewers on a journey through parallel universes and alternate realities. The movie follows a middle-aged woman named Ling, played brilliantly by Michelle Yeoh, who discovers that she has the power to access multiple dimensions and parallel universes. Ling is forced to confront different versions of herself, including a ruthless and powerful version who seeks to take over all the universes.

The concept of the movie is both intriguing and complex, and it may take some time for viewers to fully grasp the different realities and timelines. However, the strong performances by the cast, especially Yeoh, keep the audience engaged and invested in the story. The movie also features stunning visual effects and a captivating score that enhance the viewing experience.

While the movie can be confusing at times, the unique storyline and themes of identity and self-discovery make it a worthwhile watch. Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a thought-provoking and entertaining movie that pushes the boundaries of science fiction and leaves a lasting impression on its viewers. I would highly recommend this movie to fans of mind-bending sci-fi films who are looking for something fresh and innovative.",8
23 May 2022,A gems like few others,"It is difficult for me to overstate what I think of this film. The script is creative, fun and original. The direction is energetic, clever and tight. The cast is too notch.

I mean Michelle Yeoh is a fantastic actress but the rest of the cast (special mention to james hong) is on par with her.

A must see. For me the best of 2022 without a doubt and possibly one of the best for a very long time...

18 April 2023,"Love it or hate it, this movie may change your life","So many accolades everywhere, including the Oscars, and yet so many hecklers on IMDB just evaluating the movie as 1 or the worst movie they've ever watched. This tells me that it messes with you, it brings discomfort that some people just cannot handle. I watched this at the movies after a much anticipated hype - probably the first trailer that didn't tell me the whole plot. I was not disappointed. I watched it again at least twice after it came out on streaming, there's always something I see from a different perspective, a new lesson in a way. It's humbling. Yes, the movie has plenty of silly or weird parts, but if you don't understand their purpose, you definetely did not understand the movie's true potential and its basic premisses.

14 March 2023,Is there a universe where this film doesn't exist,"What a load or rubbish, even Jamie Lee Curtis must be wondering how this won so many Oscars, it makes no sense, it's terrible acting throughout, the boy people who should of won the Oscars are the stunt men, as no attempt whatsoever is made to hide their faces u don't even need to pause it to see it's not the actors doing the fight scenes, how this film beat all the others to best picture is beyond me, only 20mins into the film I thought is this seriously what all the hype is about but I stuck it out until the end hoping for it to improve and it didn't. No wonder jlc thanked all her Halloween fans in her Oscar acceptance speech as this was more than likely an Oscar win for her career rather than this film.

18 June 2022,This gave me Everything all at Once,"This is one of the most creative fun movies I have seen in a LONG TIME. There were moments that made me laugh out loud and cry out loud. The story has heart and is rich with creativity (in cinematography and writing), you can tell the writers had a blast making this. It is such a fun rollercoaster of a movie that makes you want to get back in line and enjoy the ride again immediately after watching it.

To compare to a movie like Christopher Nolan's Tenent where it is 100% based on ideas and plot and completely forgets heart or soul this movie has so much plot and so much heart leaving nothing behind.

This movie is so dense with amazing ingredients. I have seen it multiple times and I'm still picking up new things to talk about and discover. It is sad to say that I felt more in this stand alone movie than I have with many saga movies or tv shows.

It is true not everyone will like the same movies but if you enjoy movies with meaning, heart, creativity, action, comedy and everything else then Everything everywhere all at once is a movie absolutely worth giving a shot.",10
4 August 2022,"Phantasms, metaverse and chaos","There are so many opportunities to fantasize (daydream) in everyday life (when you are working, when you are driving, when you talk to a friend or a colleague, when you watch tv, and so on) that if you allow yourself to be overwhelmed and invaded by phantasms, it can become complete chaos in your existence. And with the metaverse, it's worse. Congratulations to the scriptwriters, directors and actors for translating that chaos into a seething and swirling movie. More than ever, we must follow the Latin advice of Ignatius of Loyola (founder of the Jesuit order): ""Age quod agis"": = do what you do. And stay focused on every task, even the smallest and simplest. This is the only way to avoid chaos.

18 May 2022,"Can't run, can't hide: Can't escape myself.","None of us can. Daniels and the Russo Brothers collaborate in a mind-bending film bringing together the legends Michelle Yeoh and that one kid from The Goonies and Indiana Jones all grown up. Polarizing forces in the life of their daughter. Movie is really existentialist and nihilistic at times, and I love it! Does any of this life actually matter or is it just what you choose to do with your time? Is there any innate reason for us being here or do we just make it up as we go along? I understand exactly how the daughter was feeling as if she was just so tired of going on and on in a box, all for it to end with so little having been accomplished. The visuals in this movie are eye-popping, and this was a fun adventure with parallels to The Matrix, but way cooler! Made me wish I could escape from my life and hop into another me in another universe. I guess we just need to understand and love the people in our lives for who they are. Take it or leave it, all or nothing. Use what little time you have together and make the best of it while you can. What else is life besides what we make it? Put everything on your bagel, or eat a plain one if you wish, nobody can tell you how to eat it. Superb acting and an overall beautiful movie that is a definite rewatch for me.",9

18 April 2022,The blue/black white/gold dress of a movie,"The blue/black white/gold dress of a movie: inexplicably, some people love this movie; others hate it. If you enjoy ""kung fu meets potty humor"", and like your movies low brow and juvenile, you'll love it. If you go in expecting profound and meaningful, with something to say about existence, multiverses, or achievement in life, you'll be disappointed. It's a chaotic mess of a movie that tries too hard to shock and bewilder, while missing any opportunity to use that shock to get more than surface level with its premise. It's like someone saw The Matrix, then decided to remove the philosophical ideas and change the fight scenes from visceral to silly. It's no fault of the actors, the costume makers, or photographers: the blame lies squarely on the writers whose convoluted experiment in simulating ADHD on screen is a self-indulgent mess.

I cant stress enough that actor Identity doesn't matter. The story and characters do. There's so much fun and joy in this film as well as a couple of hard hitting emotional moments.

Some people cannot suspend their disbelief for 2 hours but for any sci-fi junky or average person, this movie will really make you reflect on your life and FEEL so many different things! Some people don't like being made to feel things that they'd prefer to ignore, I get it, but again for the mature viewer you will truly appreciate the ARTISTIC manipulation of your emotions. This movie takes you on a journey that few films ever will! I loved it and this is a tour de force for Michelle Yeoh.

10 December 2022,It grew on me,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

18 September 2022,Watch While Baked,"111 out of 10 stars

Everything Everywhere All At Once feels like a mind-blowing combination of a kung-fu movie, kung-fu movie parody, soap opera, dramedy, live from the Lincoln Center opera, & Sci fi with an emotionally deep culture clashing family written by someone with ADHD doing acid listening to some Darkside Of The Moon, while Heavy Metal the movie is playing in the background, staring comic con favorite celebs, being aimed at for an Academy award based on a book by Phillip K Dick, remade by James Gunn, the Snyder cut version, choreographed by Sammo Hung, produced by Eli Roth, stunt coordinator Zoe Bell, anime, anime adaptation.

Imagine if the comic con people started their own movie studio & had it run by cosplayers: Ivy Doomkitty, Jessica Nigri, & Animia. That studio would have made this movie.

The storytelling feels like you're just flipping through channels & getting one big story from the channels being combined cohesively.

None of the people named are involved, it just feels like if they were is what I'm trying to convey.",10
18 May 2022,Next Year's Oscar Winner !,"I simply can not rate this film highly enough. From the bizarre, yet hilarious, sense of humor to the exquisite over the top action scenes this film simply excels in everything it attempts. It's difficult to categorize just what this film is exactly about: Is it about American-Asian mother daughter interpersonal relationships? Is it about how we handle our own trauma and pass it along to our children? It is about hilarious riffs on a variety of genre movies?

Yes. It is about all of the above and so very much more. In an age where Marvel comic book movies seem to define the big screens, this movie stands out as a reminder of whet the media used to be and could be still. The movie quite literally made me laugh and made me cry. I can't recall the last time a movie did that.

Just be kind to yourself and go see this movie.

I actually can't speak enough about michelle's performance. She is unbelievably talented this incredible woman moves through this film like a champion. Michelle yeoh is my new idol. Honestly, i'd almost advise you to not learn too much about it before you see it. It's so mega. And so meta. And so expertly made.

10 August 2022,I've never laughed and cried so much in one movie,"I adored this movie. This movie plays with the viewers. It jumps back and forth between so many scenes and genres and amazingly it works nearly flawlessly! It spoofs the Matrix and ratatouille (LOL!) some other movies, but simultaneously pays homage to them. The movie touches on almost every genre and plays into them. And just when you think the silliness is over the top, it grounds itself in some seriously profound philosophy. What blows my mind is that as big as the movie gets, it then becomes very intimate and is centered on familial relationships and what it means to love those closest to us and life in general.

14 December 2022,Fun and wholesome,"This film is the perfect mix of heartbreaking, hilarious and mysterious. Full of convincing performances, it carries a heart through the whole thing which you don't see in many films these days.

The first time I watched it I was slightly confused but now I see how that makes sense to reflect Evelyn's (Yeoh's) position in it. The second time made more sense and I picked up on more, which is what a lot of directors want from their movies so well done to the Daniels!

Definitely one of the best movies of the year and I am sure that I will be watching it again in the future. I highly recommend it, and it's also a good film to watch in a group of friends/with your family.

11 April 2022,This is... MADNESS- Everything Everywhere All At Once Review,"I literally just got out of seeing Everything Everywhere All At Once, and this might be one of the most underrated movies ever! Michelle Yeoh crushes it as the lead star in this movie, and has a performance that is super memorable. Now, let's get to the main part of this review because DANG!!!!!!!!!! This film is Madness, and it's bonkers! Depending on how Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness goes, this might be the most bonkers multiverse film of the year! It goes into many spots which are weird, and that's this movie in one word: Weird. And not only is it a great multiversal superhero story, it's a family movie, an adventure movie, a thriller movie, and a emotional movie. It packs a punch on what it does with the plot and villain and characters, and the surprises this movie has in line for the audience is so worth it!

I know you probably didn't have Everything Everywhere All At Once on your movie radar to go watch, but your going to be doing yourself a MASSIVE favour if you buy a ticket and go see this masterpiece!

8.5/10.",8
24 April 2022,"Entertaining, ragged, way too long","Well acted, indifferently written screenplay, alternately intricate and shabby production. Difficult to understand this movie's high ratings.

Don't get your hopes up. The cast does the very best possible job with a screenplay that feels like it was written stoned by amateurs with good imaginations and too much time on their hands.

You don't need to see this one in the theater. Watch it at home, stoned out of your gourd. Take breaks when you need them; things will be much the same by the time you get back.

Rethinking my opinion, I believe I really liked this movie. The little action in it was great, the multiverse hopping was very cool and there were many emotional moments.

21 April 2022,An uexpectedly awesome journey.,"I had the urge to resist the movie at the beginning because it was hitting too close to reality. I forced myself to work through the inital dread and anxiety and found myself immersed in an exercise in finding acceptance. The overall theme of the film is an important one we need to face as people and as a society overall. Can we just be ok with being ordinary? Can we heal and let go of our regrets and past mistakes to live for now? I found this movie wildly thought provoking and emotionally exhausting. Great fight sequences are always a plus for me, and there was some good ones here. Even the multiverse aspect which is overused lately was used in an inventive way. I wasn't into some of the crude and juvenile humor though which is why it doesn't get higher marks from me. (And there is A LOT of that.) Still a great film that demands a watch even with the step down humor included.

This movie feels like CRANK with Jason Stratham; once the plot begins, the viewer better hold on. A roller coaster of emotions, but none so powerful as the climax. It's easy to relate to every single one of the characters. This movie will enlighten the audience whether the movie's message is revealed or not. Amazing acting from the leads, with undeniably humorous moments. Absolutely worth a watch and post discussion with friends and family.

I gotta say it was a good watch, you can even see that making this movie seemed to be lotta fun. The actors did a pretty good job also, and it was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis playing her role.

I mean okay it may have been a little bit over the top a few times but thats alright tho.

And the script. THE SCRIPT! There are so many iconic lines that have still stuck with me and impacted me with the delivery of its message even in its ridiculousness. Anyone should watch this film it might not be for you but at some point in life you can appreciate this film for some reason or another.

Truly a masterpiece.

I've seen alot of movies...... I experienced Everything Everywhere All At Once.

18 May 2022,This is a Multiverse movie well done!,"The movie itself doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should you! It has plenty of absurd jokes and moments and some of these might turn you off. But please, don't let those ruin the movie for you! Do watch it with an open mind. This is really a great movie! I really can't say anything about it without spoiling for you but you should give it a watch!

Also compared to the Multiverse of Madness, this movie shows that if you know how to spend your money, a great movie can be made! Obviously there's more to that but this shows that you can spend alot of money and your movie can still turn out to be mediocre at best.

Like I said in the title, this is how a Multiverse movie should look like! They really captured really well the essence of each universe shown in the movie and this is exactly how Marvel should have done it!

Again, words are few to actually appreciate this movie!",10
28 May 2022,More than just a movie,"This movie is.something else, it is a cinematic experience over anything else but the realisation and acting are all top notch.

Reading the rfeviews I can see why there so few people rating is average since it is either a 10 because you understood what the movie is about (it is NOT a comedy or a sci-fi movie) and will rate it 9 or 10 and the people who just did not get it and give it a 1 or 2.

If you rated this movie 1 or 2, you're just not ready, that's fine you might get it rewatching it in a few years hopefully because when you do this is one hell of a ride!

21 June 2022,"What a crazy ride, truly a brilliant movie!!","This film is something special. If there was a blueprint for a multiverse movie this has to be it.

The emotional roller coaster, performances from the actors and amazing cinematography was truly glorious. I was in disbelief how crazy (in a good way) this film was. A must watch!!

28 January 2023,Unwatchable Dribble! Hideous! 2+ Hours of Wasted Life!,"OMG... this thing is HORRIBLE!!! Not only do I want my $8 ticket price back, I want a refund of the concession money and, more importantly, the 2+ hours of my life back! Read the reviews and note that you should see this while stoned or insane to find enjoyment in this god-aweful thing! I see probably over 60 movies at theaters a year.. and hundreds outside the theater, and rarely do I find a movie that I can't find enjoyable in some aspect (from great story to wonderful acting, beautiful cinematography, great soundtrack... something), but this thing is SO bad that I rate it right down there with ""Hot to Trot"" (1988 /Bobcat Goldthwait). A movie SO bad that IMDB truly needs a ZERO star rating!! If you MUST see this, wait until it comes out on Betamax (NEVER!)

14 September 2023,Fantastic,"This movie is absolutely brilliant. It's pretty rare for a movie to be able to leave me speechless, in thought, belly laughing, and wanting to tear up all in one sitting, but this one did it.

This movie is ALL about symbolism. If you just take the movie at face value and try to piece it together literally, it doesn't make a ton of sense. And I see a lot of reviews point that out. If you're that kind of person, this probably isn't gonna be the one for you.

But if you can view it in the abstract, for the story it's telling, it's absolutely relatable and heartwrenching. Regret, missed opportunities, marriage, family, kids, everything. It makes you reflect on your own life even.

If I could change anything about the movie at all, I'd probably have trimmed some of the fight scenes. They weren't bad at all, but seemed more added for comedic effect, and pushed the runtime up just a little more than I'd have liked I think.",9
22 April 2022,"Original plot, original film, stellar cast","Incredible movie, with a very original plot. Never seen a movie with such a great story, a mind twist, action packed, drama, and comedy all at once. What a great experience that is unforgettable. A gem of the decade.

I mean what an amazing performance by the actors, just incredible to carry it through with so many different versions of themselves as characters.

This is a MUST SEE movie for anyone and everyone.

11 March 2023,Absolutely Loved This Movie.,"Entered straight into the pantheon of my favorites - and that's high praise. Love, love, love the fact that two middle-aged women get to kick ass in it, to boot. And that it passes the Bechdel test with flying colors. And, most importantly, that in the end it's about love of family & that twisted, prickly, yet somehow unbreakable bond between mothers & daughters. Kudos to the Daniels for figuring this out.

I was glued to the screen the entire time. Acting, production design, editing, music, VFX, costumes (Stephanie Hsu's outfits & James Hong's chair!) - everything was spot on - and delivered with a sensibility that both honored & skewered movie tropes with heart and humor. Deserves every award it gets.

21 May 2022,A Masterpiece of a Hidden Gem,"Where do I begin? There's just so much to talk about this absolute masterpiece of a movie. The action, the drama, the humour, the subtext, the cinematography, the emotions-and most of all, the weirdness.

I will try my best to put into words how beautifully this movie was brought together with a neatly wrapped ribbon on top. I don't do movie reviews but this is something I just cannot resist writing at 4 AM because the pure adrenaline will not let me.

Intro

I will admit that I need to watch it 2-3 more times to fully grasp every drop of what the directors poured into the 2+ hour runtime of the movie.

When I started watching it, I was so confused as to why this movie came highly recommended as it seemed very crude and bare at face value.

But the more I watched it, the more I delved into the multiple realities the movie takes you through. It just draws you in and you cannot stop watching with every obscenity, every chaotic scene and every inexplicable moment that passes. It's a steadily meandering curve of insanity and chaos from start to end.

Action and Choreography

Violence is usually depicted as a raw amalgamation of gore and barbaric roughness. This movie polishes a scintillating diamond through the beautifully choreographed fight scenes. Creativity knows no bounds and nothing is repetitive in any of the confrontation scenes as people are killed off in the most elegant ways imaginable with the help of colourful visual effects.

The movie somehow manages to antithetically depict the other side of the coin, addressing violence with kindness and compassion in a truly unique way.

Writing & Characters

There is a perfect balance of comedy, action and heartwarming poignance.

At the start, you are introduced to characters and plot points seemingly unrelated to each other. Right until the end, all of these characters are thrust into each other's lives in the most unfathomable ways and each character plays a vital role, no matter how small.

The overarching plot seems somewhat fundamental at the surface level. It's the plethora of underlying plotlines and abstract messages that really form the core of the movie. The science fiction aspect takes a backseat to the more pertinent themes that are constantly overlapping sporadically.

To put that on a scale, Doctor Strange is a 6-year-old's art homework.

Emotions

The story explores the lives of 3 separate generations of a family who hate as much as they love each other. The generational gap is evident right from the start, with each one having nuances in stark contrast to the others. These various relations burgeon into something indescribaby wholesome across their shared experiences.

Coming to the quirkiness aspect of it, I have no words. I am inexplicably drawn towards zany and quirky plots and sequences that make superficial sense to the common viewer. I found myself uncontrollably laughing every 2 minutes while simultaneously being absolutely bewildered at the nonsensical shenanigans transpiring in front of me.

Cinematography & Direction

The director duo of the Daniels, responsible for another one of my all-time favourites-Swiss Army Man, absolutely smashed it out of the park yet again. The way one scene shifted to another while my brain was stuck processing the earlier one really captivated my full attention. They've also thrown in a little treat for fans of fourth-wall breaking, completely novel and never seen before.

There are also a few segments within the movie that give you a breather to take in everything and contemplate the meaning of life along with the characters themselves.

I would be gravely remiss if I did not mention that the VFX team was comprised of only SEVEN people entirely, an outstanding feat for what they've achieved.

For simple-minded Marvel fans, this is produced by the Russo Brothers. Do with that information what you will.

Shoutout to the Actors

The acting, on the other hand, felt a little less than organic, if I had to criticise just one thing about an otherwise flawless production.

For Asians to have such brilliant interaction on an English medium is remarkable on its own, as seen with Crazy Rich Asians. It is with that same energy that Michelle Yeoh brought her A-game and really flourished. The other cast members also carried their role to their fullest in their own idiosyncratic ways.

The Verdict

This movie had me at the edge of my seat, processing several emotions at the same time. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a completely new experience that pretty much condenses an entire cinematic universe in just 2 hours. It's a refreshing change of pace from today's hackneyed Hollywood industry that seems to care more about profits than quality, and offers a hidden gem unlike anything you've ever seen before.

It was wholesome. It was thought-provoking. It was alluring. It was insanely mind-bending. It was everything, everywhere, all at once.

If you actually read all of that, I appreciate it. If you just skipped to this part, shame on you. Either way, go see it asap. It's a must-watch masterpiece that I'm definitely gonna find myself re-watching over and over again.",10
20 March 2023,Unwatchable.,"Glad I didn't watch the academy awards. I have tried twice to view this film. I actually like the entire cast, but not for this cringeworthy film. They are a great group of actors who deserve a better vehicle. Boring is a complement. The multiverse concept is a Marvel plot flagpole in their current phase. It sort of works, but EEAAW takes it to the point of making it so distracting that it destroys the film. I'm a big Marvel fan who is losing interest because of the chaotic, use of the multiverse concept. How about we do a new biographic film about Gandhi, Jesus, or Mother Teresa using the multiverse. It would sweep every Oscar, hands down. The sheep would be in heaven, despite not having a clue about the main characters real lives, contributions to humanity.

26 November 2022,It was well worth watching,"Honestly was not sure what to expect from this. Was told it was good and to watch it, and went in without knowing much at all about it.

Well, heck. It starts out a little slow but builds non-stop and by the time it was over I didn't want it to end. I won't go into the details of the movie or voice my opinion on the acting or science. Who cares?

It was very entertaining and worth a look for quite literally anyone. That's saying a lot about any movie out there. Easily in the top 5 of movies I've seen in the past year and I recommend you watch it. Any issues that other reviewers will bring up simply cannot justify not giving it a view. Wanna watch a movie and not sure what to check out? Watch this one. It won't disappoint.

6 April 2022,Standing ovation,"Easily the most entertaining movie I've seen in years, and I watch a LOT of films. Extremely well executed, easy to follow, visually stunning, and probably the best movie about the multiverse that's been made so far.

In theaters, every showing in the last few days has been packed, and for good reason. The jokes had the audience roaring, and the ending had at least 4 people on my row wiping tears from their eyes. Haven't heard that much applause at the end since Endgame (and this was easily better than any Marvel film!)

Overall just a vividly creative and original movie with an ambitious plot.

20 August 2022,Best movie everyone should watch,"I first watched this in the theater. It became my all time favorite movie. Now i am currently watching it because i have been so depressed about the direction our world is going. I realized it would boost my spirits to know that there are people in the world who still care about humanity and love. Please watch this movie. It is necessary for everyone to know that everyone is just who they are. Everyone is what encompasses our world. Not just one group's beliefs. Its what i thought america was supposed to be. But now so many of our ideals as the nation we were supposed to be are being systematically destroyed.

23 May 2022,This is a movie about being a bored God who is done.,"Imagine if you were a God that could make anything happen (more or less), you could travel to any instance in time at will to any part of the multiverse do anything you wanted. Yet you felt unfulfilled by these powers and you became destructive, not having anyone around to share in your powers.

It would become terribly frustrating, this movie is about a version of a person who becomes a God and has decided that enough is enough, she is checking out into the void but wants someone to share this experience with her. But in embarking on this journey to find 'another Godlike being' to share this new desire for oblivion she finds that the other Godlike being doesn't believe in destruction and the futility of it all, quite the opposite.

This is an incredible movie and for me at the end was quite moving. I've not seen anything so good and inspiring in quite a few decades to be honest.

16 October 2022,Perfectly perfect in every way,"I don't know where to begin or how to describe this film without doing it an injustice. It needs to be seen, it is sad, laugh out loud, trippy, thought provoking, beautifully acted by all.

It has suffered from poor advertising and I had no idea what an absolute gem was hiding on streaming. Like a lot of other perfect films cinema bank doesn't do it justice, I hope that word of mouth, home video and streaming gets it the views and appreciation the love and act put into this fantastic film.

I don't know how the film makers made this, and kept the viewer in touch and not lost in the mind bending tale. I'm so much better and happier for watching it, thank you.

11 January 2023,Love is never the answer for Asian family issues. Twinge is.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",8
4 September 2023,Forgettable.,"So much hype. Yet after 6 months I barely remember anything about this movie, which says it all really.

If you want to waste 3 hours of your life on a film none of your friends will remember, or ever talk about or ever want to watch again, then this is it.

The production quality is pretty good, and the pretence different and potentially interesting, but the film undermines itself by continuing longer than 60 minutes. It actually becomes obnoxious in the end as you're forced to sit through a relentless durectionless assualt on the senses. You give up assuming that there must be some sort of point to it all, and just hope it ends.

It's a shane, I feel it could have been a lot better.

9 August 2022,Just Skip The Haters,"We were all been waiting for a movie with this kind of greatness since The Joker, other people had mentioned in their reviews that the multiverse concept has already been completed with Spider-Verse, Doctor Strange, etc. I have watched all of those movies and they are great and original, but the difference between them and this one is that you can't find any kind of flaws in Everything Everywhere All at Once , this one is just perfect in every way ( the acting, the screenplay, the directing, the creativity, the emotions and the philosophy behind the plot). This movie is an epic masterpiece.

13 March 2023,Perfect!,"7 Oscars is just a little that this film is able to conquer.

The actors and actresses have impressive faces, changes they humor synchronizing changes in the multiverse context. I think beyond relationship mother's and daughter, this film shows our only way to have a significant life is love, because all things including own lives is ephemeral.

The edition is so incredible! Many too short takes forming bigger takes of minutes should demand long time, so editors did an excellent work.

The auxiliar actor did an unique actuation and the Oscars cames to recognize him.

The words to Michelle Yeoh is just incredible and perfect. She brings you in a journey between expressions.",10
28 January 2023,Remarkable film with stunning acting and visuals,"This really was one of those films that sit with you for a few days and make you think about its premise in your own life. Such a thought-provoking and original story, with deep characters brought to life by the brilliant cast. Michelle Yeoh's performance showcased wonderful character development, alongside Ke Huy Quan's effortless ability to portray the many lives of Waymond.

The visuals of the film are absolutely stunning. Some have described it as ""an assault on the senses"", which I certainly agree, though it is coherently done so that the audience is not feeling confused or left behind. Colours and slow-motion, among other special effects, are used to create sequences that may read as ""ridiculous"" on paper but are visually fantastic.

A masterpiece in writing, acting, and visuals - 10/10.

This movie shortly is messed up as me and the world is, I dont know I never felt like this before but I felt 1st time in my life movie with my soul. Something like that happened few times for me before but this time, it felt something life first love but watching this strange movie. Ah whatever, im trying to say something but no idea how to express this feeling. This movie is beautiful, funny and epic. PURE PERFECTION!!!

Just watch it, its silly, looks stupid and banal for brain off watching but its different if you read it deeply. Maybe im to drunk or whatever, but this movie is Perfection!

27 September 2022,I created my IMDb just to give 10/10,"This movie was absolutely fantastic.

The comedic aspect was absolutely nailed, it kept the movie feel very light and funny while having actually quite deep message.

The plot was well thought through and made perfect sense (even while being crazy) which is very rare to see in modern movies, especially comedic ones. The characters seemed very natural and fitting, nothing felt forced in any way.

My personal taste is that I usually don't like comedy movies from China because they tend to be over the top crazy and not make that much sense but this one really changed my opinion. It is crazy, yes, but in a good way, I would say really on the line of being too crazy but not yet. Most importantly the plot wasn't hurt by the craziness in any way so it is still briliant movie story-wise.

As critical as I usually am to movies, I am honestly giving this movie 10/10 and ranking it among my Top 5 movies while being the Top 2022 movie (and I watch a lot of movies).",10
13 March 2023,"Well, I don't get it","I didn't enjoy the movie, mainly because I didn't understand the plot. Well, I kinda get it but it is really stupid to the extend that I wouldn't believe that this is the plot so I must be not understanding it And usually I could enjoy a movie even though I don't fully understand the plot if it is pure action or comedy but in this case I even didn't enjoy the action. The movie is not funny neither nor horror nor thriller nor erotic.

I just wasted what it seemed like a year of my life watching it Is this the naked king syndrome?

It might be political to nominate that movie all these Oscars, who knows. May be because the other movies weren't that great I mean what did Jamie lee Curtis actually do to get an Oscar.

7 October 2022,The best film of 2022 so far.,"This film is everything.

It's Ejzenstejn, it's Kubrick, it's Godard, it's Fellini, it's Wong Kar-wai, it's Kurosawa, it's Kobayashi, it's Lucas, it's Spielberg, it's the Wachowski sisters, it's Anno, it's Miyazaki, it's Kon, it's Bong Joon-ho, it's Wright, it's Nolan, it's Tarantino.

It's Daniel Kwan, it's Daniel Scheinert.

And it's also Marvel, but better.

It's really the film about the multiverse, the one of the weight of choices.

Through such an absurd and surreal story, life is told in its most realistic nuances.

Through the regret of not having lived a life that for a single, different deviation does not belong to us.

Believing that absolute nothingness, being stone, is the solution. A simple and appetizing solution, like the Bagel.

The absolute nothing to avoid the suffering of appearances, or the frustration of our present.

Making the mistake of not being grateful for the here and now, the present, which along with feelings are the only things that matter.

You just need to be kind in this life or in the other one.

It's the only way.

One of the most beautiful and important experiences of my life.",10
3 August 2022,9.4/10,"Just to start this off I want to say that this is for sure the best movie of 2022, I have two problems with this movie one of them being the beginning starts off a bit slow but it was quickly paced much better. The cinemaphotography is amazing, comedy was great and perfectly timed, and the action scenes were near perfect. The actors were chosen well but the character writing made the movie 10x better. The plot was tackled beautifully, almost better form than an NFL player. Another complaint was the ending was a tiny bit drawn out and they should've ended it right when they hugged before all the sentimental talking, but of course it is my opinion and you are entitled to your own. 9.4/10, a24 did an amazing job once again.

17 April 2022,"Troubling but passionate, existential in its message","I found this film to be very anti or strange in its message. It evolves around nihilism or at least existentialism on how nothing matters but we still choose kindness in the midst of 'not having all the answers.' This type of thought leads me to believe that the film makers believe in a worldview of 'nothing matters' which irked me as I don't believe in the same way.

I think that we should choose love and kindness because we do matter and life does matter and the choices we make have lasting effects on higher powers or a God in place. It's a disappointing final message and I wish no one would come to appreciate or believe in its nihilistic approach, it's devastating.

The film is original, masterful, perfectly edited and incredibly engaging. It's an acid trip and it feels as if you're exploring through many different portals of life. It's grand and I believe its a mind dazzling, complicated and pretty fun experience. I can't give it a higher score because I'm saddened by its poor depiction on life and how we should value it. I just wish this film wasn't a message to allow more LGBTQ privilege to flood through our heads thinking that's okay.

In summary, it's a film about human liberalism and the allowance of mutual sin and spreading sin, it's about universal love but it's human centred and it idolizes our place infront of God. The reason I'm being religious is because the film explores so many ideas of life and the meaning of it. As a Christian I don't believe life is meaningless and I don't believe that lesbian gay rights should be pushed ever so bluntly they did here. I believe that life is full of grace, and lesbians should have equal rights but not in the way of outright blasphemy of Christian tradition. It's this kind of liberalism which angers me because if you don't have a fear of God, you'll unleash human anger and rage everywhere.

Instead of being kind because life is meaningless which is a stupid message, think about how God loves us so much and made you so valuable and you are loved no matter what race, status or sexuality, so then be loving and kind because we are all eternal people and we shouldn't misplace the love and message of Christianity for something trippy, ethereal and demonic.",10

29 November 2022,A movie that is a visceral experience in a cognitive shell and it works,"This more than 2 hour movie is the length of a War and Peace novel. Many of the actors are recognizable from other roles and are true dynamos and professionals in their field. The movie initally appears quite disjointed and confusing but as it progresses the emotional connection takes over and the inticacies of each character in each timeline becomes part of the whole and one processes it as such. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. Truly excellent! Michelle Yeoh as the main character is a ""shape shifter"" in the sense that she can change her demeanor and physical actions as she progresses on her journey. James Hong seems to have been around for ever as an actor and he adds a familiar face to the scene which incorporates drama and comedy in a seamless fashion always taking you to another level. Jamie Lee Curtis is magnificent in a role that you would never expect her to play yet she pulls it off with a memorable performance. Ke Huy Quan who plays the husband from different timelines also brings a believability to the movie and Stephanie Ann Hsu who plays the daughter is able to morph personality and bring shock and awe to the situation.

I'm struggling to find anything else to say to be honest as i need a certain number of characters to post this and a 5 is generous, it was not for me, it was trying to be serious an silly at the same time an left me not caring at all, but hey, other people seemed to like it from the overall score so make up your own mind. My review is still short so ill add i cringed at getting a papercut and Jamie Lee Curtis is fab as always. Had to skip 10 seconds to fast forward many times in this, a silly mess of nonsensical drivel.

19 July 2022,Mostly Amazing,"There were times when the human got a little too silly, and even gross. I could have done without the sausage fingers or the fight scene with the trophies, for instance.

If it weren't for those bits, this would have been a 10, but it took me out of the deep thoughts and major feels. My wife thought it was disgusting and wanted to stop watching a movie that she otherwise enjoyed.

13 March 2023,"""Everything everywhere all at once"" is a great example of movie playing with ramifiend timeline concept while being story about importance of love in us.","""Everything everywhere all at once"" is a great example of movie playing with ramifiend timeline concept while being story about importance of love in us.

The movie introduces concept of traveling through different life scenarios that vary by any, even smallest decisions. Unlike typical blockbusters, this work uses it not to create a plot, rather to highlight problems and challenges characters already had.

The main idea and concept is all kinds of love: love in family, to the stranger and to the partner. With that being covered, almost every aspect of love finds its place here too: lack of love, struggle to show love, need to get one and so on.

It's gorgeous movie that doesn't have weaknesses, covers the topic and takes viewer to an exciting journey which easily deserves 9/10.",9
25 June 2022,I had a lot of fun watching this,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

12 February 2023,Drop Acid Before You Sit Down To Watch,"Would be one way to watch this movie then again dropping acid as I remember slows time down and this was long enough.

Rather difficult to watch to say the least but a gold star for originality.

It will not everyone's cup of tea as you will see in the reviews but if you are looking for something totally out there and like the idea of an experimental experience at the movies give it a shot.

When the final credits did role I was thankful yet smiling, I do not think the reviews do the film justice.

Yes the fight scenes are very ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" in there execution but that was all part of the fun in how the film was written.

This is a film that you should make an effort to go see just because it a film that is worth discussion as you are walking out of the theater.

If nothing else, one that will stand the test of time.",8
11 August 2022,"What a glorious, entertaining, profound and enjoyable mess!","I will be extremely short, I don't have too much time but I just wanted to tell people: just watch this movie. Nothing like this ever existed before, it is the most original movie I've watched in years of repetitive plots.

It also manages to be a movie that touches the LGTBQ+ in a purposeful way - and this is coming from someone who hates the recent wave of wokeness.

It's just a GREAT GREAT movie and super fun to watch.

Unfortunately it's not kid's friendly, although I can't wait my kids to be adult enough to watch it because it's too funny. :)

9 August 2022,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Pinkie Finger","Unlike Shunichir√¥ Miki's wild passion project Asatte no mori (2011) that was perhaps produced just for his personal viewing and a select few film festivals. EEATO is just as bonkers, but it's clear in its objective, and was made for everyone. This film deserves it's own rollercoaster at a theme park. Crazy it is 140mins long.. I can't remember taking a breath. It's as original and clever as you can get in 2022. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Pinkie Finger. Just give me Ke Huy Quan young or old, all at once.

28 April 2023,Mix of misunderstood ideas,"I watched the movie because of recommendation and the many awards it won and am left truly astonished and puzzled. For me the movie was a poor attempt to incorporate ideas as well as wisdom and emotion, ending up with a complete mess and complete lack of substance and depth. Watching teenage tantrum through the whole movie really made me think this is not a movie for adults. The scenes are not harmonious, the humor and originality attempts are simply not working, not at all. This movie was a complete waste of time for me. Long time I haven't watched something so overrated. I'm astonished that it has more awards than other much better movies.

10 May 2023,Worth checking out,"This movie, which claims to deal with the multiverse, as the name suggests, but uses this factor to create a truly moving and entertaining story to watch for 2 hours and 20 minutes. The multiverse has been explored on the cinema screens for a few years now, but this may have been the first to show it with mastery. From the performances (which also won an Oscar) to the direction of the scenes.

A movie that can be watched with family, with a comedic tone at certain moments and a really cool message to be conveyed. A movie that is definitely worth watching.

Despite all of this, I don't think it's super innovative, as some reviews suggest, being something outside the box. It's just good at what it set out to do.

8 January 2023,Remarkable once you get the rhythm of it,"At first I was thrown off by the frenetic pace, but once I understood and settled into the rhythm I appreciated where the film was taking me. It touches on many issues such as family estrangement, the plight of immigrants who struggle with the rules & laws of their adopted country, and in particular how we view and judge our past choices and contemplate ""what ifs"". This is not the film for when you want something easy and relaxing. It's a wild ride with a purpose and an ultimately satisfying ending. Congrats to Michelle Yeoh who still has her martial arts chops and all the supporting cast (shoutout to Stephanie Hsu). I recommend this to those viewers looking for an adventure and willing to put up with a little confusion until the movie reveals itself.

1 June 2022,Imaginative Fast Paced Multiversal Drama,"Very ambitious multiversal drama. I honestly was not expecting this movie to be built around a family delivered through a multiverse of astounding scenes and imagery but I was pleasantly surprised and intrigued by it. Particularly impressed by the brilliant Michelle Yeoh and the underhyped performance of Ke Huy Quan.

However, considering the high standards the movie sets for itself - despite the brilliance of its characters, how the story is told, and how the movie's plot unfolds, and - if Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is perceived as the fast-paced drama it is albeit set across a multiverse: The movie underdelivers. To be clear, yes, the movie borrows a lot from multiple genres but at its core it is mostly a drama.

In that light, it struggles to provide sufficient emotional fulfillment by the end of the movie and all the brilliance of the movie's methodology amounts to little. It also fails to deliver anything new or unique to match its multiversal ambitions, undermining its brilliance with a bagel. Point being: The movie shows that it can tell its story across a multiverse but ultimately does not prove that it has a reason to do so.

Also, while Stephanie Hsu was good for the most part, I think she perhaps lacked a functional range to portray the varieties of her character. Thus contributing to the emotional gap at the end of the movie.

Overall, it's a mostly superb movie, seriously original and put together with Oscar worthy editing. If there was one Oscar this movie would easily win, it would have to be for the editing work.",8

15 April 2022,HIGHLY Recommend,"I don't normally write reviews, but this movie was something else. All biases aside, I think this film is special in so many ways. It nails almost everything you want in a film. From the cinematography to the visuals, and even to the acting it was top notch. It depicted what could be so well. The notion that we live in alternate realities, and can change all of them was extremely well done. I really hope this film gets the admiration and accolades that it deserves.

17 April 2022,A masterpiece,"Behind the absurdity and chaos at the surface of this film is a beautiful story about a family's desire to connect. The acting performances are spot on and the attention to detail is incredible. I think I experienced every emotion while watching this movie. I've never seen such bold concepts portrayed in such an abstract way while staying so accessible. This is a must watch, and in my opinion, a true masterpiece.

30 April 2023,Not very good at all,"The film was a total mess of random activity. There was no memorable dialogue, it wasn't funny, it wasn't moving, it wasn't thought provoking, it wasn't even escapism. It really was just 2 hours of total randomness thrown into a film.

It seems this film was just another on the recent multiverse bandwagon. The only difference was that this wasn't a Marvell superhero one. It doesn't make it clever though. How it won anything at the Oscars leaves me absolutely baffled.

There's not much more to say about this film other than, my advise is to avoid it and save your precious life hours for something else.

1 star for decent acting + 1 for some quite nice colours.

11 May 2022,it really is everything everywhere all at once,"If you're reading this before seeing the film, go in as blind as possible. You *need* to see this movie. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make a confusing arrangement of both come out of you at the same time. It will feel personally tailored to do this to YOU ALONE. It contains a little of every story, every conflict, every problem you yourself are facing, and addresses all of them from a place of empathy and love.

Don't expect anything specific. It won't matter, though. You won't expect any of it. I've seen this film 4 times, once in Finnish, and each time it made me cry in a different way for different reasons. It will require multiple viewings, and it will feel like about 20 movies at once. And it is. It's a beautiful amalgam of so, so, much. It's a story about a laundromat owner doing her taxes. And much, much more.

This is a beautiful film. It's the best film i've ever seen. In addition to the important emotional stuff, it's also a pretty movie, with wonderful cinematography, lighting choices, vfx, all that stuff. That's not why you'll watch it so many times, though. You'll be peeling back layers, both of the film and of yourself, learning more and more about how to live empathetically and be the best possible version of yourself (or, as it may be, live with being the worst). You will find yourself in this film. And it knows that. Knows you. Let it in.",10
20 April 2022,EVERYONE MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE,"Just go see it. I cried so much but left so happy. An amazing funny deep moving emotional weird hilarious film. I'm telling everyone I know to go see it. I'm about to go watch it again in theaters.

2 September 2022,"Laugh, Cried and a beautiful narrative","I do genuinely believe any bad reviews this movie gets is from the kind of people who loose focus when talking to their friends/mothers/partners. What we had here is a beautifully executed incredibly well made movie that feels completely fresh and unique that explores themes of love, kindness, adolescentce and adversity.

The introduction of concepts and characters were well written and done in a way to make the most sense to the audience as possible. A well trodden line between exposition and spoon feeding the audience.

TLDR; Cried three times, laughed a bunch. The actors were vesitile and fresh. Well done.

21 September 2022,Best movie ever made,"Some people will laugh and ignore this movie, others will simply call it best movie ever made.

I haven't done research on the ""Daniels"" but they might have tapped into something profound here.

There are way too many references to the mystics and eastern spiritual philosofies. Like ""Mr Nobody"" the movie puts the viewer in whats like to be in the 5th plane where we are not prisioners of time instead we have access to timelines, but goes beyound reaching the 6th (choices) and 7th (physical properties), ultimately lands in the realm of empathy and compassion through understanding of others perspectives to prevail in unity of the present moment.

There are many alternative lives out there but them all find beauty in the simple things.",10
22 May 2023,The title resume everything,"The movie title literary resume everything, both in it form and content.

Everything everywhere all at once will be an iconic movie for this generation just like the graduate was for the older one.

First, It carry important messages, such as depression, the meaning of the life we live in etc.. it really hit late millennials and early gen z. In a world where everything fall apart it's hard to take place and find goals that make sense, it's hard for us to leave a print where everything and anything has already been made. (up to you to interpret the others) also it's the best meaning of ""it's bad to be bad"" because it said that if nothing matter, nothing count then why lost your time to be something else than being good?, It's not naive to be optimistic, it's vital and strategic.

The movie in is absurdity is incredibly well because the absurdity make sense and it's important for the story, that's why it works and also because there is no side character to remind us that it's not normal. This is the key to make absurdity work. This comics scenes was also taken really seriously during the shooting of this film and was meticulously thinked, exactly like a ""normal"" one they wasn't acting like ""it's funny and absurd so it's okay if it's a mess"".

The actors choice is perfect, sound design, perfect. And I would like to salute the video montage team because it must have been hard to build up this movie but they did it extremely well.

Im sorry if my critics hits all topics quite randomly but it's hard to give a correctly build advice when this movie put your mind in everything everywhere all at once...",8
21 June 2022,The best movie I have ever seen,"The title is not hyperbole. I don't think anything tops this masterpiece. Art films get too boring, and blockbusters get lazy. This is maybe the most entertaining but excellently written movie that I'll ever see. The humor is great, combining both slapstick and observational comedy. The action scenes are just standalone masterpieces. The cinematography is just refreshingly good. But I wanted to basically talk about two things here, the acting and the message.

First, the cast is just plain awesome. Everybody has already heaped praise on Michelle Yeoh's outstanding performance, but I was more engrossed in Stephanie Hsu's Joy. She has easily secured her place as the best antagonist I've ever watched. Not only is she brilliantly written and acted, I just found her way too relatable. She is maybe one of the best teenage/Gen Z antagonists I have seen, and I was honestly rooting for her the entire movie. Also, they make a very adorable couple(her and Becky).

Finally, the message. The movie does something most movies don't even think about. It works hard to resolve it's conflict, which is basically existentialism. It somehow manages to put a optimistic spin on such a nihilistic concept, and makes it satisfying.

Also, this movie made me laugh and cry with just two rocks. No dialogue, no music, just two rocks at the edge of a cliff. So if you haven't watched this yet, just go see it. Pirate it, buy it, idc, just see it.

This is the true Multiverse of Madness. The 1 minute shot of Evelyn across thousands of multiverses is the best shot in entertainment history. THE BEST!",10
6 April 2023,"A blend of ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Terminator"" and ""Sanford &Son""","Title says it all.

I feel that you have to watch this movie twice to appreciate the full mastery of this movie.

First time watching it I was having difficulties following the story line.

(Editors had a major job putting this film together)

Full of twists and turns...... but stick with it.

Second time, It blew me away.

Jamie Lee Curtis pulled off a great character.

Michelle Yeoh jumped from so many roles.

Ke Hu Quan kept things connected Stephanie Hu and all others were instrumental to the film.

It was great to see legendary James Hong in this movie.

He always been an extraordinary actor.",9
3 June 2022,Surreal action-comedy,"I hardly know what to think about this. It was surreal, it was science fiction with time travel, it was a martial arts film in the comedic style of Jackie Chan, it was a romance, it was a story about a mother and daughter. I liked the film, but I didn't always know what was going on. I cared about the characters (in some timelines) and wanted things to work out well for them.

One complaint I have is that the science fiction part is never resolved. People from the future(?) or at least a different timeline are trying to get Evelyn to help them, and they are important in the first part of the film but not later. That part of the story just ends, and maybe we're supposed to conclude that their timeline is fixed by what happens to Evelyn, but I would have liked more clarity on that.

It did not go out so I got up and left the room with the rest of my family watching I mean three dogs watching. Speaking of dogs, this is a pile of heaping steaming crud. Horrible.

Do you want to be so bored that you are writing a review of the movie when it is only half over, then join the club because that's what I'm doing. No story, no plot, pointless, just a huge disappointment after watching the awards show last night. All quiet on the Western front was the best movie of all of them. Someone hand me a fork I want to stick it in my ear to end this pain. Thank you to the Academy ! Not.

From the first minute it hooked me and it just keeps getting better and better. I feel interested and mesmerized each time. I love the incredible acting of each of the cast especially the daughter and the father.

I just don't like some of the sexual jokes as it felt off. The movie also should have been shorter. The movie dragged on near the end and my enthusiasm since the beginning of the movie vanished.

Overall it was an amazing experience. Amazing visual effects and I'm glad that it didn't flop at the box office.

Rarely but yet luckily for cinema enthusiasts there is a movie that keeps your attention attached to the screen 100%. Such a well done and great movie.

Once again Michelle Yeoh proved that she has a great bandwidth as an actress.

Stephanie Hsu is a very promising in this movie, loved her costumes.

30 January 2023,Hysterical,"I love it when a writer takes an idea, considers the many and varied consequences of it and weaves a story around it that captures the imagination of its audiences and forces you to watch it through to a conclusion

For me that's what Everything Everywhere, All at once does.

When you can get over the absurdity of the premise, which is served up piecemeal as the seemingly banal scenario of a failing launderette plays out in the beginning you'll be rewarded by the beauty of its execution, the hysterical outcomes and finally, the deep, deep, deeeep phylosophy its grounded in

Absolutely brilliant.

The cast was amazing and so was the acting, i'm not surprised they won so many things at the oscars. I'd give this movie a chance if you were looking for what movie to watch, im very aware of all the bad things people have to say about it but if you aren't the type of person that takes these types of things super serious then i think it's a great idea for you to take a chance on it.

Just, WOW.

Really didn't see this coming, what a fantastic movie, with a extremely beautiful message. Spent the first half laughing, the last minutes criyng, and ended up realizing how beautiful the most simples things in life can be.

Very well directed, acted and with great special effects.

To top it all it succeeds to give a excelent and simple explanation to the multi-universe concept, in a way that i have to call it a must watch before you watch any movies with that thematic (and there are a LOT this days).

Don't get me wrong, the few and far between fights are I admit, very good. But the rest of the movie just gets more and more confusing and senseless as it goes on. Not to mention the more adult moments that made me feel uncomfortable sitting with my kids. I struggled through to the end, but it leaves me feeling very disappointed and empty. I found it so daft and dull that it actually depressed me. At over 2 hours long, it felt like an eternity. It's like a psychotic love child of Christopher Nolan and the Watchowski's. And what's with the sausage fingers ? No, this is not for me.

10 December 2022,"After careful consideration, this is the best film of all time","After having watched it multiple times and thought about it for months, this is my conclusion: Everything Everywhere All At Once is the best film of all time. Cinema peaked right here.

Every turn is unexpected, the script is original, the cast is perfect. One moment you're almost dying from laughter, and the next, from emotional pain. The final message, however, somehow seems to have permanently boosted my well-being and happiness in life. Safe to say I have never had a similar experience in the cinema, and certainly, no movie has ever stayed with me like this. Deserves every possible Oscar next year!

The name of the movie fits perfectly with everything the movie throws at you. The actors gave everything they had in them for this movie. The effects, scenery and camera posistions are all brilliant in terms of everything that is happening throughout the movie.

Personally I think there was a bit too much fighting scenes and the comedy choice isn't my type of commedy. Also way to much slow motion and use of music etc... however, that's just my opinion and I won't let that interfer with the movie itself, like many do in their reviews.

Not every movie needs a structure, just like evry song dosen't need a structure. Do you know why old music and movies were generally ""better"" than newer movies and music? It's because everything was original and new. Nowdays almost every movie and song tries to stick with these rules, guidelines and structure etc which leads to everything feeling THE SAME. That's why the older we get the less we can take of the pop songs that the younger people seems to love. All I knew when going into this movie was that it had something to do with multiple universes, and so much happend throughout the movie and I was unable to predict the majority of scenes and if that's not a good thing then I don't know what is?! The underlying meaning I felt after the movie actually hit me and I feel like it was the point from the directors and writers as well cause those parts of the movie had the longest scenes. I'm talking about everyday feelings that I'm sure 99% of humans will feel at least once in their life, which is wondering what their lives would/could have been like and what lives they want/wish they had. Especially impactful in the world we live in today were people literally have access to everyone, everywhere all at once through their phones and computers, young and old minds seeing both poor and rich people everyday all across the globe... the movie has moments where two completely different realities want what the other reality has, something that is also true in the world we live in. So many wanna be famous and many are jealous of the rich and famous and yet so many of the rich and famous are jealous of the people living normal lives... it goes both ways and every person on this planet has ups and downs and moments were they question their lives and everything that they wish or could go differently. This is not a bad movie and Ive seen reviews by people with thousands of ratings giving this a 1 star and I can't belive it... unless you are a fan of slow pased black and white jazz movies I highly recommend that you give this movie a shot.",9
29 May 2022,All over the place but I liked it. :),"It's a very thought provoking original movie and for much of it - I don't really understand what is going on with the multiple universes and where the plot is all going.

You are somewhat just as deeply confused as the protagonist yet at the same time, that is what is so amazing about this movie. It makes you both confused yet engaged with the movie every step of the way in a beautifully emotional yet ego-confronting , and at times, humourous way.

Some of the fight scenes are fairly funny and odd. It reminds me of a classic (life reflecting) supernatural film where it takes somewhat supernatural powers and experiences, for one to learn ab ultimate fact about life. I find this movie both well made, with obviously high quality production for the elaborate special effects and the plot is so original, that it's out of this world. I really enjoyed watching this from beginning to the end, and glad to have seen it.",9
26 June 2022,"The real ""Multiverse of Madness""","I've been watch those two ""Multiverse"" genre movies and this one is the true multiverse of madness. Visually pleasing, great acting from all actors, great concept, great choreography, simple yet great storyline, packed in one of the greatest movie ever made.

It's like a huge portion of sandwich, but they didn't put with what it left, THEY PUT EVERYTHING WITH WHAT THEY HAVE yet still managed to make it look like sandwich and taste like a good sandwich.

The multiverse itself might be a huge distraction for a simple storyline, but it's the essential part to make a great world building unlike *cough* Strange *cough* that's just passing by and gone.

Overall, best movie in 2022.

14 June 2022,"most overrated movie of the decade, so far","After about 50 minutes I walked out of the theater, wondering how anybody can watch this movie, understand it and even like it! I couldn't.

It's like listening to an 33rpm record played on 45rpm.

I didn't found a deeper layer, some seem to have noticed. I didn't saw a moving story, beautiful told. Maybe it's me, but to my account, this is the very most overrated movie of this decade already.

However, if you like standing on a train station, watching trains go by, very fast and quickly, one after another, then maybe this movie is for you.

1 June 2022,Amazingly creative and wierd movie.,"It's obvious that the movie's themes resonate with a lot of people - lost opportunities in life, bad choices, wanting to change everything, or destroy it all.

I didn't relate to a lot of those themes personally, since these days I basically just go with OK, this is what you got into, so how do you move on from here? Yeah, there was a period where I looked back and reflected on a lot of things and how they could have been better, but whatever, time to move on now.

Anyway, I do respect what the movie was trying to say, as chaotic as it was presented. The flipping around between multiverses reminded me most of ""Cloud Atlas"", but magnified tenfold.

10 July 2022,What a movie,"I was expecting a good movie, my friends were telling me it was good, so I went to the movies and...my man. It's not just ""good"". I have no word, maybe spectacular but that forms fit either. The plot is intense, it's funny but very mind blowing all the time. In my opinion it's the best move of the year so far. If anyone is in doubt to see it, just go for it, you'll love.

23 June 2022,One of the few things I would give a 10,"First off, i wouldn't call this movie full 10/10, but I would lean closer to a 10 than 9, so I rounded up. This film is hilarious, absurd, heartfelt, and visually stunning. This movie has such a strong sense of creative direction that it truly stunned me. One of the most original films ever made and I enjoyed every second of it. I hate to be one of those people who just gushes over a movie and calls it flawless, but this movie is near flawless. I found myself laughing constantly, but when the film wanted you to cry it made you cry. Highly recommend this movie and I doubt any film is going to top it this year.

6 July 2022,The Title Says It All!,"Imagine Kill Bill meets The Matrix. My eyes were glued to the amazing cinematography and Oscar award winning acting by the entire cast. This is hands down one of my top 10 movies of all time. Every single character has their own gift that they bring to the context of the story. Simply awesome movie, I'm still smiling after seeing it days ago.

15 March 2023,"Not the best movie ever, by a long shot","Everything everywhere all at once is incredible overrated, yes it is a good film but it's nothing special. Winning 7 oscars is insane and i really didn't care for any of the characters. It is a fantasy film but it just felt so stale for a while yet so many people say it was so tense and incredible. I really wish i could've gotten more out of this film judging by how much other people like it. I understand how important it is towards Asian cinema but if you want good asian cinema, just watch something like Yi yi, a much better and well acted film.

Tldr: Overrated, characters were not engaging for me and overall some acting performances weren't that good.

4 July 2022,Lunacy. Brilliant lunacy.,"At the heart of this film is a simple and fairly well-worn story about a mother (Michelle Yeoh) - she of conservative upbringing and strong work ethic - trying to understand her liberal and slightly rudderless daughter (Stephanie Hsu).

But how this story is told is a bit bonkers. The daughter manifests as an inter-dimensional being of unimaginable terror, bent on the destruction of the multiverse - and the mother is required to tap into the powers of her various alter egos from across the same multiverse in order to defeat her. Along the way we plumb the depths of the daughter's chaotic psyche and the writers' imaginations, as Yeoh taps into different universes featuring sausage-fingered humans, talking racoon chefs, robot grandfathers and a version of her movie star self. There are numerous homages to different movie genres, from fight scenes straight out of the Jackie Chan school of choreography to extensive comic-book superhero pastiches.

The concept is brilliant lunacy and the execution is almost flawless. Yeoh and Hsu are perfectly cast, Ke Huy Quan is a revelation as he switches apparently without effort between his completely bi-polar alter egos, and Jamie Lee Curtis is in equal parts terrifying and hilarious. Surprisingly, for a fantasy film, the cast is able to dictate proceedings without being dominated by CGI and special effects.

As is the way of cinema these days, the film is over-long and does drag slightly in the last quarter. But that doesn't undermine what is a funny, imaginative, thought-provoking and intelligent film.",9
15 March 2023,A poor man's Matrix - don't bother,"This is a poor man's 'Matrix meets Inception', and is not even as well thought out.

I knew it was in trouble when it was still setting up the premise of what was going on one hour into the film.

It certainly didn't deserve all the Oscars it got, and I can't understand why it has been so hyped.

Some of the visual effects are decent, but the film itself could be a low-budget B-movie.

Towards the mid-point, I didn't even care what was going on in the storyline. Nearer the end I was just waiting for the credits to roll.

I'm just glad I streamed it, instead of paying to see it in the cinema.

Very disappointing and nothing special.",2
21 April 2023,Best movie of 2022,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is a great movie. The directors Daniels done the great job with the writing and taking of the movie.

Everything Everywhere All at Once have the best visuals, best screenplay and Visual Effects.

Actors in this movie are best casting for their respective roles.

Music in this movie - good Performances of the Actors and Actress- great Visual Effects of the movie - great Story & Screenplay- great

Multiverse concept is best used in this story.

Best suitable TITLE for Everything Everywhere All at Once is Multiverse of The Madness.

Thank you for reading my review.",9
22 March 2023,A beautiful celebration of what it means to be alive,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",9
19 April 2022,Cinematic Masterpiece,"Once a decade, a film comes out that redefines cinema for that era. Everything Everywhere All At Once will be that film for the 2020s. The use of absurdist filmmaking is the perfect vehicle for addressing heavy themes like existential dread and generational trauma at a time when a film like this is needed more than ever. Not once does this film feel heavy-handed in its approach, but it also respects its subject matter and does not shy away from it. You'll belly laugh for half of this film and sob for the other. This beast of a film tackles its themes flawlessly and does not miss an emotional beat while simultaneously being a technical marvel. The performances, directing, editing, screenplay, sound, makeup and hairstyling, costume design, and score are all achievements of their own within this film. Everything about Everything Everywhere All At Once should not work on paper, but it does and it knocks it out of the park. All types of movie fans will find something to sink their teeth into with this film, there really is something for everyone. Go see this one in a packed theater, you might just walk out feeling like you experienced something transcendental with a bunch of strangers. Everything Everywhere All At Once is a warm hug to remind you that all of that everything might just be your superpower.",10
29 November 2022,This film is pure art,"This film is pure art. Michelle Yeoh is incredibly wonderful, and I believe she should be nominated for Best Actress for her portrayal. You will be amazed, you will chuckle, and you may even drop a tear or two. The action is also excellent. In a world when you believe you've seen it all, this utterly off the rails treasure shows you that there is still some creativity left in the world. Michelle Yeoh, the writers, the director, and the rest of the actors have a lot to be proud of with this film.

One of the oddest films to begin with, but the three-part act of everything everywhere at once is one of the most authentic, original, and heartfelt films of the year, if not ever. The supporting cast is fantastic, but no one can compete with Michelle Yeoh as the powerhouse that she is. As a sci-fi lover, it is unusual to come across such a mind-bending premise paired with such an emotionally gripping tale. I couldn't get a certain timeline- noir-esque, fuzzy, rainy- out of my thoughts for weeks after watching. Laundry doesn't seem so horrible now.",10
19 July 2022,Brilliant roller-coaster of emotions,"This one of these movies that explaining or trying would do just damage to whoever is watching it for the first time. Instead I will give the same advice that was given me, hold tight, pay attention, and you'll have a an amazing experience.

I read a couple of the bad reviews here and as expected they are mostly from people who could not understand some principles that might be important for a movie touching the multiverse topic. So if you are not familiar with it, or the idea of philosophy or even rejecting the reality we live in, you will have issues following the plot. There's no such thing as ""too silly"" to be possible kind of reality, our universe itself is as ridiculous as it can be, we would look just as silly from the perspective of minds from a universe where ppl walk upside down or just the fact the walk at all.

More importantly this movie send me to a journey through most emotions. It felt like action at times, suspense n horrors, but really a lot of really funny times filled the will of humans to feel complete and the power of loving and being resilient to the adversities of life.",10
22 April 2022,Amazing,"I could not praise this movie enough. It was original, intelligent, personal, moving, exciting and hilarious. I honestly see no flaws with it and would highly recommend you give it a watch. I would even go and say this movie can be life changing.

27 January 2023,Dumb and unwatchable,"I decided I finally needed to watch this movie after all the Oscar nominations it got. After 30 minutes, I almost caught myself falling asleep. After about 1 hour I turned it off. It was truly unwatchable. The movie (at least up until the point that I watched it) seems to have no plot at all. The multiverse theme seems to have been done without any proper theoretical backing or any philosophy behind it whatsoever. In any case, if there is any theory or philosophy, it's completely unintelligible. Everything indeeds happens everywhere, all at once, but I wouldn't say this is a good thing. Maybe I'm just not on the right drugs (no drugs at all) or I didn't understand the movie, but I highly doubt anyone will be able to explain it to me.

26 May 2022,Totally Random,"This is one of the best science fiction movies of this year. Unlike so many other mind bending movies(which I totally enjoy) they have tried to keep the concept very simple and easy to grasp. Direction is just amazing, be it fignting scenes or Psychedelic jumps between multiple realities. Every single person has done a fabulous acting, there isn't a single character that I didn't like. A must watch for all the science fiction fans, you will definitely enjoy it.

18 May 2022,Profound exploration of exsistence.,"Sorry it's kind of a long review I apologize in advance.

I'm not really sure how to get into explaining the deep thought put into the movie. The way I interpreted it may vary from your opinion of it. There are some parts that seem a little far fetched but the main idea behind the movie in my opinion more than makes up for the parts that seem to drift. It probably could have been delivered a little better in parts.

A little more in-depth on my idea of the meaning of the movie.

In my opinion the idea of the multiverse that exsists in this movie is something that differs from our current idea of the multiverse from Marvel as an example. I believe it's more of an idea of what you could have become had things been different in life and a way to connect with those lives, where things played out different. Just the idea behind that is intriguing to me.

Overall a movie I would recommend you watch. But also go into it with an open mind and allow yourself to enjoy it.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review....",9
25 April 2022,THANK YOU!,"Thank you for making this movie!! I haven't watched anything that touched me like this in a very long time!! One hell of an experience it was. After the movie ended nobody got up and left. The entire theater just sat there and let it sink for sometime. I felt like I came out of an intense therapy session feeling wonderful!!

A masterpiece!!

17 June 2023,Enjoyed it,"I enjoy watching movies and the characters was believable. The plot was relative and fun That the same time. The sounds, movies, voices and overall audio quality was good. The animations and effect was also quite nice. The directors did a good job and the editors also did a good job. The make-up was quite nicely done, not too much. The scenes was nicely setup and some interesting things to keep an eye out for. Overall this was a good movie I did enjoy it. The acting depends on how you look at it, on the one hand it can be seen through, but really emerging yourself in the movie makes it good. That is it!

Don't procrastinate amazing people.

12 March 2023,completly overrated - what a waste if time,"I really don't know why this film was hyped so much. The film is a seemingly never-ending martial arts composition with the pretence of somehow being a science fiction film. Maybe numerous people like the craziness, which, of course, could also be seen as an artistic achievement, but all the film really has to offer is a trivial, cheesy story that culminates in some nonsense and absurdities and, as I said, brutal fighting, fighting and again fighting. I waited a long time while watching the film for something to come along that would somehow captivate me, but nothing.

I have rarely struggled through a film as much as I did through this one, and it is probably the first and only film where I am completely at a loss as to why this film doesn't inspire me, despite the good reviews of others. Maybe I should have smoked a bit pot or taken acid to get some entertainment out of this never-ending nonsense ...

I found this film to be 140 minutes of wasted life (plus 5 Euro rental fee).",4
9 September 2022,You just know the Daniels are going to give us something unexpected,"I really enjoyed this and wasn't necesarily expecting too. A very clever film about our emotional pain and the power of kindness- I found it fantastic. The film touches on so many bases and had me thinking about it in the days to follow. You know the Daniels are going to give us something unexpected and incredibly entertaining. While I hear Awkwafina didn't make the final cut due to scheduling conflicts, the cast still boasts Michelle Yeoh, Jenny Slate, and Jamie Lee Curtis. So you just know there are going to be some comical moments as well as incredible fight scenes. And there are. Well worth checking out, I think one of the top ten indie films of recent time, without a doubt. Check it out and tell your friends- you and they won't regret it.

1 September 2022,Best Multiverse Movie I seen,"With the. Eccentric theme it gives important messages for modern life dillemmas. It is attainable to.make inferences like multiverse is sc fi of the post truth era, and movie delivers modeest view to deal with that mass. I think message was original and simple and not reluctant. Found myself in between mother and daughter (even I am man), it was not clear to which side is the appealing one.

It combines a lot of movies, and yet protects its originality love that.

The lgbt thing is not bothersome at this form (form that creates conflict not just normalization thing) . Another thing politically correct holywood movies makes a rule that no man can hit to any woman soo I cut one star because of that kept. Yet character growth is was well written.

17 April 2022,"Really, Just Everything","You would have to be a secret shifu to foresee that Evelyn, the middle-aged laundry woman, was about to be launched on a hero's journey arc in this kung fu-magical realism comedy. Everything, et.al. Is genius in defying expectations. Evelyn's is a journey of constant time leaps, martial arts spectacles, tasteless comedy, characters with alternating personalities, and uncountable weird planes of reality where our hero discovers and hones her unknown ability to master the multi-verse. Merging multi-genres, this unique movie has something for EVERYbody, sometimes to the point of exhaustion. By the end what glues the whole frantic mosaic together is its unexpectedly poignant message on the need to prioritize relationships and family.

It might change your perceptions of life, living, fade, family and relationship as it does to me. I love this movie so much, its a real master piece of art.

18 March 2023,Has everything,"Sums up life's pointlessness and why it's so precious, accompanied by thrilling pictures and seasoned with the salt and pepper of life - humour and play.

This Sci-fi movie presents a mind-boggling idea of a multiverse, puts everyday people in the center of it, which leads to a very everyday take on the big question of life: whats the point? If everything happens everywhere all at once all the time, why dont we just surrender to random and give up? A challenging question which through hilarious frames is being answered in the most everyday way I can imagine: You cherish what you have and seek the point yourself, in this case to practice love.

The story of love that stretches beyond time and space will never grow old to me. Give yourself a reminder on how to enjoy life while it lasts by watching this movie and remember: DON'T PANIC.

22 April 2022,"Really, really, really awful. And boring.","I think I spent at least 2 hours of the 2 hour and 20 minute movie wishing it would end, not wanting to say anything in case the people I was with were enjoying it. It is a giant mess, makes no sense, the sci-fi aspects are just dumb, the main character is almost likeable but no one else is, I felt like it must have been 4 hours long, but didn't want to look at my ticket or my phone to see the time so as not to annoy the people around me. The quality of effects and the acting are fine, but the story is just so near non-existent and stupid. I did think during the movie that the great reviews and ratings (the reason I chose it) were like an art critic praising a banana taped to a wall - because they don't want to admit the don't understand it - when there is nothing to understand. Staring at a banana taped to the wall would be about as boring, but not the same awful assault on the senses.

2 August 2022,Felt levitating watching it and had an amazing euphoric experience,"I am too lazy to write reviews on every good movie that I watch, but this one is the very few that deserves to write a review about. First off, this movie is a perfectly timed release; a blessing gift for the post-pandemic era. This movie was damn brilliant; one of the most unique, complex and beautifully crafted movies I've watched in a very long time. On a technical level, this movie is a masterpiece; I felt levitating watching it and had an amazing euphoric experience.

It has a phenomenal screenplay, embodies multiple genres and it balances everything. It was overwhelming from the beginning, moving, had a ridiculous twisting plot and it was terrific, beautiful, funny, emotional and deep with a perfect ending.

As soon as it ended, I told my movies buddy I needed to take a break to have it sink in before we talk about it. Then, we started talking and found it very complicated at the beginning but simple at the end, detailed and scattered at the beginning but wisely connecting the dots at the end and as we kept thinking, we soon noticed the depth of the message this movie conveys. It kept us engaged at every scene, we were laughing, we were crying, and thinking and it had incredible levels of emotions with some heart-warming moments. Michele Yeoh has delivered an Oscar-deserving act and the supporting cast has done an amazing job.

It is my top 2022 recommendation, go watch and you will thank me.",9
15 March 2023,Cried happy tears which has never happened to me,"This movie is truly original I haven't seen any movies like this and I think it's probably one of the greats of the decade with only Parasite coming to mind as potentially as good or better. A lot of the negative reviews seem to say it's hard to understand or pretentious, but I don't think either are true. I'm not going to say if you don't get it you are stupid because that's a stupid and rude thing to say, it is weird and has a lot going on but I think really if you focus on the partner and daughter relationships you'll recognise this as just a really sweet and sincere story about family. Which is also why I don't think it's pretentious it is far too sweet and caring a story to be pretentious.

25 April 2022,A Must,"It has been a while since I have come out of a cinema feeling different. I am always worried about any type of content that tries to tackle multi-verse or time travel because I feel like it often leads to paradoxes that disconnect you from the story. In Everything Everywhere All at Once I did not feel any of that, even though there are plenty of plot holes and inconsistencies to point out.

Part of it is, of course, the comedy aspect of the movie. But beneath this layer there's a very well told, and surprisingly consistent message of ""no self"". For me, it reminds me of 2 books combined, namely ""Man's Search for Meaning"" and ""No Self, No Problem"".

It is an incredibly powerful message, told in a very dorky yet incredibly effective way. I was hooked from start to finish and I feel like the movie's message will linger in my mind forever. I feel humbled and empowered at the same time.

5 April 2023,Everything Awesome In One Place...,"The most original, intelligent, inspiring and beautifully crafted / acted film I have seen in 20 years.

It deserved all the Oscars that it got and more besides. This is a story that was as emotional as it was unexpected and it's hard to imagine that this could ever be emulated by the Daniels, although I'm excited to see what they come up with next.

Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan lead an impeccable cast, beautifully supported by Stephanie Hsu and Jamie Lee Curtis. We are treated to every genre under the sun that ultimately leads to a beautiful reflection on relationships and family. I'll never look at rocks the same way again....

11 December 2022,A Fever Dream on Acid...with a Crystal Meth Chaser,"If you've never experienced the mindblowing, sweat drenching, intensity and total derangement of a fever dream strap-in and look no further than this sphincter-puckering, multidimensional rollercoaster ride. The title says it all...but doesn't even scratch the surface. I literally had to hit pause to allow my head to catch up, my heart to slow down, and my bunghole not to give out. As crazy as it was watching this story the thought of writing it made me sick to my stomach. Few films dare to go this gigantic and manic. And when they do they rarely succeed. Not so of EEAO. It is disorientingly heartwarming. And it is a film you will never forget. But watch it with a friend. Not only will you need someone to grab onto, but because if watch it alone, you might not be able to convince yourself it wasn't just a dream.

26 April 2022,Finally something different,"While this movie has obvious references to other movies, it is fair to say it is quite unique and unlike anything seen before. It mixes many genres making it impossible to describe in one sentence.

Michelle yeoh's performance is great as well as the other actors in the movie.

To me, the movie is pretty much an instant classic but I can imagine that some people might not appreciate the level of crazyness (genius?) in this movie.

1 July 2022,Unbelievable,"I tried to watch this film despite being warned. Don't really know what to write here .... that's how bad, unfunny and poor this was. Who pays for something like this to get anywhere near close to being filmed, produced and released?

What a waste of time and money.

21 November 2022,Unexpectedly touching film.,"I watched the trailer months ago and thought it was interesting but that was it; ok, a sci-fi comedy with a twist, something different from Marvel/DC/Disney..., will watch it, then, sadly, I missed it on the theatre. Luckily, they put it on stream.

Never would had I thought this one was one of those films I'd treasure for the rest of my life.

At first (very quickly) it may be too strange and fast, but once you set your mind to its pace, it's a joyride.

Every performer is on point but Stephanie Hsu and Michelle Yeoh as main characters and Jamie Lee Curtis' supporting role are amazing. Very deep, touching, tender, funny deliveries.

Reading that the FXs were made by a small group of friends (9) including the Daniels (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, writers and directors) is astonishing and they learned through tutorials, impressive.

I imagine the script as a mixture of the Wachowskis, Terry Gilliam (edit: there's a photo of him and Yeoh together in his IMDB page, maybe in another universe, hahaha) and Charlie Kaufman; a total chaos that leads to something deep and beautiful.

It deserves to be re watched several times to get all the small details. Being a Wong Kar-wai fan I recognised the homage straight away, it made me cry.

This is the way, at least I, expect one of today movies industry's favorite topic to be treated, won't tell wich not to spoil anything, you'll find it. Seriously, with respect, with a sense, not just because it sells better or to catch up with some agenda.

I think in this case editor and cinematographer not should but MUST be credited right next to the writers/directors, incredible work.",10
22 May 2022,Almost unique,"No, 10 is not a wrong score...I would give it 11 if I could.

I cried, I laughed, I thought about my fathers death, I smiled because I have wonderful people in my life, felt love because of a wonderful woman in my life. It has nothing to with the movie but as a person with less emotion on the outside - this movie brought it all out of me. All my emotions simply spilled out.. I felt what actors and writers meant for me (audience) to feel it and felt a bit more...it really was everything, everywhere all at once.

Move is definately unique, worth the watch. I really can't say anything without spoiling it but for anyone that ever reads this review - enrichen your lives with a bit of silly with a side dish of what really matters in life.

23 May 2022,Absolutely mind blowing.,"I could easily reach the text limit talking about good EVERY single aspect of this film is, because it is absolutely brilliant in every aspect. It is beyond a visual treat (if intense in some of the flashing parts) that will have you in a trance like state of ""whoa"". The entire cast is incredibly strong as well and their character shifts are quite impressive.

As a huge film buff who has watched basically everything I can, about halfway through I was already placing it in my top 5, and after that mark, where the emotion and hope and fear of the writing all comes into play...just wow. I'm sure some of the more physical humor (dildos) won't be for everyone and the general wackyness of it all could put some off, but I was mesmerized by it. Never before have I gone from crying from a mixture of love/fear/sadness/hope/loneliness/togetherness ALL AT ONCE to laughing hard while the tears were still coming. This movie is an EXPERIENCE and not just a movie. Thank you to everyone involved for making this.

20 May 2022,"Hilarious, Heartfelt, Relatable, ALL AT ONCE!","A truly incredible piece. Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert absolutely knock it out of the park with superb writing and fantastic direction and action that is just bonkers enough to make sense and yet imaginative enough to keep you thoroughly entertained.

The movie is a fresh breath of air amongst the recently developing crowd of multiverse flicks. Never does it shy away from the weirdness or trying to offer complicated explanations which gives room to explore the core characters and the underlying story. This movie will leave you playing out your own What If scenarios in your head, and how the slightest decision can lead to drastic differences in life. Its not a new concept but never has it been explored from the perspective of a relatable story of an ordinary household with common problems which are very much at the heart of it all.

The performances explore the widest range of emotions I have ever seen. Michelle Yeoh gives a career best performance in the role of Evelyn, who is trying to be a good Wife, Mother, Daughter and laundromat owner. Trying to be Everywhere, do Everything all on her own which later ties very well into the multiverse concepts. This is a character she plays to perfection and in my humble opinion is definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination at the very least if not a win. The support cast Stephanie Hsu (Joy) also gives a well layered performance. She flushes out the nuances of being different in a conservative family very well and beautifully channels the frustrations. Ke Huy Quan is also a great support.

To sum it all up, the movie is Hilarious, Heartfelt and Relatable, ALL AT ONCE.",9
29 April 2022,Biggest Surprise since Parasite (at least),"This is the first time a movie has made me leave a review... and I've been on IMDB for more than 10 years (that alone means a lot).

This movie has it all: action, suspense, humor, emotion... everything! At the same time, the movie is so well written that I never felt ""helpless"" but was able to follow along well. The story is complex, but you are taken by the hand, so you never get lost.

I don't want to go into too much detail about the story, but you don't leave the theater with question marks (regarding plotholes).

Furthermore, the film scores with ingenious acting of all involved without exception and ingenious animation and sound.

I cried, laughed and completely lost myself in the film... the film made me think and I will certainly see it a few more times in the cinema.

This is cinema. This is art.

19 March 2023,Nonsensical Drivel,"If there is a message in this movie, it's beyond my ability to see it. I read numerous synopses and recaps, and the pseudo-intellectual explanations seem to be author's attempts to appear intelligent and aware. If you watch this movie with a preconceived opinion of what its 'message' is, you are likely to see it. There's so much going on, that I think you can probably see many 'messages' depending on what you expect. In other words, you can make anything you want out of this movie as it's such a mess of disjointed images and sounds as to be incoherent by the end. Definitely not my cup of tea. I imagine that opinions will be sharply divided on this movie. Viewers like me get nothing from the chaos, while others will see some deep meaning in it.

9 May 2023,Interesting novum based on Multiverse Theory,"The movie started off to be quite annoying to me frankly, but after watching for over half hour or so, the science fiction aspects of the movie start unveiling and it becomes very engaging from then on.

The actors have done a phenomenal job - especially the main leads. Comic sense and timing was excellent at a couple of scenes. I loved how different and refreshing it was to watch this - the storyline is really well written.

I also loved how inclusive the movie felt - it is the first time I have seen a normal looking girl to play such a critical character in a movie and I really appreciate that. Overall, highly recommend this movie to all science fiction lovers!

7 June 2022,This is how you do a Multiverse movie.,"Unlike the misleading titled movie Dr Strange, Multiverse of Madness which shows 3 different universes for any real length of time and shows some weak cameos for 5 mins or less.

This movie. THIS is how you do a Multiverse movie. You really believe and feel how infinite the multiverse is when the protagonist travels among different universes.

The story is compelling and honestly I haven't been this pleased with an action adventure movie in years. Check the movie out. The run time is a bit long but you never feel like the movie is dragging.

29 August 2022,I'm definitely going to watch this again!,"I saw this while I was on an airplane the other day and I loved it! There is so much to appreciate about it that I am not sure where to start. The visuals were incredible. The colors popped in every scene and were a lot of fun to look at. I heard they a lot of the effects were completed by only a few people who learned how to do them over zoom during this pandemic. It's so impressive. Not only was it fun visually, but it was also funny! I laughed so many times during it I will probably laugh again when I rewatch it. The performances were also fantastic with the standout being Ke Huy Quan. It's awesome to see him in a production such as this again and I hope he will appear in more films in the future. This is my favorite movie of 2022 so far and I think everyone should watch it if they are able to.

11 December 2022,Must be high to watch or worst movie ever,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

5 November 2022,I laughed; I cried; are you not entertained?,"It's a remarkable flick.

Cloud Atlas meets The Matrix meets The Fall meets Nietzsche meets existentialism.

A heady experience, fraught with the emptiness of being, punctuated often by absurdity, levity, playfulness, sorrow, compassion, and hope. You never get to wallow in the fact that nothing matters; you're having too much fun.

I realized long ago that anything is better than nothing.

This film imports a lot of meaning from familiar places, like the love between a mother and child (not questioning the ultimate meaninglessness of kin altruism), so it only skims lightly on the implications of nihilism, but it speaks to us in ways we can understand., and if nothing matters, then why not choose to smile about it? Your sadness is just another petulant mythology.

I choose to enjoy the ride. What a neat film to remind us all of the possibilities to experience, and the privilege that it is.",9
18 February 2023,Funny and entertaining!,"This is a very silly and entertaining tail. Its makes me wish that it had a sequel already. Get ready to shake your head and laugh, this movie is full of random silliness and non sequiturs. Good acting and a good script, i am very impressed, I haven't giggled this much in a long time. Most of the movie doesn't make sense yet it is highly entertaining and leaves you wanting more. Im not sure what inspired this film because it is really crazy yet well done. If this one is not nominated for an Oscar than they are crazy. I am impressed at how serious the actors are as they deliver the outrageous lines that have been written. This one is an instant classic and one of my personal facorites.

8 June 2022,"Heartwarming, Soothing, hilarious","Everything everywhere all at once is a unique film, blending kung fu action, science fiction, family drama, comedy and heavy existential dread all in one big pot of soup.

It explores some of the heaviest parts of the human experience like failure, unmet expectations, regret, the possibilities that we passed on, what we can and cannot control.

It tries to navigate the pain of living a seemingly unfulfilling life and the thought of ""what we could have been"" but it never gets boring or pretentious as it is always self aware and humorous.

Ultimately it is heartwarming feeling that you get when a film articulates so much of your worries and reminds you why what matters is what you have right now.

Also I cried for 45' watching it.",10
11 March 2023,Wow!!,"Just incredible movie!

Several bad reviews, not that i think they haters, I imaging their little brains can take that much of what went in to so much effort, thought, arrangements, development and art!!

Just feel sorry for them!

I will just post what other reviewer wrote!

Gbill-74877

""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""

If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.

Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.

The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.",10
19 April 2022,Top 5 favorite films of all time,"I absolutely loved watching a film that's as simple yet complex as this one. There's beauty in a film that caters for multiple audiences and their watch styles; for example, those who need a little more hand holding for the plot and those who don't. There are obvious themes like, love and navigating relationships with others and yourself, and concepts a little more subliminal / complex like the multiverse itself, chain reactions, life purpose. There's an insane amount of symbolism in this film worth thinking about. From the IRS (and the trophies...I won't spoilt it but) etc... I promise the trailers really don't clue you in to the film genuinely, I was totally taken for a ride in the best way possible. I was just a huge fan of Michelle and that was my main reason for going, so this was the most rewarding and unexpected experience. A film that had me crying, then laugh crying, to feeling changed! Surely you can find some some story line to relate to in this film. Refreshing to see a story like this when cinema seems slower at turning our original content anymore.

23 July 2023,How did it win 7 oscars?,"I wanted to throw up while watching this disgusting movie.

It stared off well, but the more I watched the more I wanted to gauge out my eyeballs after seeing the most disgusting scenes.

I understand they are meant to be comedic, but what the heck did I watch? Especially at the end when I saw them eating there hot dog fingers, I felt so sick I could vomit all my organs out.

I am rating this 3 stars of 3 reasons -

1) Although VFX is used for disgusting scenes, does not mean it is bad. In fact I was amazed finding out the VFX-team consisted of amateurs.

2) Acting is good. Weird, but good. The actors did a great job getting into their roles. All of them had to play multiple different versions of their characters, and they did it good.

3 Concept of the movie is good. The multiverse is presented well.

Regardless, I would not recommend to watch the movies for the following reasons -

1) It is stretched alot, most of the plot feels so out of place and just filler. Does not add to the characters or anything.

2) Plot is terrible, and the execution is worse. The plot is all over the place and most of the things just feels like a waste of time while watching.

3) The scenes are disgusting. All the fight scenes feel out of place. One simple word to describe it - YUCKY

4) Mainly because it is boring. Watch something else. Anything else

Also just a warning, do not eat food while watching this.",3

24 April 2022,Absolutely Amazing,"This movie is absolutely amazing. Watched it tonight with my friend and we were absolutely amazed at how perfect it was. It contains the perfect mix of comedy without undermining the serious tones and messages in the movie. It's a ride, and a very good one at that. Definitely one of my favorite, if not my new number one favorite, films I have ever seen. 10/10 would recommend, and I do recommend.

I hope that it receives the recognition that it deserves, this is truly a masterpiece.

9 February 2023,Simply amazing,"I've never had my entire family sobbing in a room together unless some unthinkable tragedy had just taken place - until Everything Everywhere All at Once came out.

This movie is a wonderful story about family, and family's expectations, told through an absolutely strange story. The performances were great, the script is amazing (don't listen to the haters), and the message came through clearly.

Plus who doesn't want to see Jaime Lee Curtis summon her inner Sumo-Wrestler??

Perfect blend of comedy/action/comedy-action/drama/visuals.

Overall I can't think of a better movie to come out of 2022. I was already a fan of A24, but now I'm a fanatic.

21 May 2022,Lost for Words,"I feel compelled to write a review after watching this. I am not going to be saying anything that hasn't already been said, but honestly, this is probably the best ever film I've seen in the past 10 years.

I laughed, I cried, I was entertained, I was sad and I was happy. It was a roller coaster of emotions and that is what separates good films and great films, something that makes you feel. I would understand why some would not like this because it will honestly be the strangest movie you'll ever watch, but for me thats what makes it better.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is a masterpiece that is WAY ahead of its time.

7 May 2023,Diverging and converging. Iconic,"The movie is an 8 for me.

It talks about self love and self harm, depression, how hard it is to accept love when you believe you don't deserve it, how difficult relationships are, and how we all try our best everyday.

Why an 8 and not a 10?

1) There's this moment when you think ""what am I watching!?"" which lasts a bit too much 2) Sometimes I wanted it to be close to the end as it felt like it was a 10-hour movie

However I loved the genius! The ability to talk about such topics in an unconventional way.

Iconic! One of those movies you want to keep on talking about.",8

29 December 2022,More than a Movie...,"Love the main actress Michelle Yeoh and this movie is Awesome.

An Action, Fantasy SciFi Comedy that blew my mind. The metaphors are mind bendingly charged. At times I needed to catch up to my brain, other times it was so ironically obvious. It has an artistic quality to it very few movies attempt... Thinking of ""Being John Malkovich"" or ""Crash"".

At times I laughed out load and others I cried long. A very powerful movie.

I watched this because Michelle was in it (I didn't expect it to be a Kung Fu flick). It had some chops but it is sooo much more than that. This is a thinking person's movie. A once in a decade awesome movie.

Michelle Yeoh is speculated to be an Oscar nominee (winner?).... this should extend to Ke Huy Quan and screenwriters, cinematography director.

Caveat... you'll either love it or not. If you think you might be liking it - stick with it... 10/10 for me.",10
20 May 2023,Holy sht was this a good movie,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I like how experimental it is. It's such an amazing film. The way everything is filmed and the way the story plays out. It also includes a nice at the end. This is a spectacular film that I have greatly enjoyed watching. The acting is amazing and I am very happy that some of the actors won Oscar's for this wonderful performance. This is a movie that I can watch time and time again and still find enjoyment in. It is a movie that will live with me forever. I am very glad I watched it and happy to recommend it to friends of mine or anyone who wants to watch a beautifully made movie.

13 August 2022,An Utterly Perfect Film,"This movie of genre bending madness is probably the most life changing movie I've ever seen. The visuals, beautiful, the score and sound design, fantastic, the acting, phenomenal, and by god the perfect writing. This is a movie that is utterly hilarious, with extraordinary action, and thematically it's one of if not the most beautiful film ever. It's messages about life are so powerful, that love and joy is the thing persevering throughout all universes, and that sometimes a meaningless life is what gives life meaning. It's not just about the meaning of life but also the meaning of living. It's acing the messiness of life and man it's just a perfect film. It is not for everyone I will say, it is dirty, fast paced, and very flashy. But nothing will takeaway from the fact that this movie is utterly amazing.

2 October 2022,An attack on philosophical nihlism,"""When I choose to see the good side of things, I'm not being naive. It's strategic and necessary.""

I believe this line carries the entire message of the movie - optimism does not equal naivity.

This movie does more than just giving us thrills and laughts. It also teaches us how we should think of our lives. You may believe that alternate universes do exist. You may think that our lives are pointless because we could have lived in any of these universes and lived through all the ups and downs. The movie tells you that you are wrong.

We humans possess a natural instinct to render positive meaning to what we sense. That is why everything we have experienced seems to be real. Think about dreams. When you are having a dream, you never realize that you are dreaming regardless of what you see inside the dream. It is this very instinct that makes life possible. We take our life seriously and try to make the best of it because we believe it to be positive, real, and worth-living, otherwise there is no way we can survive.

It does not really matter whether the world we live in is actually real. In a Matrix-sense way of thinking, we may all live in a virtual reality and everything we feel is nothing more than electrical signals in the brain. What matters is that even inside this virtual reality we can render meaning to our lives and treat it as if it is real. This is the persistence of the survival instinct - it drives us to secure the best ourcome in whatever circumstances we find ourselves. It is this spirit that makes us human beings.

20 June 2022,The Matrix on acid,"I'll keep this short at to the point without any spoilers.

The movie was so good it compelled me to write this review when I should be working, but this was good enough to impart a small reflection of this classic to be.

This movie is a work of genius, a true masterpiece with a brilliant core message of the power of imparting kindness over violence. Of listening and understanding our place in the cosmos.

The acting is flawless as is the casting. The visuals are absolutely mind blowing.

As my review title states, the movie reminded me in part of the Matrix but better and yes, on an acid trip. I loved the action scenes and the humor throughout. It would be cool if they created a 3D version as well, but it's not needed.

One of the best movies ever made in my opinion. Kudos to all involved. This is the pinnacle of cinema.",10
29 June 2023,An Ambitious Yet Disjointed Journey,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" starts off on a promising note, offering an intriguing premise that captivates the audience. However, as the film progresses, it transforms into a chaotic whirlwind, attempting to depict ""everything everywhere all at once"" in a manner that mirrors the confusion experienced by the protagonist and her daughter. While the initial setup held promise, the narrative soon loses its grip, leaving viewers struggling to comprehend the multitude of scenarios presented. The narration lacks the necessary clarity, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind various scenes and understand why events unfold as they do.

Despite its narrative shortcomings, the film benefits from convincing and above-par performances from its cast. The actors succeed in bringing authenticity to their roles, elevating the overall viewing experience. The direction also exhibits skill, with the filmmaker's ability to handle the complexity of the story and guide the actors effectively. However, even with these strengths, the story fails to maintain a tight hold on the audience's attention as the film progresses. Repetitiveness and a sense of endlessness start to seep in, detracting from the initial intrigue and preventing a fully satisfying experience.

""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" ventures into the comedy and sci-fi genres, with varying degrees of success. The comedic elements, unfortunately, fall below par, failing to deliver the expected laughs and lacking the impact needed to enhance the storytelling. On the other hand, the film manages to justify its inclusion in the sci-fi genre, exploring parallel universes and delving into thought-provoking concepts. However, the overall premise does not entirely convince, leaving some doubts lingering in the minds of the audience.

The film concludes with an ending that fails to convincingly resolve the chaos within the protagonist's mind or satisfy the audience's desire for closure. The overwhelming abundance of not-so-interesting sci-fi parallel universes contributes to a flat and unsatisfying conclusion. The ambitious nature of the film's concept, while commendable, ultimately becomes its downfall, as it struggles to maintain a cohesive narrative thread.

In conclusion, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" sets out on an ambitious and thought-provoking journey. Despite commendable performances and competent direction, the film falters in its execution, succumbing to confusion and a lack of narrative clarity. While the sci-fi elements are justified, the comedy falls short, and the story loses its grip, leaving the audience wanting for a more engaging and satisfying experience. With a promising start but a flat ending overshadowed by the abundance of parallel universes, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" receives a four-star rating.",4

25 May 2022,The best movie of the year,"""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on."" I guess that's the fervent hope of this movie, that if all people were kinder to other races, the world would be more loving! Asians are not bad, they are hardworking, they have suffered a lot, and they know how to cherish.

The worldview in the movie is shocking. This is really a movie with deep Buddhist thoughts. It is another Buddhist science fiction movie after The Matrix.

24 May 2022,"The people who get it, get it. The people who don't, don't.","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

23 October 2022,Now this is how cinema should be!,"Like it's own Chinese name: ""horses flying in the sky"". Which is a mandarin idiom that shows unlimited imaginations and absurdity, so is this film.

It's been a long time I had ever watch a film with like pure talent of imaginations, not just in settings or plot, but also in cinematography and the use of sound! After watching so many mainstream films nowdays, I had already forgot that cinema is actually a form of art. And this film, it shows us how creative cinema should be.

However, after the unlimited amount of hustle and bustle in the film, the main theme of the story root into the theme that most commonly talk, but everyone has been missing out in normal life: love.

The main character is a pure loser in the start of the film, in crisis of divorce with her husband, having a rebel daughter, a father who disappointed in her, and of course: unlimited amount of taxes.... If you ever live in this kind of world, you might be wonder what's it like to live in the other live, where you can make a different decision that might lead you to a better life.

But what if all you can do is just loving what you had now? Like take a good care to people surround you? Take a good look at the washing machines that you had been bothered to see everyday? Instead of wasting time to regret your decisions in life, which lead to a more regretful life.

This is definitely a film you should watch as early in your life as possible.",10
4 August 2022,"philosophically great, but partially a hard watch","So, as someone who is deeply interested in philosophical questions, questions of depression and anxiety, this film should have been perfect for me. It actually is, in terms of asking and answering the big questions of humanity: Where are we ? Who are we ? Are we alone ? How can we go through this ? Alone ? As a family ? What are feelings ?

I think the Daniels answer these question very easily, not cheeky at all, we are humans and we've got emotions, desires and wishes. It's what makes us human, our feelings, and we can live through these emotions and make connections to other people. It's how we can overcome anxiety, madness and desperation. It's a beautiful message and the film explores these themes with undeniable power and maturity.

In addition, the film is a great production, it has some of the best fighting scenes I've seen in recent years, strong acting by its lead cast. It comes with clever dialogue, with beautiful pictures (as I'm referring to two stones talking to one another right next to a cliff), costumes, design, special effects - it's all there. A beautiful piece of art - and that what it really is in the end - a piece of art.

But this piece of art comes with some cost. Really, I love the messages behind the movie. But I think that in the end it, of course, it can be an artwork, but it's also still a movie. And in-between all these multiverses, we sometimes don't know where we are. Humans, or as I should say -especially myself - still have the desire to know where we are and to hold on to that world we are living in right now. The film floods you with pictures, images, changes, fights, explosions, madness. Of course, this whole thing here is madness, our life is absurd. But in the end I watched a movie of which I expected to be entertained. And I was entertained, but it felt stressful. Almost exhausting. It was just too much. The pacing was too fast in my opinion. I would've needed more time to take a deep breath and ask myself what the hell I just saw. I also feel that the 140 minutes are too much. Don't get me wrong. I liked this, but I didn't enjoy the watch as much as I did it with other masterpieces or artworks, because there is still an opportunity to create these kinds of movies AND deliver an easier watch.

I also want to mention, that I cried multiple times, especially in the end, where I think the film rewards the viewer brilliantly. But that reward was not enough in comparison to the demanding but also tiring parts in it.",8
9 February 2023,It really blows my mind,"This movie is a great masterpiece that offers a profound experience. It develops something wholly original and mind-blowing by breaking the rules of conventional filmmaking. You are always surprised and on the edge of your seat. The movie finishes with awe, making you wonder about your perception of life. You shouldn't miss it since it's engaging, thought-provoking, and an unforgettable experience. Everything Everywhere All at Oncenis a movie to make you feel, think, and just have a fantastic time. It's an opportunity of a lifetime that you won't forget long after the final credits have rolled.

27 March 2023,Not everyone get every thing all the time.,"I can see why you either loved it or hated it.

It either struck a cord with you and was the greatest thing ever, or you didn't get it and it was a chaotic mess.

I got it by its display of living with a nihilistic view, yet the importance of being kind and kindness being the only way forward when you don't know what is happening.

Maybe someone got it for another reason entirely.

However movies that take risks like this deserve the praise and if you don't get it now, circle back in a few years. Maybe you can feel the way I feel now after watching this masterpiece.

Maybe you will never get it, but get this, you are just a little dumb spec, we all are and nothing really matters, so just be nice if you are going to be anything.",10

3 June 2022,Emotionally drained after,"If you have any sort of bad relationship to your mom, I definitely recommend a watch. I don't think I've ever sobbed after a movie before, and I chose to watch it with my mom. Cried in her arms afterwards, just mumbling nonsense. 8/10 for me because of character related stuff, and some scenes I thought were out of place with the overall themes. But a good movie nonetheless.

11 January 2023,Simply Amazing storytelling,"In an age of comic book franchises, the art of filmmaking has taken a back seat. This movie is a return to unexpected storylines with glorious acting, humour, action and messaging.

Not only were the turns unexpected but totally worth it. A sequel would ruin it but I want a sequel. The lead actor playing different versions of herself from multiple universes reminded me somewhat of Jet Lee's the One but muchuchuch better. Costume was brilliant.

The next phase of this review is to somehow meet the criteria of six hundred words when I just want to say the movie was a brilliant breathe of fresh air.

22 March 2023,"A Heartfelt, Multiversal Roller Coaster of Emotions and Adventure","""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a masterfully crafted sci-fi comedy that takes a deeply relatable story of a family struggling with an impending divorce, tax debts, and a strained mother-daughter relationship, and turns it into a wildly imaginative adventure through multiple universes. The Daniels duo expertly weaves these seemingly disparate threads together, creating a cohesive and emotionally resonant narrative.

The film's unique blend of heart, humor, and mind-bending visuals offers a fresh take on the multiverse concept. Michelle Yeoh delivers a captivating performance as the beleaguered housewife, whose journey through the multiverse brings her face-to-face with the many facets of her own character. This exploration ultimately helps her to address the challenges in her life and mend her relationships.

""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a must-see for those seeking a cinematic experience that is equal parts entertaining, thought-provoking, and genuinely moving. This film is a testament to the power of storytelling, reminding us that even the most outlandish adventures can be rooted in universal themes of love, family, and self-discovery.",9
18 April 2022,Scott Pilgrim + Neo + Dr. Strange,"After taking Existentialism in high school, I would never have dreamed a movie about ""life is meaningless"" would have me laugh-crying at the end.

The genre bending of the Matrix mixed with the multiverse of Marvel and then layered with the most exquisite humor of Scott Pilgrim, this movie was incredible.

I cannot imagine how the screenwriter conveyed such absurd concepts (hot dog fingers, talking rocks, not to mention a beautiful raccoon riff) to a director who ""had a vision for what they wanted on the screen (?)"" who was able to get the actors to so convincingly amp up the nuanced acting as we flit back and forth to the same universes where the continuity manager's head must have popped. The white board for this concept must have dwarfed any previous movie and the editor had so many cuts that had to sync up. Just wow.

Hats off to the entire cast. Well done and beautiful. The ending was not at all what I expected and I cried (?) several times as it wrapped up. And the ratatouille references made me laugh. Thank you Hollywood for this one of a kind movie and Yeoh you are the best. I cannot believe a woman so versatile, beautiful, and physical can be in her sixties. You the best!",10
27 June 2022,A therapeutic psychedelic trip that might change you forever,"Honestly, I never write reviews for any films but this one might stay in my mind for a long time. This is what aliens should see if they come visit us, or what people will watch in 100 years from now to understand the origins of our culture. Being the closest I've ever experienced to a psychedelic trip, the film immortalizes how it feels to live right now, at this exact moment, in such an entropic world like ours. I have questioned countless times the meaning of life, been close to suicide, suffered from constant depressions, and wondered how life would be if I had chosen the other path, or any path at all. But nothing hits deeper than the sense of nothingness that comes up when you get a glimpse of all the alternate universes you could've experienced, which is also a real math principle given the infinite size of the one we live in. Everything, Everywhere, All at Once will relate to each of your life memories and draw a picture to the frightening feelings the anxious, unstoppable and unforgivable world has put you through, but to say CHILL, LOVE and DONT WORRY TOO MUCH. Because nothing matters, nothing can stop you. Nothing is too important to prevent you from enjoying this one shot you get that's called life.",10

With it all fit together quite seamlessly. Some people have to know everything that's coming next- a realism movie, but this is the opposite- completely unpredictable. It could be a dream. I also laughed many times at the unending imaginations involved here. A good movie, to see stoned. A clever cult classic. An actor's fun dream role.

19 September 2022,It's all about Michelle Yeoh,"While the movie is very fun, cutting 20 minutes and refraining from this overdose of dialogue and resolutions could have helped a lot. Some images would have been enough to explain - or make you feel - the multiverse and all its facets.

Truth is : ""Everything, everywhere, all at once"" is fantastic because of Michelle Yeoh. She shows an ability to habit emotions that you cannot rehearse, to frame silent emotions as if in her right true life, portraying a character who would not grasp the wild stakes of these events. She made me feel like truth was achievable by an actor with a very deep control of emotions. Her kung-fu education in martial arts surely is no stranger to that ability.

I don't think we will remember the movie as much in the future, but we will remember Michelle Yeoh. There is no Oscar night without her kicking Chris Rock on stage in 2023. And if she doesn't win then they haven't understood anything about acting.",8

This movie should be regarded as art. It is so well done as a comedy with a sincere message that had me nearly sobbing at the end. Movies don't make me cry.

I will forever cherish this movie and I recommend everyone give it a shot, even if the message doesn't come through to you, it's still a fun ride!

Great pacing, nothing felt like it was unnecessary, great concept by itself and ever better realization of it. I love that it's not only the adventure and jokes, but it's a mix of emotions. Love how you start to question things, how you watch the struggles of characters, how every single aspect of them matters a lot and they are all well written. The movie made me burst out laughing but also cry. A truly amazing experience.

19 February 2023,First time I disagree so much with the average rating!,"Worst movie I've ever watched! Yet, the average rating on imdb stands at 8.0. This is so surprising. I usually am not hard to be satisfied by movies, and I had always agreed broadly with the imdb average rating (by a point or 2 at most). But it's the first time I disagree so much with the imdb average, and with reviews in general. I really felt like I lost 2 hours and a half of my Saturday because of this movie. The message shared at the end is a message I agree with, the plot sounds interesting, the actors are amazing actors, and it's great to have some changes in the typical cast of Hollywood movies... but the movie's jokes and comedy scenes felt like they were aimed at teenagers (particularly a few scenes that I would definitely had laughed about with some of my friends when I was in high school). I would recommend to stay away from this movie, despite the amazing reviews you will find and the nominations it has received.

9 April 2023,Not just any movie. It's why I watch movies.,"Plenty of cynics today like to play this one angle, ""We can't make movies today like we used to!"" And to that I would retort, well there are plenty movies being made today that couldn't have even been imagined decades prior, for reasons of special effects capabilities and subject matter.

Here is a movie that falls into both categories.

A multiverse plot can be like a time travel plot. It can make your head spin. Our main character Evelyn, portrayed to perfection by Michelle Yeon, learns that much for herself in quite literally the most overwhelming manner possible, when she is suddenly sucked out of her mundane life by an alternate version of her husband who claims that the fate of all existence rests is in her hands. No pressure there.

It's as weird a movie as you can possibly imagine, which has become the trademark of the Daniels directors. What else can you expect when you are transported to realities where people have hot dogs for fingers, or rocks make up the human population, or where the physical laws of Pixar's ""Ratatouille"" are a thing?

But like ""Ratatouille"" taught us, ""the new needs friends."" This is the kind of movie that encourages you to push your levels of acceptance along with Evelyn herself.

If you can bring yourself to look beyond the nigh unfathomable chaos, you might see that it only serves to benefit Evelyn for the better.

It takes meeting an alternate version of Evelyn's husband Waymond, in a verse where they never married, to help her realize, maybe a lifetime of laundry and taxes isn't so bad if you're sharing it with someone special.

It takes encountering a dark, misguided version of Evelyn's daughter Joy to make her ponder, maybe I've been pushing her too hard as a mother.

After the most mind-bending and convoluted of trips, it all boils down to this one timeless reminder. How did that Kansas farm girl put it? Ah, yes.

""There's no place like home.""

What else can I even say about Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Stephanie Hsu, Jamie Lee Curtis, and of course James Hong that hasn't already been said by everyone else on Earth? They are all nothing short of phenomenal in every variation of their characters we see.

Ke Huy Quan, aka Short Round, shines like a star as Waymond after decades away from movies.

Stephanie Hsu as Joy shows fantastic range from joyful (no pun intended) to sinister. I look forward to seeing her in more stuff.

Jamie Lee Curtis...she's terrific as always.

And James Hong, of course, continues to be a legend.

From a technical standpoint, if you can believe it, only 5 people made up the bulk of the movie's post-production work. You read right. 5 people! At a time where major blockbusters have a small army of folks in the Post-Prod credits scroll. And yet this film actually stands out more visually and creativity next to the majority of them. Coupled with some of the most ludicrously bad-ass action sequences I can recall of late in cinema.

Impressive is not an adequate enough word.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is not just any movie. It's why I watch movies.

Its success makes me happy.

Its continuously growing following makes me happy.

It's best Picture win gave me the happiest surprise I had in ages at the Oscars.

And somewhere, in every verse, there's a variant of me being asked ""Are you Happy?"" And my alternate selves answer, ""well...movies like this definitely help.""

I can't wait to see it again.",9
3 December 2022,TRUE MASTERPIECE ! ! !,"Last few years I am struggling to find a good quality movies to watch. Every time I spent 1 hour just to find something. And sometimes even then movie is not so good xD. I am sure a lot of you who read this will understand what I am talking about.

Now about this movie. This is one of the best movies I have ever watched and I am not joking. I was focused every second of movie! In the same time this movie is: 1. The craziest movie ever made 2. Movie with perfect dialogues 3. Movie with strong life message 4. Extremely funny movie 5. Movie with total chaos in it 6. Movie with a lot of psychological knowledge

I was blown away after this movie. I was like what the hell did I just watched. And after few minutes I realized I watched a TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!!!!

My personal opinion is that this movie will be one huge favorite for winning the Oscar !",10
24 April 2022,Stupid and intelligent at the same time,"Stupid funny and yet super intelligent script, supported by good acting. Must watch for a sci-fi multiverse lovers.a fun filled sci-fi adventure movie.

8 May 2022,Really good but thought the metaphor / theme was a little weak,"Incredible, absurdist, comedic entertainment. But linking the multiverse element back to the main story (family drama) was a little weak and stops this movie from being truly amazing.

15 March 2023,A masterpiece!!,"The film deals with all major aspects of life in such an artistically valuable way that you have to give the entire team and the actors absolute respect. In a small setting, human traits are portrayed in such detail and subtlety that it is a delight. It's all about love and family. We can all find ourselves in this masterpiece and reflect on ourselves. After many rather dreary years, it is again an outstanding film experience for me, which is coherent and yet stirring, which makes me think about myself and the world and on which I can grow as a small star in the universe/multiverse. To all the critics here I wish enlightenment and as much love as they can take!

21 June 2022,It's delicious,"If anyone could make a movie that I'd watch at home and not even think to take my phone or get bored, these guys did it.

The picture, the cast, the story It's flawless.

19 March 2023,The emperor has a clothes,"I've tried to watch this movie for 4 times but still cannot finish it. Before it gains its Oscars fame, I tried it 2 times as a Chinese. It lacked interesting elements to keep me watching. After it swept Oscars, I thought this movie must has something attractive I missed in my two attempts. So I quiet my mind, put it on. It sent me to sleep for another two times. Now I have my conclusion: the emperor has nothing on. Those who gave Oscars to this movie must out of their mind. But wait, they always did this way. For many years, the best Picture award has been given to this kind of clueless pretentious movie. For those who REALLY think this is a good movie, I admire your brain structure.

4 April 2023,Short.,"Its Inception combined with the Matrix for stoned people. Visualy amazing, costumes great, camera good. I am still figuring out why this movie won so many oscars. There was a lot of better movies this year for sure. I had a clarity moment once during this movie which enlightened me a bit, so its worth the watch... Still wondering how someone cam up with all those absurd, crazy ideas, its just like an abstract experimental art, when you have no idea where this is all going... Nice choreography btw, there is a lot of fighting scenes...its chaos from start till end and still makes sense and makes my eyes wet.

27 December 2022,For people who like to think -- Ignore the bad reviews from people who want movies to be easy,"In many places, the film confuses -- but only if you aren't paying attention. I'll grant that the one impediment for me was the broken English; it was hard to follow at times and I missed things.

But the script was innovative and, yes, derivative (as some have complained), but derivative in that it points out its references, such as The Matrix, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rick and Morty, amongst others. It's a lot of fun if you stick with it.

A few things could be improved/changed, such as the butt plug scene, which made no sense; and some editing was needed for the bagel scenario, which went on too long. The ""message"" was a bit heavy-handed, and should have been handled in a manner more befitting the zaniness of the film.

I'm going to watch it again, to see what I missed, this time with closed captions.

Not perfect, but definitely one of the better films of the year. If you like being spoon-fed sentimentality and simple plots, like that found in The Shawshank Redemption, this is not your movie.",8
9 April 2022,Complex and profound without taking itself too seriously.,"A farce roller coaster ride with countless awkward unexpected turns around each infinite corner.

Original as it is deliberately random, this deeply philosophical journey feels a bit like The Matrix got an ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" makeover.

The Meticulously planned storytelling is done with both precision, and sporadic slapstick humor.

But above all...This movie may be one of the most brutally honest stories about love and family that exists in modern film.

17 May 2022,Just go see it please,"One of the most original, funny, oddball, heartwarming films I can recall ever seeing. Scenes that stay with you long after the credits, the second ones that is. Visually stunning, comedic yet profound, intelligent yet utterly silly. Somehow all the contradictions work to form a wonderful film which I will be seeing again and again. Bravo to all involved in making the film. Beats the living hell out of that other multiverse film with much gusto and rubber dil.....err never mind.

20 February 2023,Whole Lotta Cringe,"The funniest pattern in these reviews is the number of ravers condescending to everyone who disliked this mess, 'You obviously didn't get it.'

Uh-huh. That's it. Went straight over our heads...

Three out of four of the main actors were excellent (sorry, Stephanie Hsu). Portions of the film were quite moving; I cried more than a bit.

But, god, my kingdom for rewrites and some ruthless editing! The film was so repetitive and overlong I wondered how the directors and producers could possibly believe the story played as is. Much of the visual humor was overused to an embarrassing degree. The IRS audit evoked more suspense and tension than the super villain/end-of-the-world plot, which was entirely unconvincing.

The film's ultimate Message, the love and kindness offered as an antidote to...well, everything, would have carried more weight if it weren't undermined by the protagonist almost immediately.

How 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' got so overhyped is a mystery, beyond the obvious appeal of a feel-good Hollywood underdog(s) tale. Love me some underdogs! And weird is *always* more interesting than tentpole flicks. But when people first touted EEAAO as a potential Best Picture nominee, I thought they were joking. Now it's the odds-on favorite? Are films where you could sleep through 45 minutes and not miss anything essential really something to aspire to?",4
30 July 2023,A beautifully brilliant existential crisis,"If you have never had an existential crisis that comes with or immediately precedes a Great Depression where nothing makes sense, everything hurts, you're confused and fighting the unrelenting urge to throw yourself into the void, sorry bagel, of doom, then you are unlikely to understand any of this.

It has been a very long time since a movie has forced me to focus all of my attention on it, by barraging my senses, making me read AND watch AND pay attention, I was not half on my phone, wondering where I'd seen the actors before, making mental lists of what I needed to do after it ended. I was fully immersed in the experience, even when I didn't understand what was going on, I was invested, I wanted to understand.

What I got was a story about family and love and that ability it has to pull you back from the edge even when it all feels too much, when you feel everything, everywhere, all at once and question why we are even here and what the point of it all is. We often don't need answers, we need the person who stands beside us, holds our hand, says 'I'm confused too but I love you and I'm here'. I think this was a truly wacky, beautiful story and I loved it.",9
22 May 2022,beautiful!!!,"I love everything about this movie, the acting, the art, music, THE PLOT!!, this is a masterpiece and a spectacular work of art. Best movie i have ever seen. So emotional and perfect storytelling that makes you want go out and LIVE!!! And love and experience and embrace life.

16 March 2023,Unexpectedly brilliant!,"I avoided to watch it as I am not a fan of absurdistic parodies... until Curtis got the Oscar, which made me curious . Armed with new patience I turned it on, it is on Prime TV.

I didn't expect to last the full 140 minutes and the first 20 something were... challenging as I couldn't place it anywhere.

But slowly it opened up, and the brilliant acting only helped me to navigate through this circus of emotions, depth, superficiality, human nature, clich√©s, philosophy, comedy, costumes, caricature and even real tears (I'm human after all:). The world in a nutshell with us, humble beings as observers. Incomprehensible, incommensurable, impressive, unpredictable, entropic.

The title says it all.

Warning: you will either hate it of find it genial.",9
14 September 2023,Absurd masterpiece we never knew we needed,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",10
20 October 2022,Simply perfect,"Upon first view I instantly thought ""wow this is one of the best movies I've seen in the last 10 years.""

Upon second view i think, ""wow this is the best movie I've seen in the last 20 years""

After the third view.... I can squarely place this in my top 10 (personal favorite) films of all time.

It just has everything.....a beautifully woven story from SUCH a complex plot. I kept thinking to myself ""how the hell could a writer pitch this coherently???""

As usual....glad A24 was able to answer the call.

It's just such a beautiful family film....with superhero/super natural elements that has so much heart, humor and a great message. Entirely unique and unlike anything I can possibly compare it to. I simply can't endorse this movie enough.",10
28 April 2023,"It's simplistic, childish","Worst movie I have ever seen and believe me I have seen REALLY bad and/or overrated movies! Stupid, full of bad taste (makes Farelli brothers look like Ingmar Bergman), meaningless and tries to be cleverer than it really is. Avoid it by any means!""

Unless you've been living on Mars, you probably know by now that Everything Everywhere All At Once won all the Oscars. Hooray for them and probably well deserved too. But just in case all the film-worshipping is getting on your nerves, we went searching for some bad reviews of the film, because well, you can't make everyone happy everywhere, not all at once.

6 November 2022,Easiest 10 Stars Ever.,"For the first 1-2 acts of this movie, it's intentionally very confusing and hard to follow. But slowly, everything begins to click into place, and when it does, it couldn't pay off better. With exciting, tense scenes, ridiculous situations, and hard-hitting emotional exchanges, it has it all without feeling cheap. I'm not even afraid to over-hype this movie because I hyped it up for some of my friends, and they still loved it.

Be warned though: This movie doesn't really fit into any genre, and will be wildly different from almost all other movies out there. It's like an art movie that also has an intensely heavy-hitting story line(s?). So good, if you get a chance you have to watch it.

I have never seen a film quite like it but I thought the end dragged on too long. Although I liked the film, I was getting impatient for it to end. Sounds weird but it could've ended a good 20 mins earlier than it did.

Overall, a great film and I would recommend it.

17 October 2022,A magnificent cinematic trip.,"I've seen this movie 5 times now, and I still don't know how to sum it up. But I'll briefly try, just enough to meet the length requirement üòâ.

This movie is about despair, love, faith, nihilism, and the unrelenting human spirit... but it's also gag comedy, unflinching absurdity, and visual cotton candy. It's a lot (hence the title), but it somehow works.

And it really gets better each time you watch it - for me, the 5th watch was the best so far. I don't think I can say that about any other movie.

One last thing: you ought to watch this movie with friends or family - if not on your first watch, then the next time you watch it. Trust me. It's a conversation starter.

31 December 2022,Feels like a punch in the face-but in a good way-,"Well, the movie started out as some sort of a drama, and then drastically changes into the most creative piece of art I've seen this century.

From the moment in the ensurance-building, the entire tone of the changes, and just becomes a better version of ""Doctor Strange 2"", since its just so much more creative.

Michelle Yeoh is acting her soul out, and the rest if the cast does as well.

This has propably been the most creative movie i have watched in my life, and i dont think that is ever going to change.

However, a few friends of mine said, the movie was ""too much"", which is understandable, but cant overshadow, how fun it is, if you do enjoy it.

I just wanted to watch it because so many people recommended it, so I watched the first 15 mins a month ago but couldn't continue and a month later I said, I might be wrong, so I continued the movie but turned out I was right about how silly it is.

16 March 2023,"A Good Film About Family, Non-Political","I'm Asian. I'm politically right-wing. I saw this film over a year ago. I enjoyed it. The movie is about an immigrant woman whose hopes and dreams were repeatedly beaten and destroyed, but it is her love for her family that keeps her going. It reminded me of my immigrants parents, who worked so hard, and their dreams shattered, just to provide for the family. It's a genuinely good film. The action and the multi-universe, and the questionable but hilarious props and scenes, it's entertaining.

Some people are making this into a political thing, like as if this is a leftist agenda. It's not at all. It has nothing to do with Asian agenda, or whatever it is. This film was highly rated even a year ago. We're seeing a bunch of negative reviews from salty people.

2 January 2023,What an experience,"One of the most creative films I know. If you watch this film without any prior knowledge, it will leave you completely stunned, as it is a unique combination of the family drama und sci fi genres. I really love the feeling of seeing something I have never seen before and this is exactly the case in this film. The effects are really high-quality and despite many bizarre scenes, the movie is never ridiculous. The fight scenes alone are an absolute experience. You definitely have to watch the movie a second time. Firstly, for a better understanding. And secondly because there are so extrem many details that are worth to be discovered. In many places you can't be sure why something is happening. But that doesn't matter because what happens is so particularly interesting and entertaining.

30 January 2023,Multiversal yet Universal,"It's a low budget independent production from the wonderful A24 Films. It's also a creative powerhouse about the multiverse that can make Marvel jealous. It uses the most cheap and shallow forms of humour you can think of, while offering a symbolism extravaganza that reaches deeper every time you think about it. Hard to classify, hard to describe... but let's try.

In one sentence, it is a film with a multiverse clothing over a core of family relationships. In its essence, it's a mother/daughter, wife/husband story.

The contrast between a complex sci-fi theme and something so human, with which we deal since the beginning of times, makes it layered and easy to relate to.

It's multiversal, but it's universal.

Also, as an underlying theme, it presents a philosophical confrontation of Jobu Tupaki's (daughter) nihilism and Waymond's (father) optimism. Bagel vs. Googly Eye.

As a visual metaphor, one is the inversion of the other: a black symmetrical donut with hollow center, a white asymmetrical eye with black center. Both circles having similar geometric properties but indicating opposite approaches to life.

The literal ""Everything Bagel"" was made by Jobu Tupaki. With her godlike powers (acquired from being split across infinite universes), she compresses all that exists in a donut-shaped singularity. When you experience everything, she says, nothing matters. Life is hollow.

On the other hand, Waymond uses googly eye's stickers to attach joy and kindness to everything. For him, even dull things can be seen as worth of appreciation, happiness can dwell in enjoyable little moments. Life has substance.

Throughout the movie, the Daniels use several round shapes to address and reinforce this duality.

At first, in images as the washing machine's doors or in the way Deirdre (IRS auditor) draws a messy circle on Evelyn's (mother) papers, they refer to the bagel. Inevitability, lack of finality, monotony. Evelyn is trapped in her cyclic routine, in a tedious laundry business, dealing with the IRS. What is the point? It could easily drive her towards nihilism.

By the end, the circular shapes become more asymmetrical and colourful. The chinese decorative lights are framed more instead of the machine's doors in the laundry scenes, Deirdre's pencil (the same she used to circle Evelyn's papers) shows a colourful ball attached to its top. It's optimism taking front.

Evelyn makes a journey of getting out of her inertia and self-absorption, experiencing instead her daughter's and her husband's views about life. Thus, comprehending them truly and loving them honestly. The circle now represents connection.

Camus said: ""What gives value to travel is fear."" Perhaps we can conclude that Evelyn's journey was full of fear, full of wanting to get back to what was, but ultimately fear shook her up and she was ready to see value on Waymond's way. His kind way of fighting. She realized that keeping their customers coming and having Deirdre give them more time were Waymond's merits, that past victories were not because of her, but in spite of her.

At the moment she wears the googly eye as a third eye, she is enlightened. And then, having traveled from nihilism to existentialism, she is able to guide her daughter through the same path. Empathy.

I also love the recurrent use of irony. This is an exhilarating movie about laundry and taxes. The name of the daughter is Joy. The very fact that the worst version of Evelyn is the best fitted to save the multiverse is hilarious.

Being always just one decision away from a better version of herself, Evelyn is able to connect more easily to all her better universes. As she chose always the worst path, several better paths, and it's acquired skills, are now uniquely close to her. There is a lesson the movie wants to teach us here.

Even the most ridiculous universes are capable of carrying deeper and valuable meaning. In fact, the Daniels seem to dedicate themselves to come up with the most extravagant, nonsensical, absurd ideas, and commit to them, just to reinforce the argument that it is possible to find the best in the worst. The hotdog fingers could have been just a brief visual gag, but became a full arc, as did Raccacoonie, and contributed decisively to the final resolution.

It adds to this approach that the most violent scenes are filled with comedy and feel frivolous. And that the most laughable settings or visually empty parts carry an emotional punch. The rocks, how do not cry with them!

The film is named Everything Everywhere All at Once and hardly I've seen any movie edited and composed so fittingly to its name. It's remarkable that it can be so cohesive with such a wide range of subjects, genres, techniques.

Is it sci-fi, comedy, coming of age story, martial arts, romance, thriller, drama, musical? Everything at once. The mix of genres make it impossible to classify.

Is it spoken in english, mandarin, cantonese? Everything at once. Grandpa speaks cantonese, daughter english, husband mandarin, and Evelyn has to mix it up. At first, the cultural and language differences within the family act as barriers to deeper relationships. At the end, the mutual acceptance, empathy and the realisation of their connecting lines bring the family together, and they are richer because of their diversity.

Is it 1.33:1, 1.85:1, 2:1, 2.33:1? All aspect ratios at once. It changes constantly. 1.33 (4:3), reminiscent of old TV screen proportions, used in flashbacks. 1.85, an aspect that can fill the entire movie screen without pillar boxes, used on dialogues, romantic moments and other situations were realism is needed. 2.33, the widest of them all, in cinematic fight scenes or large scope shots. 2:1, an odd and uncommon aspect ratio, in the sausage fingers' universe.

Each universe is also shot and colour-graded in different ways. Anamorphic vs Spherical lenses, flatter/colourful/greener gradings... these all are used and yet the final result is cohesive. To achieve that the editing here is nothing short of spectacular. Wow, those transitions!

There are also a plethora of references, homages. The most obvious ones: Kubrick's 2001, Tarantino's Kill Bill, Pixar's Ratatouille, Wong Kar-Wai's In The Mood for Love. Also, Matrix, Hong Kong kung fu movies, and several others influences can be spotted. A multiverse of movies within this one.

The soundtrack is a masterpiece. We also have everything at once here. Classical music, pop songs, ethnic, circus and western themes... dozens of small motives, arranged differently according to the context. Each one helping us identify a universe, a character relationship. For instance, Clair de Lune appears for the first time in a fight scene between Evelyn and Deirdre. When Evelyn can finally say ""I Love You"" in a truthful manner, it plays. Afterwards, we find out that there is a universe where both are lovers, and Clair de Lune is the soundtrack of this relationship.

Another example: Waymond says: ""Your clothes never wear as well the next day, your hair never falls quite the same way"", describing the multiverse. This is from the 2000's song ""Story of a Girl"" by the one-hit wonder band Nine Days. When he says it, many of us possibly sensed something familiar about those words, but not quite sure what. A very parallel universe/deja vu kind of feeling. Afterwards, the song plays in the movie, including different versions of the lyrics and arrangements, made by the original band, according to each universe.

Add to all that the superb acting from all 4 main actors. They are mesmerizing. Michelle Yeoh delivers a wide range of several versions of herself. And among all that, she conveys the stages of fatalism, self denial, enlightenment and acceptance Evelyn has to pass through.

Ke Huy Quan transforms from kind and naive to confident and experienced with just a flick of his expressions and body language. We are never confused about what version of Waymond is on screen.

Stephanie Hsu is as big as Jobu Tupaki is, and not every actor can pull it off. The hopelessness, the solitude, the sense of inadequacy, all there in her eyes and with a crazy costume design that she tames as a horse whisperer.

Jamie Lee Curtis was never freer, exposing a vulnerability I'd not yet seen in her past roles. Laying all on the table: being a stern and judgemental auditor, a delicate and compassionate partner, a monstrous and menacing villain. A bravura acting.

At the end of the 3 acts, all this ridiculous amount of everything imaginable surprisingly showcase a cohesive work. How could the Daniels put everything in this bagel and come up with something as tight as this marvels me. It is another testament to the recurring theme: connection. Emotional, visual, thematic.

All connects as in a circle.",10
20 March 2023,Dreadful,"Have you heard of The Emperor's New Clothes where everyone everywhere is saying oh what a wonderful film/movie this is for fear of looking ridiculous, when actually it's just a really bad film/movie? This. After a promising start I switched off at around the 8th point of craziness. Then someone who is very complimentary of The Emperor's New Clothes said I should really stick with it as it's amazing. So, I gave it another go and watched a further 40 minutes. At around the 27th or 28th point of craziness and after a total viewing time of around 90 minutes I said enough is enough and pressed stop. Forget it..

It is easy to watch and it does an incredible job during the comedy parts It also told a great story about.a normal women growing up., learning about herself, finding what is most important for herself, reconciliation with her family and herself and take the next step for her life.

22 May 2022,Less could've been more,"Great film but the only critique I have - and this is only my opinion - is that the movie tried too hard to be weirder and quirkier than it already is just for the sake of it. Too much razzle dazzle at times that it gets too repetitive and predictable. Could've done less, but would still leave the same impact, if not, even better.

I didnt wanna pause it. This is my favourite movie of all time. Even though only 1/5 of this decade has passed, i can guarantee you this movie will make the top 10 best of this decade. A 9.4/10.

22 March 2023,Incredible genious and creative writting,"Just...perfect on its imperfection. Watch it with an open mind. We are really tiny in the universe.

The creativity and acting are the cherry on top!

At first I was thinking ""this scene doesn't make sense"" but then you really piece everything together like a puzzle.

All the cast was well choosen for the parts. And the movie deserves the recognition it received.

For me ""Everything, Everywhere All At Once resumes the first three months of 2023: caos and questions.

Well watch it and then review it, it helps to read different points of view. I gave it 10 stars. The rating now is 7.9, I am curious to see the rating at the end of 2023.",10
17 July 2022,Everything we needed all at once,"I think this is the most accessible bonkers film I've ever seen. There is such a profound and irreverent art that anyone, even if you're not a film person, can grok at an existential level. The themes throughout drip with sincerity while staying utterly enjoyable. I am so glad someone paid for this masterwork to be made.

5 February 2023,Tour-de-force in every department.,"This is what happens when you get extremely creative directors and writers together with super talented actors, and give them a project that allows all of them to make career-defining work. Every single aspect of this film is as close to perfect as I've seen. The images on screen are lush and saturated with color and texture, the camera work is kinetic and puts you right in the middle of all the action, the ensemble cast is fantastic (more below), the stunts are mind-blowing (and hilarious), the story is totally weird and original (and a bit mind-bending, but don't worry it all makes sense in the end), the special effects make you scratch your head and wonder: ""how did they do that???""

A quick moment of focus on the acting in ""Everything Everywhere..."". The role of Evelyn is very difficult as it carries the weight of the entire film, which is told almost entirely from her perspective. She has to go from a tired, end-of-her rope, slightly downtrodden immigrant woman whose hopes have been dashed by harsh reality, to the saviour of not only our universe, but countless others as well, realizing along the way that the little daily events and love of her family, is what will save her. Michelle Yeoh pulls this off masterfully, letting us see in her face (and whole being) the transitions she's undergoing, at great peril to her own sanity. But she in no way does this feat on her own. The talent arrayed around her is so powerful: an almost unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis portrays her nemesis IRS agent; Ke Hui Kwan (known from Indiana Jones and The Goonies) in his first major film role in over 20 years portrays Evelyn's husband Waymond, at once both the ass-kicking protagonist and tender beating heart of the family; the radiant Stephanie Hsu plays Joy, Evelyn's daughter and unexpected antagonist. Even the minor parts (James Hong, Tallie Medel,and. Jenny Slate) are fleshed-out and contribute greatly to the film.

The result, is a film that feels holistic, that presses all the buttons. It's by turns hilarious, balls-to-the-wall exciting, devastatingly sad, and ultimately life-affirming and uplifting. One of the best films I've seen in the last 10 years.",10
23 May 2022,Why the love for such a bad movie?,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",3
25 May 2022,Just watch it!,"I adore Michelle and this shows many facets of her talent. Just watch & try not to over think it. It's brilliant & the entire cast needs to be recognized for the great job they've done.

20 March 2023,A great movie that gets better the second time you watch it,"I'm blown away. This sci-fi movie is a masterpiece that takes you on a mind-bending journey through multiple dimensions and timelines. I was captivated by the film's exploration of immigration issues and cultural identity, as well as the emotional storyline between mom and daughter. The exceptional performances of the cast and stunning visuals made this movie an unforgettable experience.

So if you've already seen ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" I highly recommend giving it another watch. You'll be surprised at how much more you can discover and enjoy. And if you haven't seen it yet, get ready for a wild ride that's sure to leave you wanting more.""

10 March 2023,"It's an experience, a very good one mind you!","I see a lot of people saying they didn't like the plot, the acting or the physical elements of this film. You have to look deeper than surface level elements to see the true beauty of this film in my opinion. Just open your mind and absorb it and feel truly.

I believe the meaning and messaging of this film is deeper than the parts which form it and what makes it rather amazing.

You have to stop thinking and really experience this.

Though I understand if you usually watch Marval characters fight stuff where there's a clear story with a definitive (predictable) ending, this film is probably lost on you.

25 April 2023,Lucy done right. Just love everything about it.,"This movie is extraordinary.

It takes every movie troppe it manages to throw in to tell the story of an ordinary family and their relationship through the unforgiving chaos of life.

This movie masterfully pieces together everything from dark commedy to magical realism to BDSM in the most adorable way possible.

I feel that only people who actually understand how family dynamics impacts EVERYTHING in us can fully understand the hugeness of this work of art.

I myself made peace with my deceased parents and our conplicated relationship because this movie showed me a different perspective. Thanks.

12 March 2023,Phenomenal Work & I couldn't guess what could happen next.,"Brilliant story, phenomenal characters and victorious acting performances! Very entertaining film, this went beyond and orchestrated a range of genuine emotions.

Every scene kept my attention and generated a range of emotions from initially anxious, humorous, curious, confused, excited, scared, sad, & overwhelming heart ache.

Visually appealing with amazing action, inspirational messages, and easter eggs foreshadowing here and there that I noticed after watching the 2nd time.

Beautiful work by all involved! We want more films like this... it definitely kept me on my toes..I couldn't guess what could happen next. Thats rare. Very well done.

8 April 2023,"Creative, funny, relatable","I went to Everyman cinema to watch this movie and let me get this straight, I slept for about 20 minutes at some point because it was feeling endless and boring as they were building up the story but after waking up, THE MOVIE WAS BOMB. Made me laugh (a lot) made me cry too. Motherhood is explored and you can see how experiences create different emotions on the mother's side and on the daughter's side. I really appreciated that relationship explored. The relationship with the husband too made me put a lot into perspective: we always want things to be different, we want the people we love to act a certain type of way towards us and sometimes even blame them for the who we are and who we are not. But at the end of the day we need to make the best of every situation, appreciate where we are. She had several lives lived in different spaces where she felt more accomplished but the actual her in her universe was the best and the most fulfilled at the end of the day. The scene with the rocks, one of my favorite too.

Great movie, a lot of cognitive capacities where awake due the multiple colors, scenes, jokes. The Oscar was very well deserved. Good actors, good script, good story build up.",8

17 March 2023,A modern classic. Best movie to release in years,"In a time where most popular movies are marvel movies or remakes of old films, EEAAO is a truly unique, creative, emotional and brilliant film. It is a mind opening, sometimes uncomfortable, challenging, deeply emotional journey that you need to embrace to fully enjoy.

First off I want to say that there are a ton of negative and 1 star reviews coming in, and if you read them or look at the demographics they are mostly from people who admit they did not watch the entire thing or did not get it, and are often older folks giving bad reviews. Not that you need to be younger to enjoy, it just uses a lot of things that are easier for people under 50-60 to understand.

This movie is truly incredible and touching. The performances are incredible, especially from the leads. It will make you laugh, cry, and wow at how crazy the action and editing is.

The only valid criticisms in my mind, is that it is a long watch that can be laboring on the first watch bc you are trying to keep up with everything and figure the story out completely. There were maybe a few fighting scenes and extras they could have cut out. I really liked it the first time i watched. It became one of my all time favorites the second. Blows my mind that some did not connect to the story. Me and many others cry like a baby at the ending.

If you are in the mood to commit time and emotion to a great film, and you have an open mind about how they get you there, then this movie is for you and you will love it as much as myself and many others have!",10
26 July 2023,Simply touching movie,"Kindness can change world.

One action by action of our generousity, we all start from there.

I was extremely shocked when I first watched this movie. Even though life might be tough, you want to give up everything and just lay down, this movie gives me lesson to stand up again.

We are so small existence in absolutely gigantic cosmos. This movie taught me we should love and encourage each other.

Michelle Yeoh, who is the main character of this movie, was completely amazing that I was totally absorbed in the film every second.

The CGI was absolutely amazing and so was the soundtrack.

I highly recommend this movie when you feel you are in a rut in your life. We can feel how surprisingly valuable every moment is.",9

22 March 2023,Not My cup of Tea,"I try my best to see all best picture nominations before the Oscars. This was one of three that kept me from my goal but I was determined to see it especially after it won. I sincerely feel the academy missed their mark this year. What a mishmash of headache causing chaos. Not at all enjoyable in my opinion. Just glad I did not pay to see it on the big screen. I feel like I got the message, I just didn't enjoy the ride. Not sure that I agree with the supporting or best actor/actress awards from the movie either. Maybe the academy is striving to be inclusive but missing the mark in the process.

1 April 2023,Ignore bad review,"Bad reviews are from people who are scared of something new. Honestly movie is awesome and intense. Highly recommend. At least you won't know util you watch. Powerful message, and got you thinking. Acting, transitioning, special effects and music are on the other level. At least this movie is very much different from basic movies we've seen every day. On the other hand, there is a funny side of the story, so you have comic relief parts, which makes movie more interesting and effective. To sum up, very much worth to watch, you will not regret it. One hundred and fifty minutes of pure joy. 10/10.

31 December 2022,Best movie I've seen in a long time...,"A fantastic film that was brilliantly written and thankfully the direction was executed perfectly to do the story justice.

While it won't be to everyone's taste, for those who can appreciate (and see) the nuance beyond the ridiculous (and hilarious) elements, it is an incredible end product. The way it ties universal themes and emotions together through a complex yet understandable storyline warrants a lot of praise.

The acting is, for the most part, right on point. The ability to switch between characters so seemlessly can be hard to master but how it was done here was as good as it gets.

Ultimately, this is a film you will either love or hate, there can be no in-between.

First of all, it's mesmerizing how the movie sets the mood from the beginning and maintains for the very end. Simultaneously, while the plot about the different universes and characters of the protagonist could be very confusing to the audience, it ends up being very easy to follow. Finally, the photography and the editing aspect of the movie is simply breathtaking!! The only negative thing is that you can't experience it the same way as the first time...

12 December 2022,Nothing Nowhere All Too Long,"I'm glad Short Round can still find work, and maybe Indiana Jones could have added some sense to this, but a bad take off of Buckaroo Banzai that runs 2&1/2 hours isn't great cinema. It was like a low budget Jackie Chan remake of '2001 a Space Odyssee' and they never leave the planet, do more emotional quarreling than kung fu fighting, leaving the ending needing a space baby to hug and instead you get a bagel, with no cream cheese. After reading all of the rave reviews about this movie and finally watching it I started to believe in alternative universes and suspect I must be living in one because 'Big Trouble in Little China' deserved an Academy Award before this turkey.

13 April 2023,Mostly Bonkers,"While it can be a bit slow to get started and a bit slow in places, many parts are downright bonkers and quite funny. It's worth giving it a bit of a chance. If you got to the first bit of proper action and didn't warm to it, then probably not worth persevering.

That said it could easily have had a bit of trimming and towards the end I did feel like I'd been duped a little, as this seems to end as a wholesome ""family"" story.

While the core story uses the same couple of locations many of the extra cut scenes made it less samey.

Acting was top notch, with everyone as you'd expect and more.

Give it a chance.

16 March 2023,Great modern movie; times are changing,"The fact that this movie sweeped the oscars is a good sign in my eyes.

Over are the days when only hyper-story focused movies got a chance. Make way for more chaotic storylines, more chaotic concepts, more chaotic everything.

Pros:
Great acting by pretty much everyone on cast
Fantastic concept art
Fantastic levels of creativity
Great gags...


Cons:






I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It didn't try to cater to the blockbuster crowd, didn't try to cater to the arthouse crowd and somehow managed to impress both.

If you don't like concept driven movies, I would strongly suggest skipping this one. If you're open to experience something different WATCH THIS.

And if you liked this, go watch something even MORE different and put in Tarkovsky's Mirrors.",8
21 May 2022,Uniquely Brillient Sci Fi,"It's weird, it's quirky, yet it is one of the most uniquely interesting sci fi movie ever made. Hats off to Michelle Yeoh's performance, her delivery of diverse acting is a masterpiece. Story was very integrating; directing, camera work, action sequences, set and costume designs are all top notch. It was a real visual treat.

My one criticism is later part of the film felt a bit slow for me.

This movie thought me that love is the most important thing to have in life and that nothing else matter except surrounding yourself with the people you love. It's as such a complex film with such a simple and core meaning.

The colours In the film are so vibrant and dull at the same time. This movie is (imo) the perfect depiction of what a person should get out of watching a movie. Feelings of both happiness, sadness, confusion, but at the end walking out having learnt something that can benefit your life as well as feeling like you have wasted 3 hours of your life.

Absolutely in love with the movie and is one of those film you always think back in and say ""what I would do to watch that again""!

For me, and from many reviews I have read and seen this is a very polarizing movie. I will go on a whim and say some people will perceive this as pretentious nonsense, naive, utterly absurd and therefore write it off. Although that is why the movie is utterly brilliant.

What the directors, referred to as 'Daniels', have managed here is a beautiful commentary on the philosophy of life, the importance of those around us and a masterful telling of relationships between generations. It is a rollercoaster of emotions, I found myself laughing hysterically and sobbing uncontrollably whilst watching throughout.

The first part, ""Everything"" lays the foundation work for the movie, sets up the concepts and launches the viewer headfirst into the narrative. It sets it up like an a-typical villain movie, you side with one team and it almost seems like your a-typical action film with great comic relief and fantastic fight sequences. The movie however truly begins with part 2, ""Everywhere"".

The second part is where this movie masterfully paints it's narrative. Interlinking ideas of relationships, love, kindness, empathy, masculinity and trauma on the basis of what was set up by part 1 in ""Everything"". Whilst in a typical movie the characters tend to go through their own 'arcs' this movie puts the audience through one. It questions at the meaning of life and provides it's own answer. Whether or not you agree with it is up to you, although I found myself suitably moved at the message this film delivered.

Part 3, ""All at Once"" serves as a beautiful, emotional conclusion.

The acting performances were also masterful. In a movie as utterly absurd as this it takes something really special to make it feel so grounded. Kudus to Ke Huy Quan, he is one of the main reasons this movie works so well.

I cannot recommend this movie enough, I wish more people ""got it"" and took the humanitarian messages it offers. Hollywood needs more films like Everything Everywhere All at Once. I will never forget how this film made me feel.",10
27 May 2023,Oscars Awards are apsurd!,"I've watched hundreds and hundreds of movies in my life, and rarely did I have to stop the movie halfway through because it's stupid for some reason... this movie is stupid for many reasons, and I was happy to stop it and save an hour of my life. The American Film Academy has shown for the umpteenth time that the Oscar awards have become absurd... films like these do not deserve to be nominated at all, let alone be declared the best. I'm glad that every now and then a movie like ""Parasite"" or ""Coda"" wins an Oscar, they deserve awards because of the incredible story, acting and impact they leave on the viewer... unlike this movie. Everything, everywhere all at Once is a pale attempt at a combination of superhero movies, sci-fi, and comedy, and unfortunately, it fails in any of them.

8 December 2022,An acid trip-like cinematic experience,"I admit that I had to do a second viewing to understand the film better and I'm glad I did. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a true masterpiece. It's not common to see a film that incorporates elements from a number of genres and film mediums and executes it flawlessly. But even with its twisted and true swirl of genre anarchy, the film is simply a drama about a family trying to work their issues out.

Like many other people say, Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the most original films ever made. The writing and the execution were near perfect. Michelle Yeoh's performance was superb and Ke Huy Quan was just fun. The visuals, the cinematography, the editing, and the music were outstanding. It's a hard watch and definitely not for everyone, but for those who enjoyed this acid trip-like cinematic experience, we could agree that this is one of this year's best.

5 July 2022,"So different, love it!","It's genius, amazing way to portray such a complicated topic: the multiverse. Even though there's a lot going on (as the title suggests) the movie manages to keep a clear storyline, which is original, entertaining, and meaningful. Its humor is so different yet so on point with the tone of the movie. And the visuals, gosh I enjoyed them so much.

22 April 2022,Most entertaining movie since Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"This was so good! Funny, original, and an overall amazingly entertaining movie. I thought it was slightly too long, the ending was off. Wild movie overall, I think about it all the time and I watched it 2 weeks ago. Must watch in theatres. The special FX, sound, and overall performance from the cast is 10/10. I would rate the pace/length of it at some portions of the plot a 7/10, but overall one of the best I have seen. Made me think of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse because I was shocked at how good it was. No hype, pure entertainment.

25 May 2022,A modern day classic!,"Visually stunning, surprisingly small in scale, with both inventive and silly jokes, jaw-dropping action scenes, dramatic twists...

That alone would qualify it for an enjoyable time, but no...this movie doesn't stop there. It goes all in with its underlying message and holds nothing back. Themes, plots and meanings that will be spoken of for years to come.

All held up thanks to an amazing cast. Every single one doing their absolute best: Michelle Yeoh has to do much lifting, succeeds at everything she does and perhaps delivered the best performance of her career.

But man, do I have to point out Ke Huy Quan, who almost has to do just as much as Yeoh and he chose one hell of a role to come back to acting. I can only hope it will encourage him to stick around.",10
5 December 2022,"""This multiverse is more madness than doctor Strange multiverse of madness""","I'm impressed with the multiverse concept that more complicated than doctor Strange MoM, but I still can understand the movie because the movie explain how that's happen with a lot of comedy that made me laugh, and this movie is so emotional sometimes it's made me laugh, sometimes it's made me tense and sometimes it's made me cry little bit, butttt the ending is the perfect one because it done all things that happen in the movie and all the problem is solve in the ending and the ending is mean a lot for a family who need it, but this movie is not for all age because this movie had a adult jokes and comedy, but that's fine.

I love this movie soooo muchhhhh.

31 May 2023,Stick with it... Mom,"Everything everywhere all at once is a story about being a mother, letting go, fear, and love. With a whole bunch of real and not so real nightmares thrown into the mix. Oh, and king fu. Lots. Of. Kung Fu!

It's an existential dip into the nature of reality. Of life. Of living. Of being alive. Of being human through multiple universes of possibility and potential.

It doesn't make any sense: until it does.

Stick with it.

Right until just before the end... (no spoiler alert).

Because if you follow it - and you can 'get it'... It'll pop you out the other side into a wonderful dimension, where being a Mom actually makes sense.

And it rocks.",10
6 July 2022,Not as advertised!,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

11 December 2022,Yo-Yo-Yeoh!,"Admittedly, I tuned in because of the talented headliners, Michelle Yeoh and J. L Curtis............I was not let down; what a brilliant, beautiful film (seriously funny too).

This movie blends, and bends, time effortlessly. The chaotic streaking of time with each universes' character is a delight to witness.

The humour in this film is unexpected at times making the jokes/situations all the more funny.

All of the cast was brilliant...... it was cool to see ""Data"" back in action, and James Hong too - so good! Stephanie Hsu nailed her character(s) and the coutume and make-up department deserve serious accolades.

This is probably the best movie I've seen in 2022 - I loved it! 10/10.",10
20 December 2022,Ego Death,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is one of the best movies/experiences I've ever encountered. It's sad that there are so many people not ""relating"" to or letting go and giving themselves into the story and relating to this masterpiece. It made me think and feel deeper than I can ever recall from a film.

There are some moments that I can see some people would roll their eyes at, but I cherish the playful scenes that add to the complexity and break the ice with an assumed lol or wtf moment to some... Overall, I laughed and cried (more than once!). This one challenged my mind and opened up so many memories I thought I'd lost!

I've actually experienced this... Or at least saw it in meditation and understand the idea of multi verses and infinite timelines and alternative realities. I read some of the bad reviews and I'm guessing they also don't understand the matrix or their third eye isn't open. I think the movie was brilliant and different. And makes you think of the possibilities of infinite timelines and collapsing timelines to your desired reality.

25 April 2022,Weird in the best way,"Dont go into it with details, the less you know the more entertaining it is , but that being said heres my review. The movie is straight up weird, it takes so many random turns thats compile upon each other and the genius is the plot that unravels in way that pulls them all together into cohesion. Theres so many details to the movie that they didnt breeze past and i think thats what makes it one of a kind. The raccoon ratatouille, the outfit changes the outrageous fights, etc. They took a general plot concept and gave it authenticity and Alice in wonderland details. They did what so many low budgets films try to do and thats pull off weird in a way that isnt cringey and unrealistic. This movie was alot funnier then I thought it would be , I absolutely loved the rock scenes. There's something so refreshing about seeing something completely new AND good, and this was it. Its got great shots of aesthetic fights, funny unexpected laughs, clues and puzzles and attention to detail like no other, definitely worth watching once !

19 March 2023,Oscar must have eaten the bagel,"If you want an intelligent film about the 'what ifs' of life, watch Krzysztof Kieslowski's excellent 'Przypadek' or Tom Tykwer's 'Lola Rennt', but whatever you do stay well clear of this nonsense. At 140 minutes it is at least an hour overlong and suffers from the worst crime in cinema of being boring. Puerile humour, action pieces straight out of the Marvel playbook and inane dialogue all contributed to making this a very poor effort.

Many reviewers have stated that the central premise is original, which just shows how little science fiction writing they are familiar with. Even 'Family Guy' did a much funnier job with Stewie and Brian's interdimensional antics.

How this mess was worthy of 7 Oscars is beyond me. I'm off to watch 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'The Godfather' and 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' to remind myself that there was a time the Academy recognised craft and talent.

One last thing, this film needs a warning for people with photosensitivity, which was not on Amazon. There are several almost subliminal sequences which could easily trigger a seizure.",2
2 June 2023,Infinitely brilliant and infinitely flawed,"This is the closest film I have seen that explains reality, infinity and all that.

As the narrator in Fight Club says, You met me at a very strange time in my life... I want to go and visit the sausage finger universe... I might head over there now once I've written this on my iPhone, or I'll get ketchup all over the screen!

It's missing the concept of black swans, and unknown unknowns - but that is impossible to describe. It's impossible to describe an unknown unknown - because as soon as it is known, it changes state, it exists, like Schroeders cat, or light that is both a particle or a wave, and changes once observed.

If you watch this thinking it's a wierd multiverse movie, like The Matrix or Fight Club, with characters with mental health issues that need therapy, oh dear... you've missed it...

Love it, I need to watch again and again... I wonder what movies are showing over on the rock universe?",9
10 February 2023,Great Film... To watch,"This was really a joy to watch. I have to say I did non expect something like this at all: Crazy and emotional at the same time. I've watched the film after seeing all the attention and nominations that it received at this year's Oscars and my expectations weren't the highest. I was completely wrong. The movie is kind of intricate (in a way like tenet and inception) but it has also a great emotional story and somewhat of crazy. All the actors and actresses are AMAZING and of course Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie HSU are superbe. Also if I don't know if everyone would love this film for sure, i would definitely suggest it.

2 April 2023,So surprising,"My friends and I had no preconceived notions about this film and its cast. I still can't believe it! I recommend this exceptional film, from the great and amazing actresses. A film that we will not forget!

A real UFO in the movies industry ! A very creative visual slap much more subtle than it seems to the closed brains that did not appreciate.

A certain level of culture and humor is required to understand the points.

In all this madness, there is however a great lesson of life in each of the characters, of a great delicacy.

Of an audacious mix of genres (social chronicle, science fiction and action), a strong cast (Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Lee Curtis) and original ideas.",9

22 March 2023,"Beautiful, beautiful movie.","I don't understand the negative reviews, maybe they're just not thinking deeply enough about this movie, or maybe they can't relate with the family's story. I personally found it SO relatable and accurate of most middle-aged couples with teen/young adult children. I ugly cried through the whole thing, while at the same time laughing through the whole thing. To me, I felt that the multiverse plot was just an avenue to tell us a story of acceptance. Don't get me wrong, it was such an imaginative use of multiverse theories and it was done in such a cool way. But regardless of the multiverse I think this is so worth watching. Most of us, like myself, often feel unaccomplished in life and this movie really gives those people the spotlight. You don't have to lead an extraordinary life to lead a happy life. I think that is the most important lesson this movie teaches us.

21 March 2023,Imagery for a decade,"When you think back to images that define an era, this film provides an endless stream of them. Each filled with something unique, hysterical, sad, identifiable, strange, bonkers, creative, and beautiful.

Finally! Something I haven't seen before!

A film about generational acceptance layered within a story about a family in need of some deep emotional catharsis, while dealing with a tax audit, involving a multiversal war.

You could explain every detail to someone and they'd never quite be able to visualize this mashup of every genre.

Deservedly winning its 7 Oscars, its easy to agree that it's the best picture of 2022.",10
11 March 2023,I can't believe it had so many awards and nomination,"The cinematic interpretation of multiple universe concept appears to be quite challenging. I thought Dr. Strange and his confusing multiverse experience was pretty bad until I saw how it could go worse with this flick. My expectations and standards are low when I watch movies on the plane but I could not stand more than 30 min of this nonsense. I am giving it two stars because of Michelle Yeoh. She is an awesome talent indeed. Everything else was horrible, not entertaining at all, and very difficult to watch. I do not understand the positive critic reviews and the hype. I would rather strongly discourage everyone from wasting their time on this ridiculousness. Oh, and please do not give it Oscar for best picture! It would be an utter insult for all the great filmmakers out there.

20 May 2022,"A mixed bag, but excellently made","I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of this film but felt that the second half dragged a bit. As a cinematic experience this film is stunningly well made. It's funny, heartwarming, has some great action scenes and is very, very weird.

The performances from all the main actors are brilliant and for the first half at least I felt like I was was watching something very special. Possibly my favourite film of the year so far.

However, the second half is where I started to lose a bit of interest. I don't mind a film being a bit odd as that is what makes films original - especially in this world where Hollywood churns out lifeless crap like Uncharted and The Contractor (just happen to be the last two turkey's I've watched) but I felt like the story started to drag towards the end. I started to lose track. Again, I don't mind being confused by films because this just means it's worthy of repeat viewings to pick little bits up you missed the first time - but when it is SO confusing you barely have a clue what's going on, it becomes disengaging and hampers your enjoyment. It could have done with being about 20-30 mins shorter to be honest. After such a brilliant assault on the senses over the first hour, making this over 2 hours just felt a tad too long.

Overall this was original, well acted and entertaining so it's worthy of the high praise it's getting, but I can see why it has such diverse scores. It won't be for everyone due to the madness of the last 50 mins.",8
30 July 2022,What a movie!!,"Its been a while since I've watched a film that has had such a profound impact. There are times when you question every little decision you've ever made, and wondered what would've happened if.... and this film addresses this head on. The complexities of life lye in the everyday choices we make and the impact they may have on our lives, and those closest to us. A simple concept, yet the reprocussions of these decisions can be life altering as portrayed so beautifully in this film.

What if????

15 February 2023,great cast in a plot that is sometimes complex to follow,"The movie's exploration of the multiverse is both visually stunning and thought-provoking, weaving together complex scientific concepts with inventive storytelling techniques that keep the audience engaged from beginning to end. The film's special effects are particularly impressive, adding an extra layer of immersion to the already captivating story.

The performances are generally strong, with Michelle Yeoh delivering an outstanding performance as Mei. Her character brings a relatable and emotional core to the film, balancing out the more abstract and philosophical aspects of the story. The rest of the cast, including Stephanie Hsu and Jamie Lee Curtis, also do an excellent job of bringing their characters to life, adding depth and nuance to the overall narrative.

24 December 2022,"Exciting, Charismatic, and highly Innovative","Never let it be said that innovation is dead in movies. Sure all that need be said may have already been said in a thousand movies, or books that are as old as the Bible. But that is no reason for us to be lazy and rehash everything exactly the same way. It's possible to say the same thing in a different manner. And that's exactly what this movie does. It's basically a family drama, and the symbolism are way too clear for anyone to miss. A lesser movie would've made the mistake of underestimating its audience by spoon feeding them rubbish information that's clearly way too easy to understand, in an attempt to make themselves look smarter. On the other hand, if a pretentious filmmaker had taken the movie, it would've ended up being too ambiguous and self serious. Thank God that was not the case. This movie is fun, light hearted and extremely well paced. The action scenes are so energetic that they keep you on the edge of your seat and the comedy is too idiotic that you can't help but laugh. It's an emotional drama that is disguised as an action, scifi and comedy. Hats off to the writers/directors. This is only their second film if you can believe it. And their first one is a masterpiece of it's own, a little movie called swiss army man.

Goddamn, the level of genius is mind blowing. If only others can learn to duplicate such an art, we would've been able to watch more than 3 great movies a year.",8
10 March 2023,Amazing,"The Kung fu is great. The acting is great. The plot is great! This movie is really crazy and intense!! Omg! I can't believe how far this movie pushes the envelope. It really makes you question your own life choices. This movie really has it all. I cannot recommend it enough. Now, the only people I can't recommend it to are people with epilepsy. This movie does have a lot of flashing lights and fast moving images, so that's something that should be considered, but I think if you don't have epilepsy then you should definitely check it out. This movie has made me excited to see the Oscars again, and I haven't been excited for the Oscars in a long time.

9 March 2023,Made an account just to rate this movie,"I love movies, but rarely have I found a movie that didn't feel like Hollywood's cash grab or formulaic. The trailer for EEAAO piqued my interest because of the mention of multiverses and I thought how bad could it be.

I am so glad I saw it in theaters. I enjoyed the movie so much I have seen it in theaters about 5 times bringing different people who have never heard of the movie and left the theater in love with it.

This movie had a lot of passion, talent, and feelings. A visually, character, and plot engaging movie putting you on an emotional rollercoaster.

Ignore the fact that this was partially filmed during the pandemic, and ignore the fact that their budget was only $14 million (average is $50 million) This movie felt real, genuine, and I am so glad that I am part of the universe that gets to experience this movie.

For the best experience, watch the movie knowing as little as you can.",10
5 August 2022,Amazing!,"I do not even know how I like this movie, but I absolutely love it and want to put it up there with my favourites. I will be the n-th person to say this, but this movie really is Everything, Everywhere All at Once. I really do not know how this movie does it, but it has so many things that I think I normally find extremely frustrating, unrealistic or not funny at all, but with this movie I appreciate it, love it and absolutely crack up at it. Of course I have seen movies that made me go through a lot of emotions but this movie is so different. I had so many emotions, and they all felt so complete and separate, it was like I watched 5 movies that all gave me a different emotion.

I think I love how this movie gives you so many options to feel about it. You can think it is a great comedy or action movie, but you can also spend a lot of time analysing all the subliminal messages of the movie and find it an incredibly deep movie. It somehow succeeds at all of it.

I saw someone make the comparison with The French Dispatch (in a negative way). I absolutely hated The French Dispatch (sorry), I found it so boring, it made me go and study. But in a way, I do understand the comparison. I (an absolute layman) think The French Dispatch also tries a lot and tries to make people connect with and get into an absurd movie. To me, The French Dispatch just totally failed at connecting and well, everything.

This review is probably chaotic and all over the place, I apologise, but that kind of is how this movie was for me. And I absolutely loved it! Wow!",10
26 April 2022,Everything Everywhere it was all at once,"Best ADHD representation ever. I cried and I laugh all at the same time.

I get why some of the comedy could be perceive as cheap but in retrospective that is what happen to some brains when they are bored and they try to make sense of mundane situations. Yes is like using apples to do maths but it's an ADHD brain using the most basic language to explain how it works.

Just sit, relax and don't try to make it into the masterpiece that it already is, because you might not get it.

It is brilliant!

2 October 2022,The best movie of the year?,"After some time and many recommendations, I have finally seen the film and now understand why it is so positively received.

Well, the film is very emotional, its concept is absolutely bizarre, it plays with several genres and above all it is also crazy, even a bit punk.

Ah, and Michelle Yeah is simply fantastic!

And when do we see crazy things anymore?

You see, too rarely.

But it's also, above all, a family drama that focuses on a mother's relationship with her daughter in an incredible way.

And the film is a great philosophical work about how to be your best self.

So, it's worth seeing.

Go and watch it in a movie theatre.",9
20 May 2022,It's the best movie this year,"Any movie that beats this movie this year should be this movie which is 1 minute longer, I have never hungered to rate a movie 10 as this, please watch it, if you don't like it watch it again, you might have missed something, it's undeniably good. I enjoyed the way they presented the concept of the multiverse; funny, crazy and amusing. I don't know a good person with good judgment that can rate this movie lower than 8. I really wish this movie would get more attention and probably win an Oscar.

28 March 2023,A Brutally Honest Review.,"I am a middle-aged male cinephile. I've seen my share of movies. This one made my fingers itch to write a review, halfway into the film. I managed to see the whole of it and oh boy I am pissed off! And let me tell you why.

There are some things that bother me but I will gladly give them a pass, like:
The script is a deliberate mess, it is supposed to be, fine I get it!


The style is like Kung Fu Hustle, with a hidden ""serious"" meaning. Sometimes silly, sometimes rude, sometimes even offensive to the eyes, mixed with some ""forced"" drama to make an impact, give a touch of superficial reasoning to the story. Sure, I can live with that.


But seven freaking Oscars?











And now for the cherry on top!



Three Oscars for acting! For Best Female Lead, and both supporting actor and actress? Seriously? It makes no sense! I mean the script is so ridiculous that almost anyone could recite the lines and do the gestures and the funny faces. And even when the cast has a chance to connect with the audience, the script being so over the top surreal, deprives them of this opportunity and get lost again.

Please, the Oscars have become a joke. I have nothing against the actors, but did they deserve Oscars? No! Why? Because using the Academy's current logic Jamie Lee Curtis could have gotten an award for Halloween, Ke Huy Quan for Goonies, and Michelle Yeoh for Crouching Tiger, or even James Bond for all I care, it would make so much more sense than winning for their work in this production. Stephanie Hsu who was also nominated for best female support role, was the only one that brought some consistant acting skills to this movie.

Seasons change, trends come and go, the world changes, but for this movie to be considered the best Hollywood has to offer right now, that is simply ludacrous and it tells you a lot about the state of the Arts in general.

Promoting this movie as the best of the best, it shows you how much Hollywood care about quality, which is not at all! It only cares about things like being ""inclusive"" and ""open minded"", and that's another reason why people don't watch movies in the theaters anymore. Why would a family of 3 paying tickets for this movie... They would feel ripped off, of their money and their time they could have spent elsewhere having actual fun, I do.

Concluding, I don't know how to rate this. A 5 out of 10 is the best I can do, just because the movie is supposed to be weird and it suceeds in that.",5
23 May 2022,"Not sure what it's about, but I love it","Underneath all the multiverse romping, martial arts and VFX is a very deep story about how the buildup of daily emotional clutter can blind the relationship between kindred souls.

This is the Matrix, but it is also something else deeply interesting.

I didn't know Hollywood could still make movies like this.

9 February 2023,Actually Everything,"Everything that could ever be said about this movie has probably already been said, but I think this is an amazing change of pace for Action as a genre and as a whole. It's a genre that has been, in my opinion, dying for many years, run into the ground with the last 20 generic marvel releases, but this is something new, refreshing, and a poignant breath of life brought back into the genre. It combines everything any audience could possibly be interested in, tells a story that is relevant and relatable yet still says something novel about our lives and our existence. Perfectly blended and just stunning to look at and look through. The fact that is it so easy to watch despite being so remarkably dense speaks to how much thought and care was put into the writing and editing.

24 April 2022,Crazy but unique story,"At last, someone came up with a movie that had me think, laugh and mesmerized. The boys in the family are usually critical about the movies I suggest and this one was an exception! My entire family loved it! It was crazy, funny but unique movie. Not a typical cookie cutter kind but eccentric. It's a bit too long though. Would have cut down to 2 hrs instead. Actors were great! Will recommend this movie. Worth my time and money. Two thumbs up!

15 March 2023,Oh the hype,"I guess i was expecting a fantastic movie that would blow me away.

The trailer, the reviews and the awards. This movie must be awesome!

Right, reality check.

In my view it's ok, i laughed sometimes, i had a weird expression sometimes, felt like i was on drugs sometimes, i got bored a few times aswell.

I love Michelle Yeoh and here movies. The Children of Huang Shi, Crouching tiger, true legend and Fearless (even tho she was uncredited) Awesome movies that i tend to watch over and over.

Everything Everywhere All at Once will be forgotten fast for me. I will probably never watch it again, and i will never understand why o earth this movie gets so high rating and reviews.",4
13 July 2022,A foooking masterpiece,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

4 April 2022,Fresh Approach to the Multiverse,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a fresh take on the quickly staleing multiverse idea that is now commonplace in the cinematic world. It follows Evelyn Wang, a mediocre woman who is capable of extraordinary things, and her journey through the multiverses. In exploring who she truly is, she must go on a journey of self- discovery, acceptance and pure unadulterated adventure.

24 April 2023,The perfect movie exists?,"I don't ever review movies but this one is dear to me.

It is all at once the chaos_and_ order of what genius looks like. It makes me feel emotions I can hardly describe, ranging from joy and wonder of discovery and comedy to the deep human connection where I am crying my heart out at recognising the familial connection between the main characters and their complex emotions.

Yes, I am a grown man, in fact often robotic in not showing emotions openly as society has designed me, but present me with the perfection of emotional range that is this movie and you remind me who I truly am (somewhere).

To the directors, thank you for this incredible gift to humanity. I cannot wait to see what you create next.

25 April 2023,Worst movie ever,"No clue why this movie got so many Oscars.

It's one of the few I actually walked out of.

So, arguably I shouldn't review it, because I didn't see the whole movie.

But with so many 9/10 and 10/10 reviews, this should have been the movie you want to watch over and over again. Well, absolutely not.

I can only conclude that people didn't understand the movie. But if the critics say it's brilliant, it must be brilliant...

Does Michelle Yeoh deserve an Oscar? Oh, definitely. But it would have been much better if she had received it for one of her really good movies instead of this one.

Waste of time.",1
26 November 2022,"Unique, Thrilling and Heartwarming","Everything, Everywhere, All at Once tackles a very extensively done trope of time/dimension travel however it does it in such a unique way that feels extremely fresh. There is no other movie like this, and the plot; while not shakespearian does a great job of capturing the audience. The film is packed to the brim with comedy, action, adventure and even heartwarming familial bonding moments, it has a little bit of everything. While some parts feel weaker and less focused, the movie as a whole does an excellent job and is definitely worth the watch. Subsequent watches also reveal many things you don't get on the first viewing so that is recommended. While it can be hard to follow along with at times, if you are able to it is one of the best movie experiences of the year.

21 April 2022,A brilliant gonzo masterpiece,"Wow, just wow. Easily one of the most original and stylish films I've seen in years. It's a small family centered drama about the troubles and trials of everyday relationships told in the biggest way imaginable. Funny, touching, intense, full of incredible moments and outrageous gags and bits but ultimately small and touching in such a beautiful and introspective way. I will be thinking about this one for years to come, and it will likely forward me its way into my all time greats list. Go see it immediately if you haven't already.

Yes the beginning is confusing. Yes it's chaotic, a wild ride, yes the hot dogs are weird af

But that's the point. Look at the bigger picture. Stay until the reveal

The acting was top notch,the message even more heartfelt. Michelle Yeoh was beautiful, witty and just perfect

Seriously just watch it. What have you got to lose? Even if it's a hate watch

I guarantee you'll be pleasantly surprised. Hollywood just doesn't make unique films like this anymore and you've got to enjoy it when a gem like this is released.

It is visually stunning, has an incredible concept, is thought provoking, emotional and hilarious. I genuinely can't think of a better film. It was just completely insane overall. It would be easy to think that it wouldn't work because of how out there it was but it totally did work and I loved every second of it! Everyone on screen really gave it their all and I very highly recommend that everyone should watch it as soon as possible. I know that i'm probably gonna be rewatching this a lot of times in the near future.

4 September 2022,I assume acid is like this.,"I loved this film. It was so stupid and so clever. So deep and so silly. It takes a decent amount of time, but what starts out as a comedy, then kung fu flick, turns into a lesson in life which will leave you in tears at its profundity.

The action and comedy serve their own purpose and would be enough to get a decent movie together. This film weaves them seamlessly into a solid and novel plot, though.

A multitude of concepts I've never seen mentioned, let alone explored in movies, are swirled together into something really special.

I really have no idea how a human can imagine this and then film it into reality. A visual and emotional masterpiece like you have never seen, guaranteed.

What a thing to make.",9

17 March 2023,Another baffling movie that makes you wonder why it won anything,"To think this rubbish film won an Oscar is crazy. I felt like the movie couldn't have ended soon enough and to make it worse its 2 hours + long and broken into 3 parts. Like many ""Hollywood hype"" movies they are rightfully forgotten over time. This movie will be known for ""Hot dog fingers"". There is nothing else in this movie that is worthy of even remembering beyond that. I can't imagine anyone wanting to see this movie more than once I sitting down to talk about their favorite scene. This movie is all over the place. The plot goes off into too many directions. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to be or what the message is because it has several and none of them are enough to keep you awake and watching.

This could have been a much better movie just like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" a movie that no one liked and only remember because it wasn't a Kung Fu film but was marketed as one. Instead it was a love story people who wanted to see a Kung Fu film got tricked into watching.

We'll that about it on my thoughts for this film. I can't wait to forget it and mostly I already did after watching it. It was boring.",3
30 December 2022,Best move ever filmed?,"This may be the best movie I have seen in my 40 year old life. I didnt expect much of it and just put it on because the trailer seemed interesting.

It started little slow and I thought it will be an okay movie to see before sleep. I was so wrong.

There was wonderfull after wonderfull scenes that my eyes couldnt believe. And then the dialogue and story, my brain was working overtime with processing it all.

When the movie ended I was just sat there with my mouth open. I had a hard time sleeping that night and just was processing the movie in my mind.

This is the greatest thing I have ever seen on the screen and I am thankful to be alive in a time to see something so incredible.

This took my top 1 movie of all time and Donnie darko got pushed to nr 2.",10
20 April 2022,Philosophically shallow but beautifully executed,"Probably the most original take on optimistic nihilism ever put on film. The movie does a great job of conveying the everything, everywhere, all-at-once-ness that the protagonist is experiencing. Masterfully assembled set pieces come together in a way where the end result is greater than the sum of its parts. Feels a little longer than it needs to be since the message being conveyed is shallow. Worth the price of a matinee ticket.

For me this movie turned out to be an unexpected surprise, the plot although building in complexity thoughout the movie has an ending that for me was totally unexpected yet relatively simple (sorry trying not to give spoilers away) and I think a lot of people globaly can and will relate to the finale - be exhausted but will relate. Jamie Lee Curtis - hardly recognisable, I gave it an 8 as I still dont understand ""hot dog fingers"" and probably never will. Everything Everywhere All at Once is the perfect title for this movie, enjoy.

28 January 2023,Best Form of Any Storytelling Ever!,"When I first watched Everything Everywhere All at Once, I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. But after rewatching it after some time, I am convinced that it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across. Granted, I haven't watched, read or played every movie/show/play, book or game ever created in the many languages that exist. But of the significant portion of my life I have spent experiencing stories and my subjective & biased parameters for what an exceptional form of storytelling should ideally be based on, I am certain that this movie is the best I've come across yet.

Why do I think that?

Because it combines the most investigated philosophical question of the purpose of life, the most complex metaphysical theory of multiverses and the most consistently prevalent emotions of hope & despair, all together, in 150 minutes that span almost every storytelling genre there is.

And it does this with a series of truly extraordinary & powerful acting performances, elegantly simple yet extremely compelling dialogues, absurdist yet coherent editing & transitions and one of the most narratively complementary cinematography ever.

Furthermore, the exceptionally intelligent use of various styles of humour, balanced with a metaphorical yet deeply compassionate use of relationships, to construct a narrative that - though may appear comically-absurd & entertaining on a casual first-watch - is actually so much more; being consistently deliberate, methodical & profound on a second viewing.

All this coalesces into a unique emotional journey - with an abundance of excellent humour - that inevitably transitions to a rollercoaster ride of hope crescendos & despair diminuendos, while offering convincing justifications for these ebbs and flows, concluding in an extremely cathartic & appropriate ending.

Everything Everywhere All at Once - as the title suggests - is truly a story about everything, everywhere, told all at once. It's the most conclusive story of existence. And as cliched and inaccurate its ultimate moral may seem, it ingeniously conveys it in the single most hopeful & captivating manner possible.

And that's why it is the best form of any storytelling I have ever come across.",10
27 March 2023,Nothing Nowhere Never,"Watching this movie was an experience I would have rather not had. Sometimes we see, read, or experience something that just does not resonate. Because we are individuals, we will respond to art differently. There will be some kinds of art that some of us will love and some of us will hate. This is an example of art that was destined to be devisive. Taste and sensibility are everything.

I think it would be very difficult to be neutral about this film, or give it a 5. It's either a 10 or a zero. Was it made well? Yes. Was it well acted? Yes. Were the music and special effects well crafted? Yes. On these elements we can be objective, and positive, and probably agree.

But without being judgmental, and only subjective, was it interesting? No. Was it funny? No. Was it clever? No. Is it worth describing? No. Is it worth a second viewing, or even a second thought? No.

But that's just my opinion, as a sentient individual.

So, for me, It was two+ hours of my life I will not get back.",1
13 November 2022,"Strange film, but can't turn my eye's away.","This is a very strange film, but I can't seem to turn my eye's away for fear I'll miss something important or well, strange. But, stick with it, it will begin to make sense toward the end in the last quarter.

Great casting and I was super surprised and pleased to see Ke Huy Quan in one of the primary roles; always considered him an interesting child actor but then he seemed to disappear from the screen. As he has been reported to have said that after his childhood roles, there just didn't seem to be any opportunities for him again in acting, so he turned to behind the scenes. Would be really interesting to see him reprise his role as 'Short Round' in the next Indiana Jones film, but now as an adult.

Michelle Yeoh is of course impeccable in anything she's in, and Jamie Lee Curtis is a hoot as a government IRS agent. Story line with so many costumes and scenery changes must have been as confusing to keep up with as it was to watch it all. Expect I'll be seeing different scenes of the film in my memory again and again for a few days.

It's an odd film, might even consider Art House worthy, but I'm hoping you will also think it was worth sticking through all the crazy scenes and costumes till you get to the end and the purpose of the film. Best quote is 'Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on. '",8
24 July 2022,A Breath of Fresh Air,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

9 August 2023,A Multiverse of Madness,"I give this 8 out of 10, because it dares to wrestle with the nature of our existence. Kudos for that! But it doesn't leave you in a good place. Here is its worldview: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once; Multiverse of madness; Infinite options; Nothing matters; Be kind; Self-loathing: We are little pieces of (trash), Each new discovery makes us realize how insignificant and small we are; What matters most is human connection; A renewed appreciation for your place in the universe through nihilism; Appreciate the few good moments of your life because when you die you won't exist; A little apartment above a failing laundromat means you have somehow failed, are miserable, and have not experienced life.

Question: How do people stand to live with such a depressing, unnecessary worldview? No wonder people are out of their minds with despair.

Another worldview: A Few Things, Right Here, At this Moment; Universe of reality; One unifying loving purpose; Everything matters; Be humble; Self-respect: We are the crown of creation and made in the image of God; Each new discovery makes us realize how wondrous God's creation is (marvel at the wonders of this vast universe) and how special we are; What matters most is our connection with God and how that allows us to connect with other people; A renewed appreciation for your place in the universe through faith (positive expectation); Appreciate the good moments of your life because they are a foretaste of eternity; A little apartment above a failing laundromat means you have experienced most what if means to be alive and in no way limits your capacity for joy.

In commenting on life and the nature of existence, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) does a much better and more life-affirming job. If that is too sweet for you, the on-target satire ""Don't Look Up"" (2021) achieves a similar but less cynical epiphany than EEAAW, when Dr. Mindy says, ""We really did have everything, didn't we? I mean, when you think about it."" Well said!",8
1 August 2023,Must watch for parents who feel disconnected from their kids,"Everything everywhere all at once is jaw dropping amazing. It's funny, it's smart and it's emotional. First, the outfits just blew me away. It was all so well done and beautifully made. You had these ridiculous scenes where you're staring at the screen and going 'what the hell is going on??' and then the next minute you're in tears. It's bittersweet. It reminds you that we're all just people on a rock in a large universe trying our best.

I especially loved how different it is than most main stream movies. The main character is a middle aged asian mom who's struggling with her taxes and daughter. She's an immigrant and culture shock still hits her hard 20 years later. Her daughter is gay and rebellious and nothing like she'd ever seen back home.

I highly recommend watching this if you're Asian American as it definitely hits very close to home. I recommend it to parents of LGBTQ+ children who are struggling to understand their kids.",10

In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

29 May 2022,I am in the thumbs down brigade.,"I do not need to work this hard.

Firstly; continually switching between English and subtitles is tiresome, and makes it hard to focus on the film.

Some of the situations felt a bit silly.

The rapid switching between scenes is jarring, and there is a general air of incoherence about the whole film; in an irritating way, not one that endears.

26 May 2022,"This movie definitely deserves an Oscar nomination, maybe even Best Picture!!!","I'm not a sensual person, but this film has made me cry. Thanks to the director for bringing this incredible and stunning movie to us in 2022, such a terrible year. It makes me believe that this is still something I can like, someone I can love. And there is no obstacle I cannot overcome because I have family and friendships helping me find the point I live and stopping me from falling into the ""Bagel."" This movie also let me see the possibility that Chinese culture and American culture can be well combined. Finally, I hope that the director team can continue to bring us more works, and I hope that the film can get a good box office in the world so that more people can see this excellent work.

30 September 2022,Every decision you make can create a different reality!,"As the teachings of Albert Einstein show us how we can create our own reality, this movie gives us an amazing insight into the cause and effect our actions can have within our own lives and the entire multiverse. If you've explored the possibility of how every decision we make can take you in a different direction and create an alternate version of yourself, then you'll love it. Michelle Yeoh does an amazing job of playing a stressed out wife running round on the hamster wheel of life barely catching her breath. She is presented with another version of her husband that takes her on a journey of her other selves whilst he teaches her how to switch realities and draw in the gifts and talents from other versions of herself to change the reality she is living. It really is very enlightening! A mix of sci fi, comedy, romance and some great psychological insights as it explores the relationship with her family and how she came to be at the crossroads in her life that wakes her up and explores what's 'out there'. Sometimes it feels completely crackers but I found myself laughing out load and totally aligning with those moments. A treat if you like to stretch your mind and think outside the box!",10

27 March 2023,Action packed every moment.,"This movie packed a punch for sure. I loved the pace, however I gave it 8 stars instead of ten because i know I'll have to rewatch it a second (or even third) time to truly understand what was happening. Very very good film, regardless, and I'll be happy to watch it again.

This movie tells the story of an immigrant couple and their adult first-generation daughter as they navigate the balance between tradition and acceptance, all while dealing with inter-dimensional time travel. There were touching moments, nonsensical moments, happy moments, and moments that made me sad. It was all about growing and letting go of the past. As always A24 does a fantastic job. A.

29 December 2022,Weird and Wonderful,"What a conjointed and weird movie yet beautiful. Done in three parts and brought beautifully together in the end. Though it can be somewhat scattered, it is brought back gracefully to a meaning of what live is... What you make and think it is! It makes you think of what is and is not what is important in your life.

It is both action and life affirming. What more could you ask of a movie. Though I, personally will not agree that family always comes first (personal experience) love does!!! Love, this exhalts all above everything. It is what gives meaning. It is that love for what we bared and gives fruit to the future of humanity that makes it all worthy! LOVED IT.

A family with drama, like any other family. You find something to relate to, and that's what brings it to life. Colorful, playful, hilarious, deep and touching to ones heart.

12 March 2023,We ALL Know Why This is Getting Raves,"Hollywood is imploding - their business model of creating good movies to lead viewers to theaters has been crushed and replaced with streaming television.

In their struggle to remain relevant, they have also found that their ""old white boy"" setup has come under fire. In their quest to reverse that stigma, it has been declared that every film made by, starring, directed by, or produced by minorities MUST be hailed as the next Citizen Kane.

Everything Everywhere All At Once is not Citizen Kane by any stretch of the imagination. It's not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly wasn't deserving of the hype that has been placed upon it. I have little to add to the other reviewers who gave this movie around 3-4 stars, so I'll let those reviews speak for me.

To be honest, I wouldn't care if every single movie nominated for an Academy Award was done by minorities - more power to them, I say. However, race alone should bear no weight in deciding what is considered outstanding. As much as I hate to say it, this is clearly what has happened here.

Three stars for originality, and that's being quite generous.",3
24 April 2022,Nice Experience,"Every moment was worth watching. Overall it was fun, some scenes were sad and they handled the subject well. I will watch it again soon. I liked the actors, the stage designs, the pace of the movie, everything. Definitely watchable.

16 March 2023,Thought provoking.,"This movie may not have been the most critically acclaimed, especially for an Oscar winner, but the things that I thought after watching this movie were surreal, and dare I say even life-changing.

Everything Everywhere All At Once is a euphoric experience that should not be missed. The morals are clear and so simple that this movie meddles in your mind for a long time. You start to think about what actions could've been taken to make another person feel better.

In conclusion, this movie is a must-watch, surreal experience that will change your perspective on what we call life, and others around us.

30 July 2022,An absurd comedy with great performances and is a technical feat,"This movie is overwhelming and excessive but in a good way. Although it does become too much at some points, it's only adds, and may even be necessary, for the movie to have the same impact that it does. While the moral of the movie may seem a little cheesy, that doesn't make it any less powerful.

8 April 2023,One of the most original films of the decade,"I was getting tired of movies trying to be overly serious and intellectual. So when I saw Everything Everywhere All At Once, I was pleasantly surprised to find a film that blended humor, action, love, and insanity in a way that kept me thoroughly entertained.

What sets this movie apart is its unique take on the ""parallel universe"" genre. While this type of storytelling isn't necessarily new, Everything Everywhere All At Once exemplifies the chaos that it creates in the most captivating way possible. The film's creative use of parallel universes adds a fresh and exciting perspective to the genre, making it stand out from other similar movies.

Another great thing about this film is that it constantly keeps you on the edge with its non-stop action and unexpected twists. At the same time, it manages to seamlessly integrate moments of heartwarming romance and comedy, creating a well-rounded viewing experience.

I'm thrilled that Everything Everywhere All At Once won the Oscar's. This film is a true gem and deserves all the recognition it has received. If you're in the mood for an entertaining and thought-provoking movie that's unlike anything you've seen before, then this is definitely one to watch, if you are over 45 years old then probably you are not going to like it.",10
21 March 2023,Far less than I hoped for,"I went in to watch this film after reading good reviews, apparently it was the film of 2020. It was disappointing, repetitive and felt like another trip down the worn out Marvel lane. I cannot believe it won an Oscar.

Perhaps the acting was good, maybe, I just can't get my head around how disappointed I was in it. I felt like I had seen it all before, which in many ways I had but was told it was original and fun. The dialogue was ridiculous, the plot was all over the show and I need to repeat, how on earth did it win the big prize and the Oscars. It's the first film in my 50 years of watching Oscars I just can't wrap my head around what made it good.

29 April 2023,This Review Doesn't Matter...,"...in fact, nothing does. You can't argue with this perspective having watched this film, but as whacky as it was, the underlying principle is sound and likely entirely fundamental to this strange arrangement of particles and passage of time that we call our universe. This film will leave you wondering things about the nature of existence that you never even thought to wonder, and asking questions you never even thought to ask. For those that resonate with this way of thinking, you will surely appreciate this is a very cleverly written film, portrayed in a manner suitable for various audiences. All I know is; I'm really glad I don't have hot-dog fingers in this universe.

18 August 2022,It's possible,"Much has been said about the multiverse and this film shows it in a unique way.

Exposing ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" that it is possible to make a script that teaches you without being childish, rude or disrespectful to the audience that watches it. Which currently has been the routine.

And by the way, nothing here is common, each scene is well-crafted with a purpose.

The design work and photography are incredible, making even with the budget much smaller than the big productions achieve the result beyond expected.

Sound professionals teach about immersion.

A masterpiece of hilarious scenes and with a lot of sensitivity.",10

Michelle yeoh is absolutely amazing in her role and she definitely deserved that best actress Oscar win. The film was packed with emotions and special relationships with a mother and her daughter while still providing a lot of giggles. Yes this movie can be difficult to understand sometimes but it's overall such a fun time. This is a film that I truly believe that it deserved that best picture win ü•á. It was so pleasant to see ke huy quan get the recognition he deserved from this movie (I think he should have won the Oscar for Indy jones and the temple of doom). This film is truly a classic and will remain in people's hearts and memories for decades to come. Oli Thompson xx.

22 April 2022,Crazy and wholesome,"Overall great film with beautiful cinematography. Insane special effects and captivating lighting made the film enthralling.

I gave it an 8 for overall delivery, however I have many critiques.

The film went for about an hour too long, lots of repetitive and strung out scenes.

Lots of childish humour that took away from the important emotional scenes.

Too many pop culture references that made the plot almost ""silly"" for example the bagel concept. Kinda feels like it was written by a grandma who's spent too much time on facebook.

The apparent ""life changing"" messages the film tried to communicate were very obvious and nothing groundbreaking.

The ending was really nice and pulled everything together. The film was beautifully chaotic, and enjoyable watch, but I don't need to see it again.",8
20 May 2022,"Confused halfway, released by the end","I think this film is a compensation, or rather, a realization of ""the road not taken"", you could experience the lives possible that you haven't choose to live in the past, you could see another potential self. Another thing I learn from this film is that we're fluid, it's kind of like the queer theory, you could be any identity if you want. I was stunned especially when I see the two of them become rocks. This is EXACTLY what I want my identity to be in the afterlife, or at least it shows my imagenary self-identity, that I can be EVERYTHING.

Through all the multiverse jumping and weird, nonsensical scenarios this movie brings up, it has a very relatable message which I could personally connect to. It made me both cry and laugh multiple times. It's a really well made movie with both great comedy and a heartfelt message that really hits you hard. I'm usually bored through movies because i had a short attention span but this one had my attention from start to finish. A truly breathtaking movie that I will definitely be rewatching.

I hope it will have all the credit this title deserve.

Acting is overall great. It has a message, directing is great but if I have to take one flow is that is a bit long.

19 November 2022,Multi-layered experimental piece of art,"As human beings, we are taught that we are the only species with the power of choosing. This movie probes into our very complex feelings. We have multiple layers in our dark side. But only one layer to overshine everything about the darkness. The movie offers a very simple solution to our empirical pains.

It's easy to neglect the ones around us and wish for ideal people to have around to fulfill what we lack. However, it takes a lot of courage and sacrifice to stand up for our loved ones. Optimism, not giving up and living all kinds of feelings, good and bad, in a balance. In the end, it's what we are made of; the good and the evil. As a complex species, we are not entitled to be trapped in small boxes. We all have the capacity to have mutual acceptance, tolerance, and understanding. It just takes a bit of courage to risk it and set a foot forward.

It's a movie anyone would connect to and enjoy. But remember to keep your heart open before entering the theatre salon or pressing the play button.",8

5 September 2022,Multiverse of madness...,"This film is weird, really really weird. At many points it feels like it contains all the ideas from pitch meetings that get thrown out when the boss says 'there are no bad ideas'. Though when most would immediately shoot these down and judge the life of whoever blurted them out, this film uses them in a chaotic, almost beautiful way.

While the concept of a multiverse has been beaten to death a bit recently (particularly with Marvel), this film commits like it had nothing to loose. It explores so many different aspects of multiple realities and existence to the max that it's painful to try to take it all in. It builds and builds and builds into more and more unthinkable scenarios but keeps a personal, meaningful core throughout. Where certain (marvel) movies would keep building the stakes to a destructive cgi monster fight this never looses touch with what story it's actually trying to tell.

This is a remarkable film with a unique take on an idea, incredible visuals, elaborate stunts, perfect performances, and a touching story to follow through.

(You need to be in a very particular mood to really enjoy this film. I wasn't lying about the weirdness but it does have purpose and charm if your up for it. If not maybe try it again another time or look into the work behind it or maybe it's not for you. All good options) :)",9
5 November 2022,Beautiful Movie,"I saw all the negative reviews on here but people failed to get the plot of the movie. I never wrote reviews but people calling this overrated is just dumb. This movie beautifully potrays to appreciate all of the things that you have that you went through to get to this point in life, maybe you'd feel like things would have been better if you took a different route but it is what it is so stop overthinking and just look at the bigger picture things will fall into place and you will feel a part of something bigger than your own little conscience.

What you are is just a product of your decision.

I want a refund of the part of my life I wasted on this. Why did anyone think it was good? There is nothing of quality or interest here at all. The fanny pack is the only interesting part as this is an amusing Goonies reference to Data. The Oscar panel need to stop trying to rate movies as they have no idea. First Parasite now this rubbish. The acting was poor with the action scene's particularly with Key Huy Quan who is clearly no Jackie Chan.

18 August 2022,Incredible Story Telling,"This film hit for me on all notes. The script, the direction, the acting (Michelle Yeoh really shines), the dialogue and the moral of the story are all so well done.

I watched with a diverse group, different ages, sexes and different tastes in films. All of us loved it. The movie was interpreted differently by the different people.

I feel this is what happens when producers, agendas and the ""Hollywood corporation"" let a the writers and actors just do what they do do best.

Highly recommended watch for everyone...it has something for all us.

I love all the characters in the movie, love the creativity of the filmmaker, the way they make it look fancy on a simple and emotional story background.

From the beginning of 2023 until now, to be honest I have watched almost all the blockbusters film as well as the works of the famous film company. But it doesn't make me feel anything special anymore.

12 April 2023,Incredible,"We truly do live in Idiocracy. Society is too far gone. When a movie like this wins multiple oscars, awards, and gets highly rated, there is no going back to the norm. One scene in particular makes it clear how depraved people are nowadays to enjoy this. A random bong rip from a gun, random ketchup bottle, then huge dildos used as weapons, and then finally the ridiculous sausage fingers and mustard scene among so much other garbage. Apparently this randomness is what passes for a multiple oscar winning movie now. I can't tell if this is meant to be artsy or intentionally insulting to humanity. It truly feels like a movie for Idiocracy.

21 May 2022,The best of the best,"I give it a 10 based on how imaginative it is but frankly, if you are into philosophy and science you would give it 11/10 with the extra point coming from another universe. Can't imagine how well a complex subject such as the chaos theory can be implemented smoothly into a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone like this. Ah well, maybe it's thanks to the sausages (wink wink). This movie is miles ahead of most other attempts to explore the multiverse subject.

24 March 2023,The best film of 2022,"The Way this movie is handled and The absolute superior performance of all the actors makes this the absolute best movie of 2022. It is abstract, yet easy to understand. You Can follow the plot but still have a lot to Think about. I love all The small references to pop culture and that it still keeps a light tone even when dealing with topics of nihilism and despair. It is an absolute journey to watch and an enjoyable one at that. I Can highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates films like interstellar, fight club, inception, tenet and similar films. A supreme viewing pleasure and food for thought.

23 March 2023,Well deserved Oscar for Ke Huy Quan.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",10

12 March 2023,Garbage with special effects,"I can't believe this is another movie without substance.

The scenario could have been interesting but nothing makes sense.

The whole concept is used ad nauseam to try to create a story but everything falls flat and this is just some crazy things put together.

It might have been a students film like what we did before when we were young.

The main actor is good but a little bit unnerving, the main actress is totally cringe and the way she acts is fake. Other characters are poor so no need to mention them.

Completely overrated. Yes I don't understand the positive reviews, I'm not young, I saw maybe 10000 movies, this one I will forget very quickly.",5
10 July 2022,Made me cry,"I do need to rewatch this movie because there was so much to process. I loved that though. I loved how much detail there was.

I appreciated the light shined upon generational differences and trauma. I loved the family healing and that is why i cried and loved this movie too. There was so much meaning and symbolism intertwined everywhere.

It's definitely a movie I would recommend and rewatch as well!

18 May 2023,"Embracing the Eclectic Brilliance of ""Everything Everywhere All at Once","As a movie enthusiast who eagerly explores the vast array of cinematic offerings, it never fails to surprise me when people fail to appreciate a film as magnificent as ""Everything Everywhere All at Once."" To those who find fault with this extraordinary piece of artistry and fail to grasp its brilliance, I can only assume they either lack the capacity to appreciate true cinematic genius or simply have not encountered a film that has left such an indelible mark on their hearts and minds.

""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is an audacious cinematic marvel that defies traditional narrative conventions and immerses viewers in a kaleidoscopic tapestry of emotions, ideas, and visual grandeur. Its unapologetic commitment to pushing boundaries and challenging the norms of storytelling elevates it to a realm of artistic excellence that few films dare to tread.

One cannot begin to dissect the remarkable impact of this film without acknowledging the breathtaking performance of its lead actress. Michelle Yeoh's portrayal of Ma, an ordinary woman thrust into extraordinary circumstances, is an acting tour de force. Her ability to seamlessly transition between multiple dimensions and personas is nothing short of remarkable, displaying a depth and range that is awe-inspiring. Yeoh's captivating presence on screen is alone worth the price of admission.

Furthermore, the film's non-linear narrative structure is a stroke of storytelling genius. It weaves together disparate threads of reality and imagination, blurring the lines between past, present, and future. This nonlinear approach immerses viewers in a mind-bending journey that challenges conventional notions of time and space, inviting us to question the very fabric of our existence.

The visual effects in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" are nothing short of mesmerizing. The seamless integration of practical effects and computer-generated imagery transports the audience to realms of imagination that feel tangibly real. From gravity-defying action sequences to mind-bending cosmic landscapes, the film delivers a visual spectacle that ignites the imagination and leaves a lasting impression.

But perhaps the most profound aspect of this film is its exploration of universal themes. Through the lens of a middle-aged woman thrust into a multiverse of infinite possibilities, the film tackles profound questions about identity, purpose, and the interconnectedness of all things. It serves as a potent reminder that, despite our seemingly ordinary lives, each of us possesses the potential to be a catalyst for change and the hero of our own stories.

To dismiss ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" as anything less than a masterpiece would be a disservice to the art of cinema. Its innovative approach to storytelling, remarkable performances, and visual splendor set it apart as a groundbreaking work of art that deserves all the accolades it has received. This film pushes boundaries, challenges perceptions, and expands the horizons of what cinema can achieve.

In conclusion, for those who cannot see the brilliance in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" I implore them to open their minds and embrace the sheer audacity and beauty of this cinematic gem. It is a testament to the boundless creativity of human imagination and a reminder of the transformative power of art. To truly appreciate this film requires an open heart and a willingness to embrace the extraordinary.",10
27 May 2022,11 of 10,"All my life I felt none one really understand what I think and feel. Then this movie was created. It is like someone has opened my head and looked directly on my mind. I'm glad I lived to watch this jewel. I would give an 11 rating if possible. What a piece of art. Chaotic, funny, depressing, cute... all at once. Nothing matters.

23 March 2023,Does reversing stereotypes help prevent them?,"A version of Kung Fu Panda's theme about self worth. Attention to detail insufficient to understand the costumes and their meanings, prompting multiple viewings. The rocks in the movie didn't really need eyes but found them as part of self-worth unnecessary for human beings. The slightly foolish display of pompous circumstance is distracting.

The subtle respect for sexual expression is probably necessary considering Chinese culture and family values and my sharing their woes in terms of change in the context of billions of people. The amount of similarities in terms of American culture overshadows the protagonists' feeling homesick which seems a little intentional in terms of its screen time.

24 May 2022,Style over substance,"Another example of a incoherent and weak storytelling, weird shifts in tempo and bad exposition after people become even more confused.

Besides two fight scenes I was bored and annoyed to death by the film. There was only one scene I enjoyed very much about two stones sitting on a ledge of a canyon.

9 July 2022,Kung Fu Hustle + a Hallmark movie about a frustrated teen finding reconciliation with her parents,"At its core, it's a simple, vague feel-good movie plot with a helluva lot of spectacle thrown on it. That spectacle is some of the most imaginative and wild and entertaining spectacle I've seen in years.

It never reaches the emotional depths or peaks of a similarly surreal dramas (Being John Malkovich, Sorry to Bother You, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), and it doesn't have enough combat choreography to be what most wushu fans would consider to be a martial arts movie, but it sits nicely in its unique space as a wild and unforgettable movie.

15 March 2023,The Best Film of 2022,"EEAAO is without a doubt the best film of 2022!!!! The authenticity in its story and performances are like none you can find anywhere else. Up & Coming actress Stephanie Hsu is a force to be reckon with and it shines through in her outstanding performance as the villain Jobu Tupaki. The nuances in her performs l e from the fluctuations in her delivery of lines to the raw emotions she expressed as Jobu longing for someone to feel what she feels. Not only are the performances amazing so is the cinematography with inspirations from the greats like Wong Kar Wai shine through in this masterpiece of a film.

10 December 2022,The fact that this film is polarising people makes it even better,"The fact that this movie is splitting people in to two categories of either loving or disliking it, to me, makes it even better.

If you like the typical American movie with the antagonist who reaches point of no return, in a universe where it is clear to distinguish who the bad guy and the good guy is? Then this is not your movie.

To me this movie is not an attempt to make art, it is art. So again, if you're the type who easily gets bored at museums and don't have much experience or knowledge about art? Oh boy is this not the movie for you.

It is definitely an experience worth watching but it is not for everyone, witch doesn't make it bad. I think it was a really good experience and the trippy effects and everything was succ√©d√©s very well!",9
15 August 2022,Existential,"There is no words that I could see Serve this film justice . This was a truly incomprehensible experience.

The acting was phenomenal and did a beautiful job at conveying the character's emotions. The picture was surreal and every editing choice was perfect ; truly delectable.

The message was definitely received due to its delivery being extraordinary.

I have taken many life lessons from this.

This is 12 monkiesish but bonus number 1 no Bruce Willis and number 2 you don't have to follow it. Sit back and enjoy the soundtrack aswell as the hot dog fingers. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as always aswell.

A real unexpected gem.

15 March 2023,I didn't realise how many things I disliked about this film...,"It's the film version of that 'whacky' cringe-inducing office poster: ""You don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps!"" Some personal gripes: The name 'Waymond' which comes over as a 'Chinglish' mispronunciation of Raymond. Why did people not find this offensive?

Michele Yeoh's limited emotional expression, or so it felt to me.

The excessive fight stuff, a lot of it in this film felt so unnecessary, repetitive and boring.

Not an issue for most I guess, but crude body humour is a turn-off for me, it's hard for me to get past my disgust. Don't put things in your arses, people! Modern obsession with sex toys gives me pause. Seems juvenile.

And having considered possible reasons why I disliked the film so much I *takes deep breath* don't think the acting was very good. There was something lacking. Also and I suppose this makes me shallow, but everyone seemed so unattractive, bland at the very least. I expect that was to emphasize that they were 'ordinary people' but being 'ordinary' does not preclude being attractive, and I think you need that element in a feature film.

I don't tend to agree with modern Academy Awards in the main, so I suppose this is just an ongoing example of how out of synch I am with the values of that institution.

Is it nitpicking to assert that a species that evolved with hot dog fingers could never have reached the level of technological civilisation portrayed in that 'skit'?

Ke Huy Quan is no Tony Leung. I got second hand embarassment from that part. Anything attempting to match the subtlety of 'In The Mood' is doomed to be cast as parody, not homage. Films like that should be out of bounds, it's rather arrogant to think you can replicate them in such a superficial way.",1
14 August 2022,One of the main contender for oscars,"What can I say about this movie? Many many....people have already praised enough so I cannot add much more in terms of reviewing the movie. But one things is for sure IMO that no other movie is going to stop this movie from winning at least 3-4.oscars if not more. There is a (strong) possibility James Cameron's Avatar: The Way of Water, if released this year, can beat this movie in the race for Oscars.

Oh, now something about the movie. From 2:03:56 to 2:08:57, movie is laced with such emotions and beautiful scenes that one can't stop crying.

If you cares about your loved ones, see this movie. You will definitely enjoy the journey of the characters involved in complexed relationships. But if you somehow don't believe much in building relationships, then this movie is must watch for you to learn a thing or two about the kindness, love and empathy towards your close ones, loved ones and common persons.",9
19 September 2022,Incredible Journey,"Some of the goofiest visual effects, stuntwork, and storytelling I've ever experienced in a film. I'm loosely reminded of the feeling that I had watching movies like Kung Fu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer, and films of the sort. The direction playfully explores a composition of profound themes while simultaneously cutting the tension with orchestrated silliness and mystery. One moment you're trying to link the narratives together as you're frantically following a chaotic story progression, and immediately after you're holding your sides from laughter. By the end of the movie, you cannot help but appreciate the underlying message being told. I would call this film nothing short of a masterpiece, and you would be doing your friends and family a favor by recommending it.

18 March 2023,Omnia Vincit Amor,"So funny, so precise. A perfect mix of everything, everywhere and All at Once. Quirky and yet precise. Kung Fu meets Love Story. Crazy meets perfection.

The actors have really met up to their characters in a way that I haven't seen in a long while. So worth all the Oscars and all the other awards they have been given. If you ask me - a must see. Also to see actors like Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, childhood stars, on the screen again - making such a fantastic appearance makes me smile. Best movie, best film, best story in like a very, very LONG time!

Thank you, please make more movies like this. It will make the world a better place,

Peace!

8 December 2022,speachless,"This movie came out a few months ago, but i only had the time to watch now and damn! Did i lose quite a experience.

The cinematography, choreography and the writing in general is top-notch.

A movie made by quite a small cry with an even smaller budget, but it manages to surprise you with the quality of itself!

The history is fantastic and the imagery very trippy! Funny when it has to be then suddenly serious all over. It makes you cry at the end with tears of joy and sadness altogether. Just seeing Evelyn and Joy fight the whole movie while feeling bad for everyone especially Waymond, i just can't describe everything i felt.

10/10 movie for me, might not be for you, but an amazing movie nonetheless. Best of 2022.",10

26 May 2022,What a bore,"Two hours of contrived (as they all are) martial arts and property destruction with the poor writing poorly camouflaged by constant shifting between scenes. There's a story, sort of, but it's more of a heavy-handed and very long drawn-out parable, or rather as one character says, it's all just swirling bucket of bulls#!t. How anyone gave this more than two stars - how I managed to sit through the whole thing - I'll never understand.

Also it's completely unfunny despite the desperate, relentless attempts at humour almost all the way through. Seriously tedious. Watch at your own peril.

5 September 2022,"Original, funny and clever","In a raft of franchise films and formula moving designed for a focus group this stands out as one or the weirdest, cleverest, funniest films I have seen in long time.

Not saying it's always easy, but that's because it does follow the pack.

The effort and detail that goes in is staggering for something (I'm guessing) without a massive budget. Some scenes probably 1/10 second long with intricate detail, some great gags, funny, sad exciting

Not often an emotional scene with stones in a film, or the answer to a long standing philosophical question, or understanding of the potential violent uses of office equipment

Loved it.

I will simply just put, never have I experienced such a range of emotions back to back to back within a movie before. It will make you laugh, then cry, then laugh again. It was an absolute masterpiece and has skyrocketed up my favorites movie list.

Please go experience this in theater. You won't regret it.

18 March 2023,Probably the best movie I've ever seen,"The visuals in this movie took my breath away, with every scene having dynamic lighting and the costumes were just fantastic. The sound effects were creative and added to the immersion, and the score was beautiful.

This movie was also the funniest I've ever seen. I had tears running down my face for the entire first half, although the second half was a bit more serious. The plot was easy to follow yet engaging, and told a beautiful messages of life without regrets, love, forgiveness, communication, etc.

This movie was beyond enjoyable, and there wasn't a single moment I was bored or confused. Although I've read some contradictory reviews, I think Everything Everywhere All at Once was cinematic perfection and I would watch it a thousand times over. I highly recommend this movie to everybody everywhere :)

Edit: since writing this Ive watched it three more times and my opinion remains unchanged.",10

I don't want to say bad things about this anymore to be frank, just writing for 600 words Rule but Surely, NOT SO SPECIAL AND YET OVERRATED N HYPED!

I loved the Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and action all melded together in a seamless film with a creative storyline and meaningful theme. The editing was extraordinary, as well as the acting and soundtrack. Daniels did such a great job with the script and symbolism and the whole cast was phenomenal! Michelle Yeoh was outstanding! Go watch it now! It's one of the films you can't stop thinking about or talking about when you leave the theater... it's THAT good. It's Oscar worthy for so many categories and it's bonkers, but when you watch it a second time, it will capture your heart even more. Be kind and love one another because we don't know what is going on sometimes.

But I don't know if I didn't get it it's an okay movie everything is pretty good but the story it's seems so random to me and one of those shows that try to look.

But other than that It was pretty good emotional, not stupid, appealing visually and has the Jackie Chan and those kind of Chinese movies vibes.

22 May 2022,"Original, witty, funny and a roller coaster of a ride.","Clever idea with a unique interpretation of the multiverse that dwelled into human goals, tribulations, failures, second chances and many others including what could have been etc. Highly entertaining and it did create some confusion of the various dimensions and timing but you get it the jest of it after a while. Will go as far to say that it could be a cult film, noting its originality and the highly adrenaline induced roller coaster of a ride. I do believe it might not be for everyone as suggested by the rating - out of 10 people, 8.5 of them will love it! The other 1.5 just have to watch it again.

4 July 2023,A bad dream,"Though the production value was high and the acting and choreography was quality, the movie as a whole left me, by the 45 minute mark, wanting to shut it off. It felt like a really bad dream that you wanted to stop and forget. The plot's flavor got lost in the seasonings and I just wanted to spit it out. There were some charming parts at the beginning and I did get a chuckle, but when the sci-fi kicked in it became redundant and ridiculous. My daughter left the room 70 minutes in and I stayed with the hope that it would get better. It got worse. Though there was redemption at the end, again, it got lost in the chaos.

10 December 2022,Amazing movie!,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head.

5 December 2022,"Dr.Strange, Fun, Abstract, Action, Schwarzschild radius and Empathy","EEAAO, From funny moment to badass action to heartbreaking moment each and every moment perfectly grasped the gist of entire story.

Michelle Yeoh & Stephanie Hsu was absolutely phenomenal in thus movie, probably the best acting performance in her career.

Cinematography and Editing is fantastic, stitching the scenes perfectly, no bland shots. The action is innovative and fun. Music score helps convey internal emotion

2 September 2023,An unique experience,"If you want to watch this movie, you have to grab all the movies, cartoons, or whatever you ever saw in your life, and put it aside. Because this film is different from all of them.

I discovered it through social media and when I saw the trailer, I choose to give it a try. Honestly, I was expecting the usual plot: great evil, wants to destroy the multiverse, then there's the hero and blah blah blah. And you know what? That's what I kinda saw. But the way this story was narrated, showed, expressed... I was not ready. During the 2 hours of this movie I laughed, I cried, I felt enthusiastic and so on: everything mixed together.

I was so happy after finishing the movie, finally something that was different, that doesn't copy and paste the main plot and just changes some details but that changes everything and create something else, that doesn't follow the mass: that it's special is own way.

This isn't a story about Evelyn saving everyone, is a story of acceptance, personal growth, regrets, success, mistakes, obstacles and most importantly love.

It makes you learn to cherish what you have, be happy about who you are, to learn from experience and to just live the life, because the truth it's that we're just little and insignificant compared to everything else.

Also I think that the technical part was so good, the music, scenography, acting, costumes, lights: all of those were *chef kiss*

So yeah, I really recommend spending 2 hours of your so insignificant life and just... enjoy everything about it, everywhere you want and maybe with all your friends all at once?",10

1 April 2023,quantum mechanics meets sausage fingers!,"""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" tells the story of a insecure mother who looks down on her husband and considers him useless, while constantly trying to make her father proud and prove herself to him. She has a strained relationship with her daughter who is on the brink of suicide. The movie explores these relationships through multiple universes and the absurdities that come with them.

While all these bonkers can make it difficult for some viewers to watch and follow, it is a wonderful film that questions what success means in life and even delves into the meaning (or meaninglessness) of life itself. It shows us that happiness can sometimes be found in the small, boring and even mundane things in our lives.

For those who are not familiar with comedy-action films like ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" the bizarre elements such as sausage fingers, police officers jumping on dildos, and talking rocks may be too much to handle, and may even leave viewers wondering, ""What am I watching now?"" But if you can see past the absurdities, you will find a beautiful movie that can make even those who do not typically enjoy Far East films contemplate philosophy.

As someone interested in theoretical physics, I also appreciated the references to quantum mechanics and wave functions when explaining multiple universes. The screenwriters and directors did an excellent job in crafting this film.

In short, ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" may be weird, but it is definitely enjoyable.",9
13 March 2023,Diaper Deposit,"Once upon a time in Hollywood, a screenwriter had a role to play in crafting a feature film. But screenwriters have been replaced by ""special effects"" and ""visual effects"" personnel. Here, instead of looking at a picture, we're offered a kaleidoscope. In this age of disorder and decay, a potpourri of fractured imagery is offered for the audience's delectation. In the minds of the filmmakers, some sort of story with some sort of theme is being suggested for the cognoscenti. It is the obligation of the non-judgmental public to put it all together, to craft some sort of coherence out of the visual jigsaw puzzle. Well, I, for one, require payment for my work. On TV, there are plenty of good movies to enjoy again....

2 January 2023,"This movie is for everyone to watch. The message is live our life with love, compassion, understanding, kindness, forgiveness, peace, harmony and joy!","This movie is not really just about one particular person story.

It is the story of everyone.

The message is that we are our own hero, savor, healer.

And the fighting or battle is not about kill the bad guys, as no such thing as bad guys or evil, devil or monster.

It is about fighting to the darkness or negative energy within ourselves, which we have mistakenly absorbed from this 3D world.

And I love the end solution. It is a very profound wisdom. Learn to understand ourselves and others, instead of criticise or judging others and ourselves. We need to relax, live simple as we can and enjoy life.",10

20 December 2022,"Everything I wanted, Everywhere in this movie, more or less all at once.","One of my patreon subscribers hipped me to this last week and last night I saw it. Absolutely f'ing loved it. Talk about a movie that has everything - an emotional core, something to say, comedy, action, pathos, lots of solid performances with great acting, and yes, it's close enough to how the omniverse in Splinters is laid out to be kissing cousins.

Clocks in at about two hours, the violence is never gratuitous, there is no hate speech or harsh language, though it is quite INTENSE in places. Pacing wise not nec. A movie suitable for many children but some will get a lot more out of it than others.

8 June 2022,Best movie of 2022 or maybe even the decade,"I rarely rate movies with 10 stars and I never write reviews, but this stunning masterpiece deserves the highest of praises. It combines a very good script with masterful directing, a perfect score as well as great actors and delivers an absolutely crazy, beautiful and emotional film that left me stunned and crying tears of joy at the end.

Also I loved the kung-fu parts. It has been so long since a movie with great martial arts came out. This one will forever be in my heart as a favorite.

29 January 2023,Love everything about it,"The film is great. The visuals, the acting, the OST, the atmosphere, the uniqueness (god, the humour), the morals, the symbolism, and the everything about it is a gift from the creative minds to the world.

Some people may find it as a 0/10. But I love everything about it, personally. From the crowded atmostphere of repsonsiblites to the morals (don't wanna spoil anything here). It got me emotional there ha ha. It's actually rare for me to get emotional from a product made by any entertainment industries.

I love it so much that I made myself am IMDB account to write this review.

After I watched the film, I felt like I'm back being a kid after watching a great film from a cinema. It's so original! I haven't felt like this for years now (not many. I'm still a teen hehe) and I didn't even watch this film in a fancy ancy cinema. It really got me hooked. Yeah, I found it 'that' (in italic) great.

Will they share the excitement?

Guess what. It worked...

Can't remember the last time I've seen such a terrible movie. The flow, the characters, the scenario.

Omg.

It hurts.

Don't waste your time with that movie. You're better off watching a black screen instead.

P. S.: once upon a time movies like The Godfather were winning the best movie award. Now we have Everything Everywhere all at once. As sad as it gets.",1
5 January 2023,Best movie in 10 years atleast!,"I went into this movie with zero expectations. Went out with a million questions and as an emotinal wrack. The begining is quiet and you get to know the charachters, but as the movie builds up you get more and more action. Its funny original and think worthy. I have never experienced a movie that explain a persons emotinal life more than this.

Loved every second of it! But this isnt one of those movies you can sit with your phone scrolling and glaring at the TV once in a while. You need to be focused and let your self be captured in this movies wricked world. I found my new favourite movie and i hope you do too.

2 May 2022,Truly Everything Everywhere All At Once,"This movie is truly an immersive experience where you follow the main character Evelyn played by an excellent Michelle Yeoh through the multiverse to defeat an unknown force. This movie skillfully utilises symbolism and humour to address themes of nihilism, sacrifice, depression and intergenerational trauma. Uniquely, this film could also be titled Truly All Genres All At Once as it incorporates comedy, drama and action into its core identify as a sci-fi film. There is bound to be many laugh out loud moment as well as many moments of introspections which makes it a cognitive experience as well.

Adding to a mind blowing plot, is the artful directing, sound score and costume design which adds vibrancy to the message being conveyed. This aspect of the film truly makes it a sensory experience. Your brain will undoubtedly be stimulated.

Overall verdict: a cinematic experience once must experience in the cinemas. This will undoubtedly one of the front runners for Best Picture.",10

8 April 2023,The most beautiful mess,"An incredible film that touches you profoundly, but also has a way to entertain you by introducing so much novelty and dynamic energy. The movie brings so much freshness to the screens and leaves you feeling like everything is possible.

A powerful message of healing family trauma and realizing that truths coexist: everything matters and nothing really matters at the same time.

As the movie starts, it feels like it's gonna be like every other Sci-Fi movie you've ever seen, but do not be mistaken. You are bound to be taken on a journey that you don't know how it will end.

What EEAAO manages to do different than other Sci-Fi movies and also the reason why it replays in your brain long after you're out of the theatre, is because it manages to play with your emotions and reflect deeply about your life. Are we living out our highest timeline? Who knows. At the end, we see that even what we think is a merely boring life could have so many silver linings.

This was by far one of my Top 5 favorite movies. Thank you to the Daniels and the incredible crew for your great work!",9
24 May 2022,Greatest use of multiverses,"Very good film, fast pace maybe sometimes too fast for my taste, but nevertheless very interesting concept and in my opinion the best use of the multiverses as it tries to use its full potential. Funny, adventurous and meaningful. Definately, you will miss a lot if you don't watch it.

Also, so great to see an a leading Asian female character! Michelle Yeoh is an amazing actress, and I loved what she brought to this character. Also, the puns and innuendos were great. Overall, great writing, great direction and great acting!

13 September 2023,I love this movie here is why,"This movie was genuinely enjoyable, it was strange yes but that is my style for the most part. This movie is full of overloaded scenes and can make you feel overwhelmed at some points but this adds a lot to the storytelling and gives you a closer connection to the characters.

I love this movie for all of its metaphors and symbolisms, when you look past all of the big in your face stuff the story and meaning is actually quite simple and I think a lot of people overlook that fact.

The acting was phenomenal as well as the rest of the elements of the movie like costume and cinematography, so 7 Oscars wasn't surprising to me, i think this movie was amazing and it lives up to the hype. Which is why I am confused as to why it only got 7.3/10 this movie deserves at least a 9.

I recommend you watch this movie.",10
6 September 2022,Thought it was a Dr Strange knock off but totally different.,"I just watched a movie wondering what it would be about, but was not only, funny, action pack, insightful and beautifully filmed and acted. The underlying story is one of the best examples of this kind of movie I have seen. Worth a watch with a family member or bestie that you love and care for warning at some point in writing the script I believe drugs could have been involved.

Will have to go back and watch it again as I suspect there will be many Easter eggs that I missed first time around.

The acting is really good especially the range that the actors have to express throughout the storyline.

Grandpa is the traditional value and hierarchy. It's judgmental and impossible to please. Daughter is rebellion against the hierarchy and find liberation in emptiness/nihilism. Father is trying to please everyone, suppress himself to take care others first as a way to cope. Mother realized the middle way. Letting go and embrace are the same thing. Suffering and happiness are the same. Everything and everywhere, we are all in it together.

As an Asian, living with parents who don't really know how to express their emotion might be a common memory worldwide. The feeling of disagree, disappointment sometime drive us crazy, making a huge whole inside. I see myself in Joy, and I also see myself in Evelyn, feeling failure for the whole life cuz we didn't do anything. It's a lot of emotion, and I like the way they put together with 3 main multiverse. Good job.

16 October 2022,Best Film of the Year,"Saw this movie with no real idea what to expect I suggest the same to everyone, but I loved this movie. It is So weird and so fun. It is Funny but not distracting so, it is wholesome but not the whole point of it, it is visually stunning in a way you just have to see to understand.

This movie trys to be something different and absolutely succeeds. It is emotionally charged and I even shed a tear or two. Good and believeable family dynamics and acting is upper crust from everyone involved. Again this is my movie of the year and I don't want to spoil anything because it truly has some great moments that need to be seen. Go ahead and try to guess the plot before you see it cause I'd be surprised if you were close.

It's beautiful, heart wrenching, visually stunning and a must watch.

BTW - this is my second IMDB movie review. The last one I wrote was 17 years ago (for the Iranian masterpiece, 'Even Turtles Cry'). Since I wrote that first review, my two sons were born. Having a family is such an amazing experience - and this movie jolts us into appreciating their significance in our respective lives. I would like to write more but tears of happiness keep blocking my view.

But I got it - millions of parallel universes where so many possible outcomes exist and where kindness wins out over evil. But it was so over the top bizarre just for bizarre sake, an endless string of boring fight scenes, tediously dragged on for about 2 hours too long, and a total waste of good actors, it is 2 hours I will never get back. How could this win so many awards? I think the academy has gone insane Or this was a big joke. I feel betrayed. Don't waste your time.

19 March 2023,"Absolutely worth it, the story is a maximalistic dive into something beautiful","No, this movie doesn't have a multiverse just for the sake of it. On paper this story is overcomplicated and convoluted but the beautiful part is the movie, the visuals guide you completely in roughly 2 and a half hours. If you gave someone inexperienced the task to produce the same story it would be a 4 hour boring mess. The risks Daniels took on this movie is way too underappreciated. The non linear storyline, multiple plot lines merging as one, the hidden symbolism in the first act and which is later displayed in a whole lotta multiverse action is well done.

What really sticks out is the acting. The emotions this cast shows is hard to connect with, as it's just an average chinese family with unrelatable middle aged evelyn, her husband, her father and queer daughter but somehow they capture emotions enough to make it relatable

I think the multiverse concept really helps explore the mind boggling nature of human conflict, love and confusion. There's so much that goes on in ones mind when you fall in problems with your loved ones. Even how the story explores non-openmindedness should be studied. Even the humor in this movie is ON POINT.

If you're a big fan of acid trip esque adventure movies trust this one, its captured all essence of it. Only flaw possibly is that you need to be willing to appreciate before criticize. This might be messy, but its the good type of messy.",8
13 June 2022,"Heartfelt, funny, fantastical and relatable.","The base storyline takes a mundane life, and weaves it into this wonderful, fantastical multiverse.

I laughed so many times throughout, and also cried at the incredibly human moments that are also there in bounds.

26 November 2022,Where to begin?,"I didn't quite know what I was getting myself into. I've been waiting to watch this until it hit streaming for free cause I'm frugal, but my god, it was worth the wait! I'll save you all the existential hullabaloo and just tell you this. This movie is something like you've NEVER seen before. At the very center of this acid trip is a story about us. About you. We're all struggling every day to figure out this crazy thing called life. We'll never figure that out completely, but what we will do is continue making masterpieces of film like this one to cope with how it's going. I'm going to rewatch this one a handful of hot dog fingered times.

30 March 2023,Very overrated movie,"How this movie ended up with winning 7 Oscars is beyond me... I guess the movie makers wanted it to be funny, dramatic, sad and thrilling, but it ended up with nothing at all. It was a bit awkward to watch, and I cringed a few times simple because I felt sorry for the actors to be in these stupid scenes.

A much overrated movie that I will never watch again. I did not even watch the whole movie in one go because it sucked. However, I just had to watch the rest of the movie the next day, just to see what the hype was all about. Yupp, Still sucked.

I gave it 3 stars for the originality and a couple of semi funny moments.

2 June 2022,I don't normally review movies,"But I had to say something about this one. I feel like I've watched something special. I just left the cinema 2 hours ago, and it hasn't really set in yet. But I feel like this has the potential to become a true classic of the modern times. It's the sort of movie, that I can't imagine anyone not at least finding some sort of resonance with. The message it contains is universal and the way it delivers it is truly original and even somewhat unique. It operates under the modus of ""more is more"" and that might be the only reason that I wouldn't give this movie a 10 out of 10.

At the same time, if it wasn't for the willingness of the writers to explore every possible idea they (and their team I presume...) could come up with, the movie wouldn't be what it is - and in some weird way I wouldn't want it to be perfect anyway - the overwhelmed feeling that I'm left with now, is part of what makes the movie such a masterpiece. And, maybe one day, when I've rewatched this a handful of times, I'll come back and bump my review up to a ten.",9
3 April 2023,More A Work Of Art Than A Movie,"The first time I saw this masterpiece, I was cross and upset. I wanted to ENJOY it - but I tried too hard to UNDERSTAND it.

I was left wanting to feel more. You can't go in to it with any specific expectations in your mind as it is truly an unrelenting stream of thought and ideas that don't really seem fit for existence.

The whole piece feels like a joke - but one that was excellently carried out.

The second time I experienced it, a whole new story arose. I relaxed and let myself feel the art. I don't believe there is a better thing out there.

I would 100% recommend to anybody who wants to discover a completely different genre of film.",10

28 September 2023,"Spectacular, Magical, Unique","I have never felt anything like this in a cinema. It started off slow and I had a hard time getting the hang of it, but the last hour is so good... I went to see it with friends and we usually comment on some things during the movie, but this time we were quiet, without moving, absorbed in the screen trying to assimilate what we were seeing and enjoying every second.

It may not be for everyone, it certainly is nothing like the rest of the films that usually come out in theaters. But in this era of reboots and remakes, original ideas like this are always welcome. I hope to feel something like that again in future films, I need it.

100% recommended.

28 October 2022,I love this movie,"This movie was so refreshing and original, I could probably watch it 3 more times and pick up on things I missed the first couple times. I laughed, cried, couldn't take my eyes off the screen and was never sure what might happen next. Most movies are predictable and boring following the same formula and ending predictably. Watch this movie if you love originality and have a taste for the strange and unusual. I wish there were more writers and directors thinking outside the box and taking risks like this. The acting is great, story is great, the cinematography is great, EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE IS GREAT IN THIS FILM.

20 May 2022,More Madness than the Multiverse of Madness!,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

7 August 2023,Collective Consciousness,"This film is extraordinary in every way. The creativity of the Daniels in this storytelling of the multiverse. It blows my mind. I felt the whole spectrum of emotions from this film. The family dynamic, asian culture dynamic, sexuality, and the action? Yas.

I feel very connected to the universe when I watch things that highlight such human experiences. The what ifs, the butterfly effect, timeline jumping. I've always been a Michelle Yeoh fan and grew up watching her films. Her performance was absolutely outstanding. The entire ensemble were captivating in their characters. Just a beautiful work of art.

Time went by so fast whilst watching this i was shocked when it was over cause it felt like 20 minutes. This movie is definitely meant to be seen on the big screen so i definitely recommend you watch it in the movie theater. The acting was also top notch i especially enjoyed Michelle Yeoh's performance. I think this movie deserved all the awards it got. I don't get why people are saying this is overrated but people think it's cool to hate popular things nowadays so i'm not surprised.... anyway great movie, please watch.

23 May 2022,Didn't get it.,"I watch and enjoy enough deep or artistic movies. Hell, I studied film and media for years so I've been exposed to the strangest things ever produced.

I decided to watch this based purely on the amount of positive reviews it was getting but I just don't get it. You know those paintings that people say are masterpieces and then you see it and it looks like something a child made? This is how I feel about this movie. Seems like it's just weird for the sake of being weird and it's getting a lot of extra credit for being quite unique. The comedy was either crude or childish so that didn't do much for me either.

I'll give a middle rating purely because you've probably never seen anything like this before. Loads of people love it so you might too. Either way, you're going to experience something different for a change.

15 July 2022,Absolutely loved it!!!,"""Every rejection, every disappointment has led you here to this moment.""

There comes a time in life you think about the Shoudda,Coudda, Woulddas... But what if we can be content with the life we have? The thoughts of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way... But what if you see that the flipside to life being meaningless is in fact the freedom that comes from the fact that you can do anything and that you did your best with the time you've got???

This film is a crazy ride... I laughed, I screamed WTF several times, I cried; oh boy I cried... I absolutely loved it...

By the end I saw my nervous anxiety ridden self with all my quirks and strengths and understood that all decisions good and bad I've made in life have brought me here and its exactly where I need to be.",10

6 May 2023,Nothing Nowhere Oh Good God,"In an age where it is apparently impossible to make a movie that is not a sequel, a superhero franchise, a continuation of a trilogy, a continuation of a Furious/Mission P 16 part series, or of course a complete remake that sets up any of these other candidates; here comes something different right?? Yeah! Wrong again!! Let's take an original story and combine it with all the quick cut CGI crap all the previous mentioned do and sell it as artistic genius. Annoying to watch, but let's give it a Best Picture. The deluded Academy that gives this award is embarrassing. I can only hope they're selling themselves out for a shot to work on next year's Best Crap Picture. I liked Jaime Lee though. After multiple Halloweening, she at least thru in an acting twist.

Where science and philosophy let your mind wander in and beyond the 'What If's.....

Yes, its not a new concept, but it was just mental, and so much fun to watch (and feel).

I'm so glad I went to watch this without reading in to it. Was like watching inter-dimensional cable, with a dash of Matrix and sprinkle of His Dark Materials.

Laughed a load out load, but also truly heartwarming and enlightening. Those who rated this movie low just don't get it or the deeper meaning.

14 September 2022,"I still didn't really know what that movie was but I'm sure of one thing, it was amazing","I went to see this movie because a friend of mine told me it looked fun. Before I went to the cinema, I knew nothing about the film, neither the genre nor the directors. When the movie ended, I still didn't really know what it was but I was sure of one thing, it was amazing. The more I think about it, the more I realize that this film has no real flaw. The action scenes are very beautiful and we feel all the love of the directors for the films of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. The editing is very fluid and pleasant. The film is well rhythmic, you never get bored. The writing is as touching as it is funny. This film is really impressive, it surprises us every second. You never really know what you're watching, you alternate between sf and family drama. This film is really a new breath in the current film industry, an author's blockbuster that never suffers from its low budget and that could become for the next generation of filmmakers a revolutionary film as was the first Matrix (whose film is a bit inspired ) by its positivity, its universal message, and its cinematic qualities.",10

22 May 2022,Incredibly Emotional and Life-Affirming,"This movie blends concepts and certain stylistic elements from The Matrix (though it is tonally and thematically very different) with the kind of absurd humor you'd find in something like Kung Fury (though without quite as much self-aware tropeyness). This movie genuinely surprised me; I don't typically think of comedies as great media, especially not comedic movies, but this movie is so emotionally resonant while also being funny that I cannot but give it a 10. To be clear, this movie is not perfect. It's not particularly deep, intellectual or cerebral. Though its first part, Everything, is funny, the movie takes its time getting to its absolute highest. The comedy doesn't always hit, particularly some of the sexual humor or scenes where the protagonist pees herself or inhales a fly. It's not particularly hard to find a few holes in the movie's logic. To my mind, however, none of that detracts from how great this movie is. This movie is raw emotion, and if you've experienced the emotions it puts on display, I think you can get something out of it. Its representation of an American immigrant family might get nods or smiles from those who come from such a background, and its almost psychedelic representation of what it's like to feel overwhelmed by life can speak powerfully to those who've felt that way. Combine that with comedy that, to me at least, hits far harder than it misses and even plays into the more poignant aspects of the story, genuinely good action, and beautiful, surreal visuals, and you get, without exaggeration, the best movie I've ever seen. This movie looks at life in all its insanity, suffering, tedium, and regrets and says yes. And that, I think, is something a lot of people can get value out of.",10
25 June 2022,One of the best comedy and thriller/action movie of recent times,"The concept of this movie is pretty interesting, the cinematography, transitions and acting is great and the line delivery by actors is just amazing. The movie takes a very nice turn from mystery and action to focus on the life issues of the charactors and improve their relationship.

It's difficult to know where to begin with this film, but my general opinion is that it's brilliant and delivers precisely what it promises and intends to. It articulates its messages directly in an immersive manner that is relatable to to all (though yeah, not suitable for young children).

20 March 2023,When you try so hard to be original,"My experience was going from ""what's going on"" and the occasional giggle, to ""ok that's a cool idea"" to i can't stand this anymore.

It's an unnecessarily overly complex movie to convey a very simple idea. I get the appeal of the stylistic choices and the creativity involved, but it's not my cup of tea. It looks good and promising on the first 30 minutes, but after that it's actually more and more painful to watch and not funny anymore.

Speaking about the creativity, i never thought I'd say this ever, but it's too much. Just too silly, too ridiculous and off putting. Like the people behind it did everything they could to do something they deem ""original"", very forcefully, in a very unnatural way.

In a way, it kind of reminds me of Tenet by Christopher Nolan, which was much better than this one, but still has that extra degree of complexity just for the sake of trying to be original. It doesn't work in that film either. A good example where this was done flawlessly is The Matrix.

I'd say this movie is the representation of the exact theme the movie tries to present a solution to, Nihilism. The world is so devoid of values, people are so confused, original work and ideas are thrown out the window in Hollywood in favour of money-making dumbed down movies, they don't know what else to make to be original, the desperation is very clear when they awarded this the Oscar for best picture.

I will never forget this movie, but will try to, and will never revisit it again. Not worth the watch not even to satisfy curiosity. Skip it entirely.",4
19 May 2022,Insanely inventive,"The less you know going into this movie, the better. Full stop. Do not read reviews. Do not let people tell you about it. Just go and see it with an open mind. It will start with you wondering whether you're watching a family drama, but buckle in. You're in for a ride. It's clever, emotional, hysterical, thoughtful and you walk out elated and happy you saw the movie. It's deep, if you want it to be, and fun regardless. Ambitious as heck, it successful pulls off its ambitions and joins my top ten list movies that i have enjoyed of all time, and i have conservatively seen 5000 movies. And if you don't like it? Too much for you? Well, at least you saw it and now have an opinion.

4 August 2023,A Horrible Waste of Time,"Months ago, I fell asleep during ""Everything, Everywhere All At Once,"" finding it horrible, but after it won so many awards, including the Best Picture Oscar and three acting awards, plus writing and direction, I thought that perhaps I was too tired originally and decided this evening to give it another chance.

I fell asleep twice, rewound the DVD to where I'd conked out and essentially forced myself to sit through one of the worst, if not pointless, movies I have ever seen in my life.

Visually, it's intriguing, though it gets to a point where the countless and tiresome cuts all over the place become increasingly dreary. It's like the filmmakers had visual computer film toys which, due to their expense, they were insistent upon using

I cannot understand its presumed esteem and perhaps what I might have missed, though I cannot believe there are not many others who feel likewise. What a waste of over two hours of my life!",1
20 May 2022,A real surprise,"Emotionally packed movie carrying more than one message, from mastering an existential crisis over realising which people matter most in your life, to being more open and/or tolerant to a different sexual orientation. But most of all, nothing really matters . . .

23 May 2022,Evelyn & Sisyphus,"As a film entirely devoted to Albert Camus, it impressed me a lot. It seems to have been the philosophical reflection of the books 'The Stranger' and 'The Myth of Sisyphus'. If you are interested in the philosophy of existentialism, it will make you think a lot. The main theme is based on the problematic of whether life is worth living or not. Of course, since this is a very heavy and depressing subject, they decorated the movie with absurdly funny scenes and good enough fight scenes. If they had not done this, they would have dragged the audience into that 'Black Hole'. In short, the score in your head is constantly changing from 1 to 10 in every minute of this two-hour movie, until you end up feeling bored and sometimes stunned. The acting, visual effects, music are very good, I can say that it is the unexpected movie of the year.

Albert Camus' book 'The Myth of Sisyphus' begins with this sentence; ""There is only one philosophical problem that really matters, suicide. To judge whether life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question of philosophy."" Here is the 'Jobu Tupaki' character, after all the endless lives she has experienced in the parallel universe; She decides that the truth, the meaning of life, is nothing. She also wants to share this nothingness with her mother 'Evelyn Wang'. Her mother's experience of all these other lifetimes by following her daughter and eventually turning into stone and then rolling off the mountainside turns into a life's unchanging cycle of hope and frustration. The punishment given to Sisyphus by the gods, the burden he will carry forever, is just that. In the end, Evelyn decides that instead of getting rid of this burden placed on everyone, she should accept it and just be 'kind' in life. This is how she fights her daughter's thoughts. Your goals, your desires, everything we do may be empty and meaningless, nowhere to be found. What matters is the path itself and with whom you share it. Therefore, Sisyphus and Evelyn can find happiness in every collapse and disappointment, and such happy people spread happiness around them.",10
16 January 2023,A Poignant Portrail of an Inperfect family,"Love can be fought for, spoken, shown in gesture, or action.

One of the first things that came across onscreen was the love language of each character and how they operated within their world. People can be flawed and hateful, but still care for the ones they cherish. The world can come crashing down an yet you can look to that one person to hope and shield.

This was evident and why i was in tears for nearly the whole movie. The ""Daniels"" were able to weave a thoughtful sentiment into a chaotic world bending narrative that came alive for each and every viewer. If there was a movie going experience that truly showed the capability to impact, This was it.

""Of all the places i could be, I just want to be here with you.""

31 March 2023,Topic and LGBTQ+,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

27 May 2022,The most touching movie for me since the Matrix.,"There are so many excellent movies, depending on one's taste, it is hard to say which one is better than one another. But among the best movies, there are ones that inspire a whole genre and a generation.

For me, the matrix is that kind of movie. Within which there is a fascinating, realistic world with its unique physics laws, culture, hierarchy, and characters. And the creators are at their premiere era of creation, and ideas are so overflowing that they try hard to push them into their works like cramping a feast into a tightening tin can. And when you open it, it just blows everything right in your face. Compared to Avatar, another one of my favorites, Avatar is the feast, much more mature, presented to you in a Michelin dining room, and you're well-acquainted that it must be dame good before tasting, without some specific feeling of surprise.

I don't need to comment on the details or philosophy of the movie. There are tons of them. Instead, I want to express that you have to watch it and break your mind. It should be a movie you need to watch in your lifetime. PS, any rating less than 8/10 is not fair.",9
21 April 2022,Currently questioning my existence,"Some of the best visuals I've ever seen. Acting was pretty phenomenal as well. I think this is a movie everyone should see.

Every action I take leads to a different possibility, this review I'm writing is creating an entirely different present to if I were to do something else. Just a thought that this film provoked for me.

I think it'll stick with me for a long while, ya know life really aint that deep, everyone else is living their own different reality right at this moment, all that shi.

21 May 2022,"Unwatchable, hyperactive nonsense...","...and the usual over-exaggerated ratings that paint it as a work of genius!

I like honest reviews, they're helpful in deciding what to watch.

The problem with dishonest reviews is they make people more cautious about watching new things and - in the end - producers & the industry itself will be less inclined to fund potential new things.

That being said:

This was not very entertaining, it was quite annoying.

The slow, unnecessarily long scenes that tried to put an artsy edge to the movie just came across as tedious and over-cooked.

If the first 30 minutes don't give the viewer some interest or curiosity about watching the rest then you've failed as a big budget film maker.

I give it a 4 for effort, but my true feeling is probably negative 4 just because of the hype and lies surrounding it.",4
13 November 2022,Watch this movie immediately,"This is single handedly the best movie I've ever watched. If you want to experience every possible emotion all while being absorbed in amazing visuals and incredible acting performances then this is the movie for you. I have thought about it everyday since watching it and have recommended/required everyone I know to watch it:). The movie encompasses multiple significant and relavent topics while still finding space for humour and action. If there were ever a movie I wished I could see for the first time again it would be this one. Everything, Everywhere, All at Once is incomparable to any other film.

27 September 2022,"A beautiful, wonderful, and meaningul chaos","If you are tired of films speaking about the importance of love, kindness and family, go watch this film, it's all about that. But better.

This film is the perfect balance between action, sci-fi, auteur and so many other genres. You never expect what is coming next. You sometimes laugh or cry, and you often do both.

I still cannot describe how this film made me feel, and how (almost) perfect it is. Not one second did I get bored. And the most surprising for a 2022 movie for me : I can't stop thinking about it.

The editing, the lights, the acting, the camera movements, the music, the sound, and so many more things are simply beautifully mixed together in wonderful, meaningful chaos.

I could talk about this film in more details, and for way too long, but I'll stop here and tell you something everybody must have told you : go watch it, immediately.",10
19 July 2022,An excellent ride throughout. Just go ahead & watch!,"The film starts so simple & gets to open up in many layers after the first 15 minutes. It starts your ride with the concept of multiverse which is Sci-Fi later turn into action & ends on an emotional note.

The film is a complete package of ""everything"" spread out ""everywhere"" ""all at once"" in a single film. I felt I had watched something so good at the end of the film. The performances of the leads, especially Michelle Yeoh as 'Evelyn', Stephanie Hsu as 'Joy' & Kay Huy Quan as 'Waymond' were extraordinary! Kay Huy's variations in his performance totally grabbed my eyes onto him. It was a delight watching his performance.

No words to say about the technical department. Just hands down for the output.

30 January 2023,Interesting but complex movie,"Not since Inside John Malkovich has a movie had so many threads that come together by the end of the movie. The movie had so many transitions and with each transition a new story involves the main characters. But yet by the end of the movie, all of these transitions come together and proclaim a simple lesson about family and acceptance of one another. Excellent acting and definitely one of the best movies of 2022.

Definitely a contender for Best Picture. A definite reminder of Terry Gilliam's Brazil and a very creative experience of movie making. Do not try to analyze it just sit back and enjoy the creative experience.

18 July 2022,"Beautiful written, touching and hilarious","I went into this movie not expecting more than a small little movie that i will watch once and forget about in a day, i can confidently say that i was hugely mistaken this movie was so captivating that its 2 hour 19 minute run-time felt like only 30 minutes. It is beautiful in so many ways to avoid spoilers one of the characters constant outfit changes was so creative, Michelle Yeoh is fantastic as the protagonist, ke huy quan was perfect at changing his voice and mannerisms to match his personality, oh and his moment at the end really was so well done and touching. This movie was also hilarious (Jamie Lee Curtis adds a lot of humor) i loved the comedy style and its wacky shenanigans ( For context i am 12 ). So overall i think this movie easily gets a 9 out of 10, any doubts you have about this movie should be cleared go watch it now.

16 July 2023,Quantum Entanglement simplified,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a visually captivating and intellectually stimulating film. The film's nonlinear storytelling may prove challenging for some viewers, as it constantly shifts between different timelines and realities. However, this approach adds depth and intrigue to the narrative, allowing audiences to piece together the puzzle and contemplate the underlying themes. Its complex narrative and abstract concepts require an open mind and a willingness to embrace ambiguity. Some viewers might find the film's philosophical and metaphysical elements overwhelming or hard to grasp. With its stellar performances from Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis and with thought-provoking themes, this film offers a cinematic experience that challenges our understanding of reality and the interconnectedness of the universe. Michelle Yeoh is outstanding and truly deserves the academy award for best actress. A path breaking effort from writer-directors duo Daniel Kwan& Daniel Scheinert to offer a scientific theme to a captivating metaphor of interconnectedness, destiny, and the infinite possibilities that exist in the fabric of reality. The movie is a daring exploration of quantum entanglement that pushes the boundaries of traditional storytelling.",8

9 September 2022,This movie is life,"Perhaps this movie beats all my favorites like the Matrix or Limitless.

The movie is about every stage of life and how to deal with it. It goes deep into human nature and figures out that ultimately, there is no ""trick"" to enlightenment, but it's all the things in your life being in tune with each other.

The whole idea of this movie essentially is to create a vibe that comes as close as possible to sense perception and the potentially extreme chaos implied by that. Life is absolutely chaotic, it is extremely hard to solve if we get engaged with the logic of our environment. The environment can potentially be hell and the mind will run away from it. Evelyn is the personification of exactly that, she runs away from the immanent facts that actually rule her life and she gets very upset whenever anyone tries to show her the vastness of reality. Having done LSD, this reminded me of certain stages during the life altering experience during the trip. It's a memory that returns periodically.

Obviously the movie can have any effect on anyone, it's like drugs. Whatever you want from the drug you can achieve, if it's just fun or wisdom. There can never be consensus of things like this, it's like life itself.",10

18 April 2022,I have a better title for the film...,"""Everything you need to know about Gen Z, all at once"".

They took Will Ferrell's ""random"" style of comedy and made Cloud Atlas with it, then flogged it to death.

It's a movie for cat owners. Random random random, blah blah blah, us and our cats are so impish and whimsical!

Nowadays, it's as though filmmakers are trying to fit an entire season of a TV show into a movie, but only showing the highlights. It's too much, everywhere, all at once.

6 June 2023,A chaotic but still coherent journey,"I had not heard of this film nor seen a trailer and while browsing the new released films on TV, I found the title and the cover extremely appealing. So I just blindly started the movie.

And oh boy, I was in for a treat.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is an original, funny, but also moving film with an impactful message. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie so brilliant with such amazing concepts and ideas. Everything Everywhere All At Once is a chaotic but still coherent journey. It's a metaverse that tells the essence of human relationships through many different film genres, connected in unique and spectacular ways.

Every formal aspect, from the direction to the editing to the fight choreography, is meticulously executed as well as functional in holding together and developing neatly a complex plot.

I also cannot stress enough how much the duality of a simple phrase like ""Nothing matters"" touched me personally.

I highly recommend it.",10
6 September 2023,Blown Away,"Just a completely unique movie experience I'll be thinking about for years to come.

I was constantly impressed by the costuming and makeup; every outfit Jobu Tupaki put together had SO much detail and care. The score was powerful, and did a great job of adding to the film without overpowering it. I loved to see this core story of a mother and daughter at the center of an epic sci-fi with such well-done world building. Plus the sense of humor scattered throughout heavy moments was consistently unexpected and delightful. Overall, a film entirely worth watching.

30 March 2023,"I love this movie, and the lesson it teaches.","Everything Everywhere All at Once.... What can I say?

This movie is an amazing movie, it goes deep into topics such as Existential Crisis, Depression, and about life in general. I am a teenager who has yet to experience a life of my own, cooped up in my parents home.

However, this movie pertained to me because I feel like it represents me, the characters feel are relatable, parents who fear for the next generation, others who just reject it entirely. Teenagers who are scared, and dealing with mental issues.

This movie despite the craziness and sci-fi, feels...real...it feels like life......

4 February 2023,So bad and overrated I made an IMDB account to write a review,"I was talking to a friend a few days ago, who is passionate about quantic physics, that it's about time some movie will come up with Hugh Everett's many world's interpretation of quantum mechanics. Sadly, this crap got to it in a main stream way first. It's hugely overrated and can't remember having to watch a movie with such a big discrepancy vs imdb score. Maybe the idea seems revolutionary to some, and that's why it got the big acclaims. But no matter how you look at it, it's a huge waste of time. I will definitely remember this movie for being the worst I've seen in a very long time. Don't skip science class, when you see crap you'll be less impressed.

13 November 2022,A Rollercoaster of Emotions Inside Us All,"This film will not be for everyone.

Every now and then, we get an absolutely golden film with deeper messages and themes that resonate with moments in our lives

There are a lot of low score reviews, who could only process the action in front of them. The action and goofyness is only the cosmetics in front of you. A pillow for what would actually be quite serious and heavy without.

The deeper messages appear to you from each character. And if you have been through some of these hardships/challenges, you start to follow where this film is going.

Everyone cast are absolutely perfect in their roles. And the ending is a truly feel good one. The occurrence in each multiverse are both impressive and hilarious.

If you enjoyed films like The Joker, Parasite, District 9 or Cloud Atlas, this is very much in your ball park.

Never had a film make me cry, but there is a moment (also quoted in the Quotes section) that made me think of my life with my wife and it was tears of love and joy.

Life may not be perfect, but if we each try to make it better, we will succeed :)",10
17 April 2022,Incredible experience,"To begin, it must be known that prior to watching this film I got blown. I went into this experience with basically no knowledge about what I was about to watch. The first 10 minutes were a little slow and confusing, but once the ball got rolling, things got wild.

The sheer number of details in this movie will leave me coming back to discover new things about it every time I watch it. I mean it when I tell you that I never expected the next thing to happen. EEAAO constantly made me think the plot would go one direction but then everything would hit a 180 and I'd be watching hotdog-finger porn. The costume designs, the acting, the lighting, (almost) everything about this movie was phenomenal. This movie, which I thought was purely sci-fi before watching, made me crack up, almost cry, and left my jaw on the floor. EEAAO was everything I could have ever wanted in a movie and more. A true work of art, and a must-watch for stoners.

Only department it lacks is philosophy and bigger things that joy was seeing/feeling it should have been more developed.

27 March 2023,The Movie That Forced Me To Review It,"I do not write reviews. I do not go out of my way to write good or bad reviews. I simply can't be bothered.

However, this movie is so incredible that it would feel wrong not to do so. It is one of a kind and something that will be studied in filmography in some years.

Having watched it 4 times, it only gets better and better. Each time you watch there is something new to enjoy. I don't think I have ever watched a film that so perfectly puts together everything it is trying to do and I don't think there will ever be a film that can manage what this one did.

It is truly an incredible journey.

27 December 2022,Groundbreaking and unequivocally fresh,"This film is a completely new experience and it was absolutely mildblowing to watch in theatres. Handling very serious topics and gut wrenching scenes in a comedic way, while still supplying intense action and brillant fight choreography. It is so nice to see a film these days that isn't a remake or a sequel in a franchise, Michelle Yeoh does beautiful job showing the realness of her character and the conflict. Jamie Lee Curtis is also a gem for this project, mixing it up opposite Yeoh. Stephanie Hsu might be my favorite part of this movie, her dedication to her character is remarkable. I highly recommend this film and I cannot wait to see how it does at the oscar's.

25 May 2022,Perfect üëå,"I felt like the movie was talking to me.

The metaphors.

The different universes.

The symbolisms.

This is brilliant, I've not seen a movie that made me think this deep in a long while.

You just have sit back after the movie and relive the movie in real time.

It's serious and it's also funny.

This movie is something alot of people haven't been able to explain, in years.

Love Life Pain Emptiness Family

Phew.

The casting was great.

The storyline was superb.

EVERY SCENE HAD A DEEP MEANING (no jokes)

You just have to open your mind to see it.

I see reviews about the movie being overhyped and I just feel it's probably because

1, they don't understand it

2, they couldn't relate

Life itself is chaotic.

I love this movie so much!

All the way from Nigeria.",10
8 January 2023,"I want to love this, but I'm left confused","I really really wanted to love this movie. It is a spectacle, visually interesting and it has a nice ending, but for a majority of the time I was just so confused with what was happening. All the multiverses, the weird jumps in time, the plot that escalated quickly and weirdly. The first 45 minutes I was waiting for something to make more sense or for the movie to pick up some speed. I don't know, I honestly feel a bit sad because my partner really loved the movie and was touched by it!

Maybe I have to watch it another time to grasp the magnificent feeling it gave many people. The ending was nice though.

14 October 2022,Beautiful Movie Ever!,"The story good like the spider verse movie. Movie is so brilliant I just love sci fyi movies! Just love the different universes they'd show and that it is telling us that the choices we make and the life we make impact our world and make a parallel world. I would highly recommend this movie to my friends and family. If you haven't seen it that you are living under a rock. I think they should make 2nd one or a prequel to it, I would see that! Or they should make a tv show of it. Best movie ever. Beautiful color and animation was spot on and the effects looks good and none you see nowadays or in other movies.

22 April 2022,Don't read further unless you choose the red pill! Or you're a parent. Or you're obsessed with bagels and black holes.,"This movie was extraordinarily creative, with caveats.

The trailers are absolute eye candy. They include Matrix-like action scenes with high contrast and slow motion martial arts. There are mentions of the multiverse, and one headline online suggested the film was an intro into quantum mechanics and alternate dimensions. The hype is so intense for this production that I tossed my conventional thriftiness out the window to wait until the next discount day at the local theater. Instead I pre-ordered an expensive ticket for the best seat at a luxury cinema that has huge reclining leather seats with lots of leg room. I was ready to shortcut years of college physics classes for the two and a half hour long visual treat.

As the movie began I skipped attention at the early scenes while organizing boxes of candy and drinks. When the tax office scene started I knew from the trailers it's time to focus. As the movie progressed it was delightful, a comedic parody merging The Matrix with The Lego Movie. So far so good. Unlike the Matrix, it's actually hilariously funny and the production team here invested in lighting so you actually can see what's going on during the movie.

(Opinion ahead!)

Yet, midway through the film, all of sudden realized I had been shamboozled, as scenes with the hidden meaning started illuminating through the smoke and mirrors of the parody.

There's two main perspectives on where you're coming from when you watch this movie. If you're a parent of a teenager or young adult, then long story short, this film is a colorful fun metaphor for why you should always make kindness and unconditional love the number one important theme for your communication with your kid, even through the rough times. Honestly from this view it is a brilliantly wonderful modern parenting guide presented on the big screen.

If you're a parent, once you get to this realization in the movie, turn on your phone, and send a text to your kid, ""Hi, how are you doing, wish you were here, it's a great movie, just reminding you that I love you."" Then continue watching the movie, occasionally laughing aloud, which you will many times, and saying to yourself, ""Hahaha oh yeah I can relate to that conversation... and that one... and that one too"". The dramatic interaction scenes are spot on indeed.

(Alternate perspective for the rest of you)

However, if you don't have kids then just pretend this movie is an updated Matrix, but with lots of humor and comedy and with better lighting. Just like in The Lego Movie, we are presented a story line in which a 'nobody' can be special and save the world, or in this case all the infinite possible universes too.

The Everywhere movie has a tasty recipe. Combine the somber serious overtone of The Matrix with the happier smiling vibe of The Lego Movie. Now give the chef some magic mushrooms to snack on while heating up the sauce and sprinkle some of those peyote stems in the pot and go really wild with the absurdity. For atmosphere stir in the maximum amount of layers possible. Toss in every seasoning and spice in the kitchen and let them sort out their taste buds in between chomping on popcorn.

Forget using antique pay phone booths to travel! Although sniffing the Kragle might do something. Snort a bug up your nose, sit on a trophy, or chew some of that sticky gum on the bottom of your shoe. The more insane the action, the better the slingshot connecting to a wackier dimension. The visuals are so mind opening that you don't have to drive to New Jersey and get high before watching this film.

(Skipping lots of specific scenes because you'll have to see for yourself, including the rubber...)

Just know that when the movie ends you'll have the thought that there could be billions or trillions of versions of you, and that you could very well be living in the worst possible scenario of all of them. It's likely that every choice and decision you have ever made were the wrong ones. But take comfort in that although your life might suck, there's potentially trillions of happier versions of you and many are rich superstars. Yes you might be a failure and a nobody, but in the event of an actual multiverse emergency you might be the first one they call.

Don't forget the movie's sub-sub note here. If you're with a partner, guess what, just like you they are probably the worst version of themselves too. However, since you may have just watched the movie with them, right now they might be thinking the same about you. So now's a great time to give each other a hug and kiss.

(What's the real reveal?)

Saving the best topic for last, who's the villain in this movie? Pay attention, because it's the only way to save the multiverse. No it's not a computer machine monster army, nor even the holder of the Kragle. It's you. Yes really it's you. Well, it's simultaneously you and most everyone else in the multiverse. So you're not alone. For the villain role Everywhere, Everything All at Once deals the most realistic aspect of the movie and of life, the typical overall lack of human kindness. In addition to making bad choices you likely have a lack of appreciation, a lack of empathy, a lack of acceptance, a lack of openness, a lack of love, a lack of communication, etc.

However the solution to fixing everything that is wrong in the multiverse is actually super easy, barely an inconvenience. No it's not EMP's, nor virus codes, nor armies. The answer is kindness and love. It's here where I give the movie the highest review possible, for the truth of this simplicity should be in every movie, every play, every book, every story, every spoken dialogue, every action, every thought. Just like it is in real life, the answer to fixing everything, everywhere all at once is kindness and love.

See, you gotta love a movie with a happy ending.

After you leave the cinema, you might be tempted to go get a bagel with everything on it. Skip it. Go get a cookie instead. When you're there at the counter buy a few cookies for those around you and tell the person behind the counter thank you and smile, and leave a tip. While you're nibbling away, send texts to everyone you know saying ""Thanks for being you, you're amazing.""

By the time you finish and walk outside, you'll feel right as rain again.",10
24 July 2022,Perfect in nearly every way,"This movie is wonderful in every aspect of the word. A heartfelt tribute to life and existence in a time where everything seems surrounded by darkness. When you look up at the stars and believe that nothing matters or everything is pointless, this film reminds you to find everything in life to love.

Michelle Yeoh's performance is Oscar worthy, Stephanie Hsu as Joy has one of the most relatable and captivating performances in any movie, the editing of this film is some of the best I've ever seen, and the script is absolutely heart wrenching. If this movie doesn't sweep at the Oscars I will be very genuinely surprised.

100/10 would recommend.

3 May 2022,EMOTIONAL DAMAGE,"This movie exceeded all of my expectations, from laughing, to crying, to bawling, to laughing; the range of emotions this film made me feel. The performances top notch, Michelle, Ke Huy, Jamie Lee, and James absolutely killed it, but the stand out for me was Stephanie Hsu. All of the characters that she played and her emotion to each different one I felt it. Her and Michelle's chemistry is unbreakable and watching the two play off of each other was brilliant. I will not stop raving about this movie. Dan Kwan I am looking forward to many more movies from you.

But unfortunately im not anyone of those and i think the majority isn't either. Thus the goofy scenes and cliche plot didn't worked for me . 4/10.

20 April 2022,Ref:help,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

7 August 2023,What it is to be HUMAN.,"All I can stay is that, at the end of this move, I said, ""I can't believe this movie made me cry."" Totally unexpected. A unique and creative way to send an emotional message about human fragility, ignorance, fear, all the things about what it is to be human. Be emotionally prepared, expect a lot of strange and unexpected humor. Watch with an open mind.

This movie is visually creative in many scenes as well as bizarre and extreme. The performances are amazing. The story is heartfelt despite in all its weirdness.

An emotional roller coaster half way through this movie. Laughter, disgust, appalled, sensitive, anxiety. A movie to touch you like this as weird as it was....deserves an Academy Award.

10 April 2023,The craziest movie ever (in a good way),"I watched this movie with my family, and I have to say that it is one of my favorite movies of all time. The story, the visual effects, and the message about acceptance are all impeccable and deserved to win as many Oscars as it did.

The actors in this movie all did a great job and we're all amazing at delivering their character and how they all seemed like they were a family. Evelyn was a great main character, and how she interacted with the different worlds with such imagination.

Overall this movie is one I've the greatest I have ever seen and it definitely deserves a watch and a good rating from anyone who watches it!

31 March 2023,It's all about enlightenment,"For a movie I didn't catch that much enjoyment, the acting part was a messed up, the scenes were like too childish, and I also found creative the multi scenes part, but sometimes it gets too messy; but for the message it passes through, they gave us that mystery about the multiverse, the how all the stuffs in the world collapses and turns around to this simple reality we living and the bunch of realities and possibilities within it, so I guess the message shows us how messed up is our life and the movie were just a representation of that messed up, that's why it has too many scenes out of sense, cause life is out of sense, and they tried and in my point of view very successfully, to represent all that thing and bring up a solution about how we can get out of that ""mess"".

27 July 2022,Best Movie I've seen in years.,"I have my favourite movies obviously. There are movies that I will go back and watch again and again regardless of them being technically good or not. Sometimes movies just resonate with you because of nostelgia, or because they're relatable, or because they play with your imagination and emotions. I'm approaching middle age now so that kind of thing doesn't really happen to me anymore. I'll enjoy a movie sure, but I won't be blown away by many. Everything Everywhere All at Once is the exception to this rule. Everything Everywhere All at Once is an exceptional movie and one that I have not enjoyed this much in probably a decade or more. It might be my favorite film now. A second watch may confirm or deny this but it's easily the best movie of 2022. It's a perfect film. Perfectly shot, perfectly paced, perfectly timed. Even if you ignore the profound story linez, the hilarious jokes, the intense sci-fi action and the emotional drama, it is a film that could not have been made better. I don't know if this is a one off fluke or if these dorectiors are actually geniuses. Only time will tell.

To all the haters, I'm just going to have to assume they have a completely different idea of what makes a good movie and that we would never actually agree with eachother about anything. These people should probably be ousted from society to be perfectly honest.

I pray that other directors take note of this charmingly dazzling film. Thank the Lord for A24. GO AND WATCH IT RIGHT NOW.",10
20 March 2023,Bewildering nonsense,"Bizarre, chaotic, directionless nonsense. I saw Jamie Lee Curtis on TV say she didn't understand the story when she took the role but now believes it's about love. I think it's about the director trying to create as many meaningless, violent and unfathomable scenes as possible within the budget available.

I confess I only managed to watch half the movie up to the point when I was cringing at what was purporting to happen to a guy with no pants on. Nothing in this scene was progressing the story. It was just the production staff trying to see how gross they could make the scene and still get the movie shown in mainstream cinema.

Just an horrendous movie.

14 May 2023,Wow,"I really really don't ever do reviews for anything. But this movie has me wanting to encourage the world to give it a try. I almost instantly fell in love. I threw it on after all the hype with the Oscar winning and what not. I'm no movie critic. I'm not one to make a point of watching Oscar nominated, or winning films. I put it on for background but very soon after it had my full attention. I was asked to describe what it was about and I said everything. The title speaks for itself. I cried for the last 30mins. Ugly cried. Like I said I'm no critic, maybe others think this movie sucked or didn't get it. Maybe I'm being biased with the Asian family narrative hitting too close to home. But I thought it was lovely and beautiful and epic. I cant stop thinking about it since it ended. Ready for a rewatch already. I think I could write an essay about it so I'll wrap it up here but moral of the story, this movie has become an immediate new favorite and I will sing its praises until the end of time. Check it out.

29 August 2022,Transcendental Multiverse,"First 20 minutes of the movie may be a hard nut to crack but give it a chance and try to look at it from a distance. Try to open your mind and look for a deeper sense. Don't focus on the picture itself but on what the director is trying to convey through it.

If you are interested in multiverse/quantum physics topics you will be delighted. I have never seen so well depicted interpretation of a multiverse concept. It will take you far beyond the limits of your perception. Will not only show you the 'out the box' thinking - it will totally destroy all the walls of that box, showing you all the possible ways the atoms your body consists of could ever turn into. All other concepts of the multiverse like the one in the Marvel's Universe are somehow limited - they present other worlds but with the same structure - there are humanoid creatures living their lives as we are - but with differencies being the outcome of different life decisions etc. The movie here is showing all the abstract versions of ourselves which will push some of it's audience away - which is understandable as not everyone is imaginative enough to grasp it.

It was a mind boggling experience full of moral principles which we tend to ignore in our daily life. If nothing matters after all - what will you value the most?",9

16 March 2023,I'm Shocked at the Rating and the Eclectics,"Earlier, this movie would have been rated less than 4-5 out of 10. You can only appreciate this movie if you are Brain Frozen for a couple of hours.

I have seen such amazing Oscar winning movies in the past and I was never suspicious it Academy Awards could ever be sold but this time it is pretty evident that either the jury was lavishly awarded or they were smoking something really weird.

All in all, a must watch movie just for the sake of understanding the sheer stupidity and hype behind it. I don't think I can ever look at the Academy Awards the same way I used to see. The lost respect for the jury might never be regained.

19 November 2022,Great movie,"This movie made me extremely happy and hopeful. It's an amazing philosophical examination and a family drama masquerading as an action movie to appeal to wider audiences. This movie is funny, bold, creative, maybe cheesy at times, but overall it's a profound movie.

The central theme of the movie is the battle between nihilism and absurdism (or existentialism). Nihilists say that the universe is meaningless and our lives are pointless. The antagonist of this story is a nihilist and wants to wallow in sadness and gloom. Existentialists and absurdists both attempt to solve the problems created by nihilism. Existentialists believe that since the universe is meaningless we are free create meaning of our own, and that is a beautiful thing. Absurdists argue that the universe is absurd and meaningless and one must find happiness in the absurd.

This movie presents all of these philosophical ideologies and does justice to them in my opinion.",10

12 September 2022,Awful,"This movie is an ultra bizar copy of Matrix. By far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's confusing, mixed with some forced comedy touch and filled with many copycat references from one of the best trilogies ever made. Everything Everywhere All at Once is beside Memento as one of the worst movies ever made and abnormally rated. Believe me, do not waste 2 hours and a half of your life watching this. I don't know how this could be rated 8.0 on IMDb right now. Normally rates are very precise here, therefore to try to scale down this anomaly I'll be rating it as low as possible.

Good luck to the ones that wanna attempt to watch it.

1 January 2023,One of the best movies ever!!! Instant cult classic.,"Leave your judgements at the door and buckle your seatbelt. I couldn't stop laughing after watching, just remembering parts. I watched it again and got even more out of it. Amazing acting - I would have trouble selecting my favourite because all the leads were phenomenal. Original characters like Deirdre Bobeirdre will be cult favourites - way to go Jamie Lee Curtis!

This is a deeply moving story with many layers, told through humour and imagination. If you are easily offended and rigid in your thinking perhaps it is not for you, but I'd encourage opening your mind and taking a journey. You may see the world a little differently.

It's an edge-of-your seat thriller, a side-splitting comedy, a tender love story, a tear jerker, a horror movie, a sci-fi, an action pic. It's about life, infinite universes, and everything. It's both an emotional roller coaster and a deeply thought-provoking meditation on the meaning of life. At its heart, though, is a simple tale of love mislaid and found again. The acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the direction is perfect; even the music is wonderful. Thankfully it is not actually all at once, but its 140 minutes of undiluted delight fly by way too fast. It's worth a second viewing. Or a third.

5 January 2023,A master piece with a beautiful message,"The movie I can recommend with no doubt . Best of 2022. Ignore all the negative reviews and give a watch .All the actors did their job very well . Try to concentrate on the story and message what writer want to say . The message about what we fight and stuck with our thoughts of everywhere , of different place in our mind and stuck with our pain suffer that cause of fight between people . Be kind to everyone even you are dealing with your own problems , as you others also can be on same position. Don't let your anger turn into fights. Please watch it . This movie is added in my most favourite list ‚ù§ Really a great concept .. hats off ‚úå‚úå

20 August 2022,Simply the Best,"This is the type of movie that comes along once in a decade. Maybe even once every two decades. I saw this movie on an awful date, and the movie was still the greatest film I've ever seen in a physical theater. The first thing I did when I got home was put the movie in my Top 25 Favorite Films. This is the best movie I have seen since the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020. Michelle Yeoh deserves an Oscar for Best Actress for this role. I can't speak more highly of this movie.

28 July 2022,Holly Bagel,"As the name suggests the film is long and messy. Worth it, though. It keeps you watching it. I am not sure if those fighting scenes also should be that much long. Stil the idea and the symbols are well organized. Oh btw I love the idea of bagel. Good work.

10 June 2022,Overrated Garbage,"Is there anyone left who remembers what a movie is? This is not. Incredibly antipatic actresses and actors which will hurt your eyes while watching and in approx. 1 hour mark you'll think yourself what am I watching now? This is not even a movie. Complete garbage and overrated piece of trash.

So many feelings all at once with this movie, its hard to feel comfortable watching this and that is a good thing! You need to be watching every second or you will miss something. The cinematography was outstanding, I highly reccomend this to anyone without a closed mind!

28 September 2023,"Best film I've ever seen, yet I understand why others don't like it.","This film was really incredible. It literally changed my view on life. I started to look at my things in life differently and appreciate them differently. I used to get lost in the smallest things before the film and was afraid of what I would become. In the end, I'm just a small dot in an infinitely big universe anyway, what's the point of worrying about small things? Besides, the film showed me that there is beauty in everything, and you don't need a perfect life to be happy, even the worst version of yourself can find love and happiness. I know the film is not for everyone and everyone has a different opinion of the film. I personally loved it without question. I've never seen a film that took me away like that, but everyone is different, so I can completely understand why the film was too chaotic or crazy for some people.

19 May 2022,A stunning Visual and Story Masterpiece!,"I have to say I don't do many reviews, but this Movie deserves respect and admiration beyond anything else.

From the start to finish it was a complete Masterpiece, a visual and emotional rollercoaster where the main character explores her relationship with her father, husband and daughter in a way that you simply cannot image and comprehend beforehand.

I have watched more than 10,000 titles in my life and I have to say that my life would definitely be incomplete without this title.

It is something that you have not and might not experience ever again. EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE!

17 April 2022,My head hurts,"It had a few funny moments, but most lf it was just pretty goofy shock value type of stuff. And man was it long, I thought the sun would be coming up when I left the theater. Had they taken the basic concept and with the same actors, gotten rid of some of the artsy screen flashing montages, silly jumping pad stuff and shaved off 30 minutes towards the end I think this would be a pretty good movie. How it is sitting at nearly a 9/10 is beyond me.

17 December 2022,Wonderful,"Certainly one of the best films of 2022, if not the best,and I've seen quite a lot of them this year... One of those stories that takes a place in your soul for a long time. Strangely deep, moving, hilarious, crazy imaginative. Michelle Yeoh shines like always, fantastic performance. We also get to watch on screen again the beloved ShortRound from Indiana Jones, who also delivers brilliantly. There's still a big smile on my face hours after watching, it made me feel obliged to write this review, the first one in a long time. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, it will change at least your day, you won't regret.

1 April 2023,A shot of life into your soul,"I don't know how to express how beautiful this movie is. It has everything on it, and every part of it is put together so perfectly. It's inevitable to feel all kind of emotions, and all the things you feel are very different from each other. Love, sadness, joy, laugh, fear... you have comedy, drama, absurdity, martial arts, romance, science fiction, and more, all at once while the story is unfolding perfectly. The music, the photography, the dialogues, nothing feels repetitive and you have the perfect amount of information to live every scene as you should and prepare you, at the same time, for what's next.

It probably sounds like I loved the movie so much and I'm a 'fan' and I'm not being objective on other aspects of the film. I don't know about the flaws that it may have because it doesn't matter at the end. At the end you are a creature that just got off of a rollercoaster of emotions and probable you are already seeing your life with different eyes. Maybe I am a fan. Maybe this is the only thing that I am a fan of.

This is my very first review here in IMDB because I couldn't help it. I couldn't not say anything about this beautiful movie. I don't know hoy many of you will read this, and I'm sure a lot of you will disagree with me, it would be very understandable. I can just say about what the movie made me feel to me, with my baggage, with my mind.

Thank you to all the people that made this movie.",10
13 August 2023,Closest thing to an acid trip,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",10
23 May 2022,"I would say it's like a fancy dreaming , it's chaos but inspired , I awoke with a smile on my face!","This film is completely beyond my expectations , I mean both of production and story telling makes me eyes opening , this is a fresh topic for film makers for sure , less people would willing to using a western comedy way to tell a eastern family's struggle , In my opinion , a word form Latin called "" modus vivendi "" are totally described how I understand a most Chinese family style , they accommodate and blame each other and depend on each other , therefore, it is kind of symbiosis relationship.

I am enjoyable of what present on screen , no matter character setting,camera language,art design and acting is great and creative, love to see different Asian culture been shown but not overused. In addition, philosophy discussed is make people thought-provoking , when I saw this movie , it make me remind a famous sentence ""There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is and to love it."" Even I seen thousand of possible future , I still chose to live my life and love you.

In the last , I wanna shout out to Michelle Yeoh , first time I know about her is cause the film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" by Ang Lee (my respectful director btw :) , I never thought in 2022 I can see astonishing new image from her , Thanks for her contribute , this movie just like tailored for her .

Thanks Daniels and all the crew members to create this amazing gift to audience , I can promise this will be my favorite in this 2022 .",9
7 February 2023,"Touching- and that's the Asian bro from the ""Goonies""","Open your mind and enjoy this loving, touching movie. You will be smiling at the end. Very original. The cast does a great job. A couple scenes were defiantly odd- but whatever. This movie had everything. Didn't want to stop watching. You will love Joy's outfits. Not only is that the bro from the ""Goonies""- but there is also another bro that was the bad guy in ""Big Trouble in Little China"". AND the lady from the bowel yogurt commercials does an epic job as well. Very cool premise for a movie that you can watch by yourself or with people you care about. I spend like 45 minutes of my life searching for movies some nights- on the 10 different apps we have and rarely end up this satisfied with my choices. This was a pleasant surprise. It's a feel good movie. Promise.

16 March 2023,I tried to get into it but gave up halfway through,"I tried to get into this movie. I gave up halfway through. It has got to be the most uninteresting film I've seen in a long time. Frenetic, disjointed, and irritating. I doubt that I would have felt differently had I watched it until the end. I'm surprised that it won so many Oscars. Critics have raved about it and usually there is a glimmer of truth in what they report. Not for this movie, at least not for me. The opening scenes were fine, and I wish the movie could have continued along in that manner. But it moved into bizarre territory and stayed there. Bizarre can be ok, but in this movie, it wasn't. I couldn't make sense of most of what happened nor did I care to. I agree with other users here who said that there are better films to watch if one wants to find out what life may have been like if one had made different life choices.

15 August 2022,The perfect movie for right now,"I am blown away by this movie. It feels inspired in all its aspects, as heavy and profoundly tapped in to the human expirience as possible, and still fun actionpacked and visually stunning. Its hard to say what is best about this whole excersice in movie magic. But one of the thing is deffinitly Michelle Yoeh. In many ways this was a part only she could do, and then to play it in this way, it makes you just be happy to be living in this particular universe.

In a time where diverse casting and the wokeness culture sometimes seems to be a mold growing on the movie business, this movie seems to be getting it all right. Giving a loving insight in an asian immigrant familie, handeling the struggles of LGBTQ stuff in a way that speaks to all with a heart. And all this as a sidenote to a story on depression, family, love and the depth of human expirience, wich it also hits out of the park.

Cannot recommend enough. Don't be forced to slap yourself in a few years when you see it and could have seen it in the cinema today.",10
25 May 2022,Drugs via cinema,"I would like to start by saying please make sure you see this in the cinema to get the full experience.

I believe the film is about depression or at least existentialism.

This movie touched me deeply, writing this review makes me want to cry but in a good way. I really connected with the films values, the daughters view on the world and relationship with her mother.

I think like a lot of people, we have all been really questioning the meaning and purpose of our lives the past couple of years and it can all get quite dark and lonely and confusing.

This film depicts these thoughts but in a funny and uplifting way. I felt like a child again, there are the most random and ridiculous and silly scenes that had me and the rest of the cinema belly laughing.

There was also scenes which had me in floods of tears.

I came out feeling like I'd had 5 tabs of acid I still feel different and can't help thinking of this film and will do for a long time I need to see it again.",9
10 October 2022,MINDBENDING,"THIS is not just a film it is a journey of emotion- love, happiness ,family drama ..it is althouth a sifi fantasy but its gives you a great message about respect somne or support them for what they are ...love your child feel their feeling and not just force your feelings on them.. now come to the technical part what a cinematography sceenplay, camera work action and how they filmed..hats off.. it will give you the vibe of intesteller and inception .. and all of the above how they conneted all the dots together..if you haven't watched it yet please go and wath..it will be a treat.. go and watch now,,

26 December 2022,Excellent,"Excellent movie. Very well done. The cast is amazing and all so such a great job. Michelle Yeoh has been solid recently in her roles but steps her game up this time I couldn't take my eyes off of her. It was much deeper and thought provoking than I could have imagined. The importance of relationships in life really hit deep. This is the first I've seen Stephanie Hsu in anything and I am a fan. She plays all sides of her role to perfection. As always Jamie Lee Curtis delivers. The amount of characters each character had to play really intrigued me. Ke Huay Quan makes such a great comeback into the acting world. I can't believe that kid from the goodies turned out to become a very good actor. This was an instant love for me and can't wait to watch again. When you watch a movie that you immediately want to watch again you know you have a hit.

31 December 2022,A Visual and Emotional Masterpiece!,"From start to finish, this film takes you through a roller coaster of emotions whilst leaving you breathless as to how each scene was pieced together. Rarely am I on the floor crying tears of laughter, sadness, and joy in the same film.

There are many moving parts to this film... From the way the actors (especially Michelle Yeoh) draw you into the screen, to the Daniel's expert directing, this film has it all, well almost all.

The one thing that will prevent you from enjoying this masterpiece, is by getting hung up and clashing with the point that it is trying to make. This film offers a take on nihilism and lifestyle choices that will be distasteful to some. This however is in no way an attack on the film itself. Among many other things, film is a storytelling medium, and when a story is told well and in a compelling way anyone can enjoy it even when they disagree with the point that it is trying to make.

All in all, this film is definitely worth seeing!",10
27 May 2023,Absolutely the worst!,"I hesitated writing a review because I don't enjoy being negative. However this is the worse movie I've ever seen! Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was a better film than this one!

And I'm pissed because of all the hype, all the Oscars given for this terrible film. I can only surmise the Oscar's we're given to somehow ""prove"" the academy is not racist; why else would they have awarded any Oscars at all?

Don't get me wrong, I love Michelle Yeoh and I can think of at least 2 of her movies that greatly deserved awards but had been shunned by the Academy. I loved all the main actors in this movie but they really must be embarrassed by how bad this movie is, I feel sorry for them.

8 October 2022,Amazing,"Absolutely mind blowing. One of thos films that hit you in a way that you did not expect going into it.

It dives deep into the concepts of family, love, acceptance, culture, destiny, fate and the world we live in, witchout ever coming across preachy or forced.

The decisions we make and the people we choose to become affects our lives and everyone around us.

It is also very funny, light hearted and surreal, honestly a rollercoaster of human emotions were felt while watching it.

It has been a while since I felt gobsmacked by a film.

The performances were very real and heartfelt and the film is also visually stunning.

Please give this film a chance.",10
3 September 2023,Existential breakthrough,"I normally don't write reviews but I must say this film was made for those going through an existential crisis and have been going to therapy for years trying to understand why they feel the way they do. It's for though who are on a spiritual enlightenment journey who see how deep films like Star Wars and Interstellar and Inception are - this film is your breakthrough. It was so insightful and mind blowing, you should definitely get high for this one but if that's not for you, it's still good. It has a heartwarming ending that really solidifies that 'only love is real' - it is the most powerful force.

1 May 2023,VERY suprised of the Oscar....,"First up. Maybe not even 3 stars, potentially a 1. Oscar? I see nothing here. In all honesty, watched about 30 minutes. What a complete mess. Acting was average. Weak plot from the get go. Too many cliches. Nothing captivating. Other reviews were correct with it having no cohesion. Maybe I need to finish it? Extremely rarely I will turn off a film without finishing it. Basically it was quite bad! So suprised!! And it got an Oscar and such high rating here?! Wow...

Not recommended. I mean give it a try but something I missed? Kept waiting and it got worse.... Was like splinter in my finger, painful to watch almost. Good luck haha!

Yes, it has ""cheap"" comedy, otherwise it would be too heavy for the general public, and it complements the movie very well.

15 June 2022,Avoid the trailer if at all possible.,"Chances are, if you're on IMDB reading this review, you've seen the auto-playing trailer for this movie, which is a shame. While it doesn't ""spoil"" anything, the element of surprise for my wife and I tonight (after not reading anything about it or seeing the trailer) was off-the-charts. Avoid reading about this movie as much as possible. BOTTOM LINE: This was a cinematic masterpiece. I haven't laughed or cried this much in a movie in many many years. And to be clear, the tears were not from sadness. This movie will blow your mind.

19 May 2022,Most original movie made in years.,"Being a huge fan of Michelle Yeoh since the early 90', and a big fan of the supporting cast, I was highly anticipating this movie and expected much from it. It delivered on everything the trailer had promised and much more. I knew there would be action, and goofy comedy. What I had not been expecting was the emotional weight it carried. The relationships between Evelyn and every major supporting character in the film was complex and multidimensional, multi-universal! This movie had so many layers...it had everything, including an everything bagel!

The experiences and parallel dimensions in which our consciousness lives, experiencing all the possibilities at the same time, help us to understand and accept that what we are going through in this life of ours is nothing more than our experience, from the beginning of showing the lowest level of consciousness. In a stone to the complexity of the human being where we are subject to defects, problems, disappointments, frustrations, successes, achievements, losses, difficulties, union, forgiveness, kindness and love, learning to let go and learning to accept that everything we experience is not it is an experience and learning within this body in this dimension where we are!

This movie has so much heart, warmth and kindness in it. It's the best movie I've seen all year, it's one of the best I've seen in the last decade, it's Absolutely one of the best movies I've seen ever. Please watch this movie.

15 March 2023,"stupid, over rated, dumb","I watched this after all the hype with awards.

So outlandishly stupid and dumb and yes, overrated. How the f does it deserve oscars is beyond me. The judges were probably filling their diversity/representation quota.

This movie is an absolute mess! ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" tries to be clever and profound, but it only ends up being convoluted and nonsensical. The plot is confusing, the characters are one-dimensional, and the humor is cringe-worthy. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this garbage.

The filmmakers seem to think that throwing together random elements from different genres and cultures will make for an intriguing and original story, but all they achieved is a jumbled and chaotic mess. The special effects and action scenes are not enough to save this train wreck of a movie.

The worst part is that the film pretends to have a deeper message about identity and universality, but it's all superficial and unconvincing. The dialogue is filled with pseudo-philosophical gibberish that tries to sound profound but comes across as pretentious and meaningless.",2
14 August 2022,Fantastic!,"I just loved it. Very overwhelming but entertaining. The visuals were stunning and I had a few very good laughs. It didn't feel like anything I have ever watched before. Great movie, would recommend.

There can be some initial confusion but that's alright. A bit of patience and the matters take their own course.

As per the core of the film there will be something different for everyone.

Enjoy!

If you have not seen ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"", you should. It is brilliant! All four actors showed incredible range as actors in each version of their multiple characters! It is rare to see this in the same film! The Daniels are also worthy of many awards. All are truly brilliant artists!

23 May 2022,Giving the Multiverse-concept what it deserves,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Nor were the performances of Michelle Yeoh or Jamie Lee Curtis. There is a reason people no longer tune into awards shows anymore.....they are a farce! This movie and it's selection as Picture of The Year, Best Leading Actress and Best Supporting Actress shows the total lack of talent in Hollywood. It is a total slap in the face to outstanding performances by the other actors, directors and writers. No wonder people aren't going to movies these days. Foreign movies and acting is out pacing crap like this film. I would much rather see Something Else, Anywhere, Anytime and Not All At Once!

25 May 2022,Meaningful and entertaining,"Every aspect of life is a universe. The paradigm / governing thought controls how a person acts in a particular universe. Conflicting ideas fight each other in its own universe.

Everything: Our life consists of a lot of universes: meaning of life, sextual orientation, parents and children's needs, wants, and expectation of each other, dealing with other humans, dealing with laws, dealing with nature.... There are lots and lots of them. Hence, lots of universes.

Everywhere: Our mind and body thinks about and act in each of the universe in fractional seconds. So as we think or act, we are jumping among universes. Even though we do not see it physically, our minds are fighting each other in a particular universe just by thinking about it.

All at once: many meaningful ways to look at it. 1. All this is happening at all times in each person's life. 2. Explodes when conflicting thoughts materialize into action. Ex. Two people thought about how much they hate each other. Arguments/Fights will happen when they meet and discuss how much they hate each other. 3. When involved people CSIPed (Processed with Complete and Successful Intellectual Process) their thoughts about all of their conflicting thoughts in each universe. Their minds and souls converge and become harmonious in the corresponding universe.

Great movie. As good as Forrest Gump if not better.",10

1 July 2022,Mirror of My Mind,"As an Asian American woman, I was eager to see a strong Asian cast. I love science fiction and psychology, so watching this movie was an intense and rewarding experience. I see the multiple interpretations of real and imaginary. In my own mind, I see many what ifs and often fantasize about a better life. The acting, visual effects are superb. Even if you just absorb the absurdity and laugh at the comedic parts, it is worthwhile and entertaining. I highly recommend this movie.

It was quite literally ""everything, everywhere, all at once"". I laughed. I pondered. I sobbed. If you felt this movie was messy, and didn't like it, and decided to leave a bad rating, you didn't understand it, and you never will, unfortunately, because it is a beautiful film with a powerful message that brought me to the most tears I have ever cried in one sitting. This film is moving, powerful, emotional, a good laugh, a great visual, and an original concept that was well put together. DEFINITELY go watch. You won't regret it.

I am fully impressed by the imagination, the power of emotion and the unique way of intepreting family relationship. In some way we are all ordinary heroes of our daily routine life that seems to repeat endlessly. It's time to change the way of our way of perceiving our lives, our beloved ones and of course, a change of mindset is the most important thing of all. Let's start to think out of the box, and see little things in our lives in a new perspective, we will find out how many possibilities our life could hold. My appreciation to all the actors, actress and the whole team working behind the scene, a beautifully told story, a masterpiece.

27 May 2022,Original at its best,"I guess people are divided about this movie, so, I decided to put my own review. The multiverse concept on this movie has deeper explanation compare to the Marvel. I have no idea which of these three (EEAaO, No Way Home & Multiverse of Madness) that is closer to the multiverse scientific knowledge, but, EEAaO is just on another level. But, yet, it simplicity, without the extravagant of ""magic book"" or ""shooting spiders' webs"".

I just love this movie. A lot. The ending is satisfyingly good.

21 July 2023,Amazingly overrated,"I can't believe this film won so many Oscars, goes to show the academy has truly lost their sense of what great cinema is.

Mildly funny, and often forced, 5th grade humor and mostly slapstick comedy is considered genius now?

Also blatantly and shamelessly ripped multiple things off from The Matrix including bullet time and the concept of a savior character who needs to unlock her powers, ""downloading"" knowledge - this movie is far from original or inventive.

Yes it's entertaining, a little trippy at times, nothing mind blowing if you're familiar with the concept of a multi dimension universe - this take on it is far from believable by any means even with suspended disbelief and wasn't very entertaining, Spider-Man did the concept 10x better.",5

1 September 2022,"Magical, surprising, and bizarre","This movie was a real exception! With the creative plot, it's lovely characters, various mix from humor, suspense and great fighting scenes, it doesn't fit to any box, but to its very own one!

The story starts with the Chinese women Evelyn, who is the owner of a laundromat and lives a very normal life. The daily struggle of clients, family problems and a tax review is suddenly broken when somebody from a different universe enters her life.

Suddenly an exciting adventure starts for her, where she slips in many others versions of herself to fight for nothing less than saving all connected universes.

10 stars for this wonderful pieces of movie art!

15 October 2022,MIndblowing!!,"Everything at once everywhere is a film that will not leave you indifferent. It is an accumulation of action, effects and a lot of humor. No doubt I would say that it is one of those films that mark you in one way or another, to me in this case for its photography and special effects.

It lasts 2h 20', maybe at the beginning it can be a bit heavy until it starts to develop. However, it is worth watching it until the end because it improves at times although from the first minute it surprises you in a very spectacular way audiovisually speaking. There is no scene that is the same as the previous one.

I wanted to highlight the performance of Jonathan Ke Quan, who plays the husband of the protagonist. He's a super charismatic character and it's partly why the film works so well because of the duo that the leading lady (Michelle Yeoh) plays.

The film is divided into two acts, which is something different from what is commonly. Seen in mainstream cinema.

Besides being a movie full of visual effects and fights, there is also time to get reflective, something that is appreciated.

Undoubtedly, highly recommended.",8
19 June 2022,Best movie of the decade.,"When I first heard of the new sci fi movie, meant to be for best movie of the decade I was skeptical. I knew I had to watch it for myself and it delivered. Truly one of the greatest movies this decade, if not ever. Hands down the most original premise with near flawless executions. The way they can address such mature topics in new insightful ways is something far more movies should aim to do.

Truly a modern masterpiece of cinema.

20 June 2022,Made me cry happy tears,"I made an IMDb account just to talk about this movie. I really needed something like this, especially after all the stress and chaos that's been the last couple of years. It's so refreshing to see a movie that's just so unabashedly weird and chaotic and fun. It's so refreshing to see a movie with style and passion. You could tell, from the acting to the cinematography to the script, that there was so much passion poured into EEAAO. And the message that it isn't shameful or weak to be kind? That being hopeful is a valid way to survive in this universe? That things can change for the better? It's wonderful to see a message like that on the big screen. This was a true gem of a movie and I'm not going to shut up about it for a while.

14 March 2023,I Gave it One Star Because I couldn't give 0 stars,"This is the worst movie I've ever watched. It reminds me of Springtime For Hitler, a play created to bomb that somehow becomes a success. I have no idea what the Academy saw in this movie vs Tar, All Quiet on The Western Front, or any of the other contenders. Similarly, I have no idea how these actors won Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress. If the Academy wants to reward ethnic actors and give Jamie Lee Curtis a Lifetime Achievement Award, then just do it. Don't clog up the awards with manufactured winners. This movie is a piece of garbage with no redeeming qualities. I read that it was made for only $20mm, given what I've seen, it probably could have been made for $1.50...and even that would be a stretch. Do yourself a favor and skip it.

29 July 2023,The research they undertook shows!,"After hearing that the creators of this movie did multiple years of research into the possibility of a multiverse, I thought the idea sounded like a piece of art.

What amazed me was the way that the complexity of the subject which amazes so many of us (real or not) was conveyed in an understandable but artistic way. The film hit incredibly with all friends I've watched with and has been the first film in the last couple of years which has left an impact on my mind, the way I think and my interest in scientific theories. The weight of the film was tangible and I was lost in the story (although confusing but in the way I believe it was intended for the average viewer). It is a true stand alone classic and I will come back to watch for many years.

Apparently random or unpredictable behaviour in systems governed by deterministic laws.

To generate our thoughts, our brains create this amazing lightning storm of connection patterns networks organize into a fractal like pattern, but when our thinking is disrupted in some way, those patterns lose their integrity and start to break down...

But I'd like to add what I felt watching this movie. This movie dropped at the right time in this universe for people like me whose family is going through times, barely hanging onto by a thread. It's an every household story, but with the help of the concept of multiverse.

Themes of family, kindness, selfishness & selflessness, unending commitment to love, etc echoes loud throught the whole journey.

This movie is a case study and will be studied by film schools for generations.

Although it was very ambitious and occasionally funny in a slightly campy way, I'm flabbergasted at the positivity about this ill thought out, hotchpotch of disparate cinema genres.

The idea of exploring the multiverse through the prism of Kung-fu fighting and kinky sex is ludicrous.

Maybe it will become a cult film best watched while tripping but definitely not the 'profound' experience people are describing here...

12 December 2022,A film for broken Asian kids,"I am curious if a viewer from a completely different culture background could relate to the feelings in this movie. From what I can see, it's not only about to love, to be kind, rather a first generation immigrant trying fo fix herself. She's in between of a traditional Asian family, and a daughter born in the west. She's the one character in this movie struggled the most, and put in the most effort into everything. She's never good enough for her parents, and never good enough for her daughter.

I am happy there's a movie out there touching this part of the world. The feeling it brought me can't be simply rated.

The wacky action sequences are just amazing.

And I mean that in a good way. They took the best of those and made their own masterpiece.

The title suits it very well. The plot was ambitious and at any point could have been a chance to mess up. But it didn't.

Cast is awesome. And it had everything!

Humor, Action, Special effects and Heart.

One second you're watching an impressive fight scene, the next you're LOLing, then you'd get teary eyed.

At times cheeky but not corny.. heartwarming but not melodramatic.

It has a love story embedded in it without being the typical unnecessary cheesy stuff.

Romantic love, love for family, love of a parent, love for others. Generational curse.

This puts Doctor Strange's effort at depicting a ""Multiverse"" to shame.

15 October 2022,Thank you.,"Just. Yeah. Exceeded any expectations. Then kept going. Amazing. Best movie I have seen in the last four years. If you want to escape your reality, this is a must watch. Really turns the whole genre of alternate universes on its head and brings it straight back home. Forget your Marvel way of looking at things and, instead go for what's important in your universe. Cinematically outstanding, a top notch casting. Although I will say it most definitely has put me off hotdogs for a very loooong time!!!!!

Watch this movie. Unless you sell hot dogs for a living. In that case maybe you've made the wrong choice in this universe. Lol.

15 March 2023,Don't watch even 2 minutes,"The most ridiculous movie I've ever seen in my life. A bad movie that has nothing to do with logic and morality. Don't even watch this 2 hour movie for 2 minutes. Getting an Oscar doesn't make a movie good. There are hundreds of non-reward films that touch the hearts of the audience.

What does good movie mean? Beautiful movie is love movies between Man and woman. Like the ""Titanic"". Good movies are action movies, like ""Die Hard"". Good movies are detective crime movies, like ""Se7en"". Good movies are family movies, like a ""Everybody's Fine"".

This movie is too bad. This bad movie has nothing to do with family, morality, or love between man and woman. If I had 500 years to live, I would not watch such immoral films even for 5 minutes.

1 October 2023,"beyond imagination, a movie who celebrate creativity and the Joy of Existence","Everything about this movie is good, the actor, the humour, the story, the vfx. This movie is one of the most original and entertaining i have seen. Its one of the very few movie that i can give a 10/10 without a hesitation. The actors are very well written and relatable, its also a very big come back for the actor Ke Huy Quan. But what make this movie very different and unique from the other one is the Originality of the story, and the capacity to make such a good movie with such low budget and low number of people ¬®for example 5 artists working on the vfx¬®. If you are looking for a movie that will make you cry, laugh and deeply think about the meaning of life, existence and consciousness, its for you.

20 May 2022,This movie pulled so many emotions out of me.,"The range and intensity of emotions this film elicited from me was nothing short of stunning. Laughter, tears, curiosity, anxiety, awe, dismay, and more. At times it feels like pure information overload, and and other parts, time slows to a crawl as you savor one particular scene, moment, feeling. I cannot recommend this movie enough. People look for different things in a film: perhaps to see something visually appealing, perhaps to escape from reality for a while, perhaps to learn some important life lessons, or perhaps just to experience something new. This film has all of that. Give it a watch: whether you end up liking it or not, you will definitely experience something you've definitely never experienced before, intensely. 10/10.

28 July 2022,The ultimate in film versatility.,"Everything everywhere all at once rides this fine line between being humorous and heartfelt, complicated and sincere, and meaningful but not preachy. Great acting is combined with the most innovative direction of the decade turns this silly multiverse-action-comedy-drama into a near masterpiece.

The movie is not meant for all, however. About as many walked out weeping by the touching ending as did disturbed by alternate universe antics mid way through. The movie is packed, and a little hard digest given it's breakneck speed over an above average run time. Some might find it hard to reconcile excellent, introspective dialogue bookended by crude slapstick gags.

Despite some minor flaws, Everything Everywhere all at Once is a shoe-in for best direction and best cinematography, and very well may be the best movie of 2022.

20 May 2022,This is the real Multiverse of Madness we were looking for.,"Since I saw the trailer of Everything Everywhere All at once, I was very excited to watch it. And trust me it was worth the wait. The whole concept of multiverse is explored in a very interesting and fresh way what Doctor strange couldn't do. It starts with the protagonist doing taxes to doing the most absurd things once can't imagining doing in right mind. The entire launching pad stuff gives a fun element to the movie. The heartwarming end made the movie a must-watch. Definitely one of the best movies and underrated movies of 2022.

My Rating 8/10.

No art. Stupid comedy, self parody, annoying, super hero for children film.

Cannot understand how this film could be nominated to oscar! Impossible to win oscar in this universe!!

Do not see this film

8 July 2022,Avalanche of silliness. Lasts 45 minutes too long. Should have had more breathers with real life acting in between all the silliness.,"The bad: it lasts way too long. 45 minutes should have been cut out of it, because there is a limit to how much silliness I can stumach non-stop.

More bad: this story CONSTANTLY shifts between reality and fantasy, up to a point that it gets REALLY ANNOYING to watch. But perhaps game marinated teenager brains wont mind that at all?

Not any good then? It's really a wonderfully creative movie, with excellent photography, excellent choreography. It's definitely something else...

There is also a great role by Jamie Lee Curtis as some kind of psychopathic old IRS lady for which she even won an Oscar!

This movie is simply not my cup of tea, because this movie does not know when to breath, when to have a pause and let REAL characters interact with each other, instead of fantasy ones.

It's too much of a gimmick for me. It could have been a lot better if there had been a better tightknit direction, because in it's core it is a fascinating magical story...

Suited for who? I honestly do not know, because this is one of the weirdest Oscar winners in history...",5
6 March 2023,Knock ... Knock ... Who is there?,"I'll tell you whose not there. There's no film producer. There's no film director. There's DEFINITELY no film editor because this supposedly highly acclaimed film that has suspiciously garnered eleven (11) Academy Award nominations in March 2023 left me and Mrs. Shullivan at our open front door looking around for what the heck all the buzz was about this piece of garbage?

I cannot emphasize enough how disappointed that Mrs. Shullivan and I were after investing some $40 for a 4K copy of this film when it was initially released which I rarely do but I proceeded with my advance copy of the film based solely on the eleven (11) Academy Award 2023 nominations that the film attained.

I am using the analogy of a ""Knock Knock"" joke because this film is delivered in three (3) chapters (just like a Knock ... Knock .... Knock joke) all which were basically a mirror image of each other with total chaos being the premise and an underlying theme of the strained relationship between the Laundy Mat owner and mother Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) and her daughter Joy Wang (Stephanie Hsu).

Mrs. Shullivan and I kept waiting for the tempo to slow down but instead the Chinese western theme continued throughout with fight, after fight after fight through the Disneyland eyes of a poor copy of the 1940 Fantasia film.

Hey my wife and I are senior citizens and our days of experimenting with hallucinatory drugs are decades behind us. Maybe, just maybe the film critics who are praising this piece of garbage went to a screening and instead of chomping on M&M's and Caramel popcorn they were fed some potent hallucinatory drugs and spiked Kool-Aid and then attended a big after party afterwards. Otherwise I cannot in my wildest dreams comprehend how this film pulled off such a big scam on the general public.

I hope the general public isn't drinking their Kool-Aid and I also suggest if this film comes knocking at your door ..... DON'T ANSWER IT!

I give the film a very disappointing 3 out of 10 IMDb rating.",3
24 March 2023,"Garbage, absolute garbage","Usually, I don't write movie reviews but this time had to make an acception. I tried to watch this irritating movie till the end but I didn't succeed and left before the end from cinema. I watched some 90 minutes and had no interest how this story will end. It would be to much to try explain everything that is wrong with this movie...it is simply annoying from the beginning and it doesn't improve even a little bit later. It just gets more and more irritating.

Before watching this movie I checked it's rate at IMBD and this is maybe the first movie with high rating at almost 8 that I don't like.

Can't believe this film won 7 Oscars.

30 March 2023,Oscar Self-Destructs,"The movie has everything everywhere all at once that today's younger audience might want from movies: it's frantically paced, crazily plotted and doesn't follow any of the traditional notions of clarity or coherence. As science fiction, it makes Star Wars and Star Trek seem like outdated museum pieces. It has the feel and look of an endless video game - a movie where rules don't apply and there are no real consequences for anyone, anywhere.

The only ingredient that registers with any brain that might be in the audience is the talent of the performers who, as professional actors, remind us of what better movie roles hopefully wait for them in the future.

Try to imagine trivial, mindless entertainments from the past, like Blazing Saddles or Animal House, winning the Best Picture Oscar; or even higher quality sci-fy movies like Alien or Zardoz - once upon a time, it seems, there were standards. The votes this received for Best Picture must surely have been cast by members who think the Academy has reached the end of the line.

Sadly, maybe it has.",3
6 May 2023,What did I just watch...,"I just watched this film by virtue of it being a multi-Oscar winner. I was well rested and of clear mind but still found the film difficult to follow.

It's a film that focuses on a migrant laundromat owner who in essence, I can only deduce, is trying to patch up the relationship with her daughter while also experiencing a faltering relationship with her husband.

The core of this film is sweet and well-intentioned but the way it is filmed is nauseating and difficult to follow. Some might say the special effects are part of the appeal, but personally I did not find the experience pleasant at all. The film is also far too long for what it aims to deliver.

16 April 2023,Interesting but boring and extremely over-hyped,"I stated once and stopped after 15 mins , then gave it another try as a result of all the hype . What was that? Seemed like a cheap video tape of the 80s. Overly simplistic, amateurish special effects (pretentiously intentional). What was the hype all about? What were the Oscars for except for making up for the past guilt on the Asian American community? I watched Tetris on the same day and there was no comparison between the 2 movies . If they idea is to create a mess in the name of art, then yes , the movie achieved it . Imagine an Asian version of the guardians of the Galaxy mixed up with some more non- sense and this is it .

NO, NO & NO ..... The Golden Raspberry Awards at most!

The Godfather, Forest Gump, Gladiator, Titanic, Braveheart, Schindler's List, The Silence of the lambs, Dances with wolfes, Rain man, Platoon, Rocky, etc,

is this really in the line with these Oscar Winners?

And it is not that I judge by american, non-american, chiniese, non-chiniese, politically driven, non-politically driven, lgbt driven, non-lgbt driven ... but HOW on earth the makers of this movie pulled the wool over the eyes of the Accademy members (sic!)

29 May 2023,Well Acted Pandering,"I love Michelle Yeoh, and movies that show loving what you have but this? This was idiotic.

Albeit the acting and action was very well done (Is that Data from Goonies kicking butt?!) this brain vomit of mixed signals doesn't deserve them.

Jamie Lee acurtis shows up to be, fat Jamie Lee Curtis and tries to demand we find her charming. She isn't nor are her disgustingly bad scenes.

Moreover the real message pressed is; 'Dammit you dumb old people, stop being old, and make grandpa be excited about lesbians!' Also, enough whinging and you can break the universe.

A wildly overworked mother gets smacked around by all the whiney brats desperate for her attention, RIGHT NOW! ... Could her husband really not wait until dinner, at least, to drop a bomb on her? Daughter is mad because her family is out right screaming with joy she's gay, they're ONLY accepting. The nerve! Her father is apparently an ass, but we never actually see that.

Oh, and be careful who you watch this with, or you may end up in uncomfortable, wildly unexpected, conversations about sex toys... What was the point of that, movie? Seriously, how did this move the story along?

Although I found the things needed for travel funny most times, it got really stupid, really quickly. It's somewhat like a small child trying to show you how gross they can be, passing gas in a tub and hoping you'll laugh. This doesn't fit with the 'message' or rhythm of the movie in any congruent way.

7 Oscars is huge and it will change cinema forever the film is not bad far from it but this consecration is not timely.

I'm a big fan of movies and when a movie motivates me I watch it in one go, this one on the other hand I stopped halfway a few months ago and never watched the end. It started well but then it became a series of shots seen and reviewed.

The Oscars are no more than a masquerade from now on. I'm not saying that the film is bad, but it's impossible for it to garner so many. I am even less motivated to finish it and unfortunately to understand what could have motivated so many prices.

I could only imagine it won Oscars because of the foreign content and gayness in the story. I have no issue with either of these and often watch movies with subtitles but give me a good story to follow and some decent acting. I normally don't write reviews but had to in this case.

You can tell from trailers this is more of a light, action drama. But if it wasn't for the fast unnecessary graphic edits or bizarre side scenes that didn't make any logical sense, it might've actually been an average ok film.

Still, no actors deserved any recognition for their roles. The acting was flat without real emotion. The script was stereotypical and predictable. The editing was nonstop and migraine inducing.

I couldn't wait to finish it. What a waste of time.

Acting was up to par with a B movie. The main characters seemed to have chemistry, but the supporting cast, (Jamie Lee Curtis included) really seemed to be afterthoughts that the Directors tried to fit into the story. The music and cinematography were adequate, but the costumes and make-up were very remedial. The special effects were average at best. One of the worst written movies I have ever seen. I would not recommend this movie.

Reminds me of Alexander Payne's Downsizing because that has an interesting idea so poorly executed that it took me forever to finish. I tried and tried but just couldn't see the point. Like Greenbook, Driving Miss Daisy, Shakespeare in Love, and Crash, it proves that the Oscars miss more often than not. Probably going to win best picture but not deserving of it. When even positive reviews call the acting over the top but it still yields 4 acting nominations, that means something is broken. This will do nothing but perpetuate Hollywood pandering generalizations.

14 January 2023,Too self indulgent to be called an epic,"What could had been a sweeping adventure like back to the future or zathura, is reduced to same thing happening over and over and over again for more than 2 hours. Its not as complex as it aims to be, neither its as engaging. To please the me-she-you audience, it throws some propaganda and lgbt gimmicks too, which adds nothing to the fray. Michelle Yeo and Ke Huay Quan are wasted. This is neither a time travel adventure, neither a time loop incident, and neither it is a miltiverse movie. Its too self-indulgent to be called any of these. Maybe someone from the team of jumanji or zathura or goosebumps or night at the museum should have handled this.

13 March 2023,Unwatchable,"Disclaimer: I only got thru an hour of this mess before I said: enough! What the hell am I doing??

Just because someone else thought this up doesn't make it good. This movie is a combination of the Joy Luck Club with Tron and the final result is horrible! Trying to follow the plot is not only impossible (maybe after 2:20hrs it makes sense but I wasn't going to find out) but also migraine inducing. There are tons of Kung Fu fighting scenes woven into ""seize the day"" life lessons with a horrible looking Jaime Lee Curtis playing a zombie apocalypse / terminator type killer while three people in a control room try to make life changing decisions for a mid fifties lady on the fly. If what I just wrote makes no sense, it's because it doesn't. And neither does this movie. Definitely the worst supposed plot and execution I've tried to watch in years, maybe ever.

13 March 2023,Top 3 worst movies of all time,"God be my witness if this movie deserves more oscars than Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Alfred Hitchcock and Christopher Nolan combined then so be it, this is one of the goofiest most overrated movies i have ever seen.

The movie is tantalizingly boring, I don't even know what to say about the plot.

Jamie Lee Curtis was great... 40 years ago.

Not to mention that besides the 7 undeserving oscars it has also won another 350 awards... For what? Batman 0 oscars, Elvis 0 oscars, The Banshees of Inisherin 0 oscars, Top Gun Maverick only 1 oscar. Pure robbery.

The academy has always been stupid but this is a new low even for them.

17 April 2022,Cheesy crap for simple-minded Americans,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Well Too bad, folks. This film was a nightmare.

It began with the most drawn out, boring, monotonous and headache inducing drivel I have seen in an art form in YEARS. I was honestly in pain trying to watch thing and after 35 minutes, my family and I gave up. What a mess this was.

At least its nice that James Hong is still around, cause hes cool, and of course the main actress used to be in tons of martial arts movies, so she WAS cool. But this film was a dud and unworth continuing a third of the way through. Avoid at all costs unless you are heavily medicated or intoxicated. Which, im sure, this film is geared towards folks under the influence. Many films are.",3
9 July 2022,"Boring, confusing and annoying","This movie starts so chaotic, I almost could not bear to keep watching. After 40 minutes I stopped. I was thinking every character in the movie has a serious form of ADHD. The first 30 minutes you don't have a clue what you are watching. I don't like that, within 10 minutes after the start of a movie I want to know what it is about. 2 instead of 1 star for. Michelle Yeoh (""Philippa Georgiou"").

15 March 2023,"Not ""everything"" to everyone","This movie was an absolute chore to sit through. Some might call its flourishes creative; i found them tedious and undisciplined. Also, behind all the gimmickry, I found the family story pretty banal and conventional. Lesbian daughter/disapproving mom drama? What year is it? This is tired stuff. The awards season run for this is just baffling. Jamie Lee Curtis has done some consistently good work but her performance here as, essentially, ""bad white woman"" is kind of cheap and grotesque. Michelle was fine but I've preferred her elsewhere (Shang Chi, Crazy Rich Asians, Crouching Tiger). I'm really only here for the Key Huy Quan comeback.

26 March 2023,Incomprehensible Gibberish,"This movie would have been a mega-smash in the drug-soaked 1960s when anything that made no sense at all was considered ""deep"". By the time this garbage was over, it had found a permanent niche in my ""Worst Movies Of All Time"" list.

It seemed like they hired a bunch of actors and told them to say the first thing that came into their minds. It certainly didn't help that the dialog kept switching between English and Chinese. Aside from the language, it (I hesitate to call it a ""plot"") bounces all over the place with little rhyme or reason. There wasn't a single character that I cared about in the least.

I'm sure that, if there really are alternate universes, the finished copies of the film were burned in all of them (except, sadly, ours).

16 March 2023,Awful.,"I turned it off after 35 minutes. Couldn't take the stupidity of it any longer. How in their right mind could the Oscar's award this pile of trash such a prestigious award is beyond me. It didn't have any type of plot. The movie was all over the place. Every Oscar nominated movie this year was better than this. I can't really make sense of all the critics positive and glowing reviews. Seems like the vast majority of the regular public truly sees this movie for what it is. An overhyped production that wasn't even worthy of a nomination. Let alone be the winner. It's a shame bad movies win Oscar's.

22 April 2023,Absolute garbage of a movie,"The movie started off well by introducing the main protagonists who were likeable and relatable at first. And then the entire movie turned into a complete mess and was all over the place. What followed was a very boring and dumb plotline, utter randomness of events, cringe-worthy acting, and humour that wouldn't count as funny or hilarious.

I am grateful I didn't listen to any of the degenerates who enjoyed the movie and gave it very high ratings as clearly, the movie neither deserved the high ratings, nor did it deserve those rigged Oscar awards.

I personally enjoy multiverse stories, but this one was nothing but a joke and is a waste of time. Clearly an overrated movie that is garbage and probably written by a bunch of 13-year old kids on crack.

16 March 2023,Just didn't enjoy it!,"I hate leaving low rating reviews but I was just do disappointed with this movie. I thought after winning all those Oscars I was in for a treat when I rented this movie, I got that wrong. I couldn't even bring myself to finishing it, I actually turned it off just after an hour which is really unlike me, I hate starting movies and not seeing them through but I just couldn't take it anymore. Stupid is a word I would use for it. Maybe messy too. Yes, a stupid messy movie. I don't know, perhaps it's me but I really don't recommend it. One good thing that drew me to it as well as the Oscars was ShortRound being in it but unfortunately that didn't improve it for me although his acting is good, so it's just the one star I'm afraid. Sorry to those that love it, but not me.

8 September 2023,Save 2 hours of your life and something else,"I start watching this film without any idea about what it is and without seeing any reviews. I just knew it won some awards.i thought that in the first 20 minutes the director had in mind to portray how first/second generation of Chinese Americans are struggling between native traditions and American way of life, grasping with daughter's homosexuality, trying to deal with issues in their relationship. And the performance of the actors was good. Then, they asked a 19 old art student to replace the director and he/she decided that the best way to move forward with this film is to make a film taramosalata with a hundred different ingredients, all mixed up very quickly in a fancy mixer and serve it in fancy plates. The result is an incoherent, distasteful, not funny end product that the only people that may enjoy it are those who don't want to be considered ""not cool"".

1 July 2022,"OVERWHELMING, TOO WEIRD, CHAOTIC & ALL OVER THE PLACE!","From a cinematographic/visual point of view, the film is something we have never seen before, combined with the concept of the multiverse, and it's true that the film was humorous at times. However it was very gross and utterly absurd and the constant frantic & chaotic fast-paced images/cinematography thrown at us combined with a mishmash of OTT Kung-Fu scenes and ridiculous, vulgar scenes (for a movie that lasted well over 2 hours) proved far too overwhelming, too absurd and weird to my taste!

I didn't enjoy this movie (my friend felt the same and even left the room 1 hour before the end of the film as she absolutely hated it!). I felt I couldn't connect emotionally with any of the characters, there wasn't much in terms of character depth... and it was hard and particularly exhausting to keep watching this film which was far too long... All I wanted to do is for it to be over...! I felt this film was all over the place... It didn't make much sense, and you certainly realise this even more so when the film comes to the conclusion that ""Nothing matters""... Needless to say, this movie left me empty and drained... - It just wasn't for me!",1
16 March 2023,"How could it get 7.8, and 11 Oscars?","All the reviews I've read so far seem to agree with my reaction: way overrated, more style than substance, no new profound message here and yes, it took great fortitude and forbearance to see it through to the end. My head is still ringing from the endless meaningless action and special effects sequences. I do not feel the slightest bit informed nor uplifted from having watched it through to the end. I will not be recommending it. Yes, I picked up on the message loud and clear about being kind and that it's ok to be gay and that parents need to let go but never stop loving their kids. But how is that profound or new?

2 April 2023,Chaotic and Annoying,"I found Everything Everywhere All At Once to be a very ambitious but ultimately disappointing film. The concept is certainly original, and the film is full of creativity and visual flair. However, the story is very convoluted and at times, annoying, and the characters are not very likable. I also found the film to be very long and self-indulgent.

Overall, I would give Everything Everywhere All At Once a 3/10. It is a film that is worth watching for its originality and creativity, but it is not a film that I would recommend to everyone.

Not sure how it's received rave reviews, and I certainly don't think it worthy of an Oscar.

30 March 2023,"Absolute rubbish, don't waste your time!","I watched most of this film, before finally giving up the hope that it might somehow improve, it didn't! It was just a ridiculous meandering load if nothingness! How this film won 7 Oscar's is totally beyond me. There must have been at least hundreds of far better films made in 2022 who were far more worthy of such awards. The film bears a slight resemblance to the Matrix, in that what appears to be real, isn't. However thats where the similarity ends. Some of the acting was reasonable, but the storyline was meaningless dribble, backed up by Jackie Chan like martial arts fighting that had little or no point. If you have 2+ hours to spare, I suggest that you watch some paint dry, it will be a far better option!

18 May 2022,Most unoriginal film ever made.,"Dreadful. Absolutely tedious dull nonsense. Everything everywhere all at once sucks in this film (pun intended). Really, everything about it is awful. At first, it's way too fast-paced that it's difficult to follow the events, yet later it gets way too slow-paced that it just gets so boring. The acting is terrible, none of the performances looks realistic nor does any of the characters believable. Actually, I hated all the characters, they're so uninspired and bland. Most of the film it's just so stressful and messed up that it's just beyond annoying. The film is full of immature childish humour that is so lame.

But the worst of all is that this film doesn't have any kind of originality at all. We got so many multiverse and meta films at this point already and this seems to be the most generic of them all. None of the other universes plays an important role in the film and there are so few, to begin with. The structure of the film is just like any kind of generic blockbuster following the same 20 rules of the generic ""The Hero's Journey"" film. It's full of cliches and doesn't bring anything new to the table, possibly one of the weakest screenplays I have ever seen. It overexplains everything and is repetitive to its core in doing the same events over and over again. Mindless fights and brainless arcs. The messages are so basic and dated that we learned them all 50 years ago in much more complex and subtle ways already, how does this film even dare to be so bare-bones in its execution, I cannot even imagine. Completely empty dumb trainwreck.",1
3 April 2023,Too much of the Surreal for me,"Sorry, AMPAS. This movie is too wierd for me. Sort of like a Dali or Pollock painting. So much doesnt makes any sense. Obviously this is intended, just much too much. The starting poiint is fairly normal, but it gets progressively incomprehensible with characters working out their conflicts in bizarre ways. These are sandwiched between occasional scenes with affection and words. Mid-movie is dominated by multiple representations of each character and the story becomes overly complicated with the multiverse. The use of butt plugs is over-the-top weird, even in a porno film. Alot of kung fu for action - this violence wears thin after about an hour. Hot dog fingers, a bagel religon, Chef with a raccoon on his head? Apparently some of it intended as a satire on Chinese families, supernatural, and kung fu. It is unique, but that doesn't make it entertaining or insightful. I am okay with two rocks talking with each other in a barren landscape, but a film mostly devoted to making things in overly complicated and impossible to understand much of the time - no thanks.

15 March 2023,The Emperor has no clothes,"How this movie got even near an Oscar nomination beats me. It's a confusing and pointless salad of ideas and images just thrown together. The acting which won awards seems wooden and second rate - although since the whole human situation is totally unintelligible it's hard to really say what they should be feeling and how they should be behaving. You certainly don't care what happens to anyone - there's no one to believe in sufficiently. Emotional moments fall flat as do attempts at humour which come over as in jokes. On the plus side, some of the imagery is interesting. But I guess it's fooled a lot of people. Overall it'll be forgotten in weeks and history will remember it as a B movie which mysteriously trended.

Petty I know.

But when I finally got around to watching it, I had such high expectations, and then they were crushed. Hard. I also previously watched the Oscars and I don't believe that they deserved everyone that they won.

Was it entertaining? Yes. Was it funny at times? Yes. Was it weird and random? Yes. Will I probably watch it ever again? No.

It does have a sweet message about always choosing your loved ones over any other opportunity in the world, which I think is sweet. And Ke Huy Quan nailed his part and I think 1000% deserved his Oscar.

Other than that, to me, there is no other reason to watch this movie. I will give it 3/5 stars, and probably recommend it to no one.",5

Watched it because user reviews we're always an indicator of a good movie, but this one broke the system. User reviews are no longer to be trusted. You owe me two hours ""reviewers"".

It's like watching Jackie Chan movies, but hyped up to the point of exhaustion. I don't know how this movie could have won an Oscar at all except possibly for special effects. But the Oscar award is of dubious quality anyway, as is, for example, the Eurosong in the world of music. This large number of won Oscars might have been intended to flatter the Chinese population (we know that films featuring oppressed minorities, disabled people, sensitive groups of all profiles are preferred at the Oscars...). But who knows, maybe the other 99 minutes of movie surpassed even classics like Citizen Kane, Apocalypse Now, The Godfather, Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, The Last Emperor...

The other half took a basic family conflict theme and over-inflated the story so it became permanent victim-status silliness. Vague trite platitudinal dialogue made me so bored. When the first third of the movie ended i was hoping that was the whole move but no, there were two more parts to slog through. I am glad i only spent $5 on my ticket and i don't think this is even something you'd want to rent or watch on tv for free some day. Avoid.

This is the movie that Hollywood is latching on to because they are really so tired of seeing MCU films over and over again and Scream 92 that a mess of a film seems unique. It reminds me of the Terry Gilliam movies of old that were critically acclaimed but unwatchable. There is nothing of any substance in this movie that is worth watching. Michelle Yeoh is nominated for an Oscar in a movie in which she doesn't even really act. She stands there exhausted while the chaos of the scene surrounds her. Last night I also watched Women Talking and was amazed at how unsung that movie is right now. EEAAO will probably win but in a few months the people who thought it was so great will be asking what the hell were they thinking.

I really didn't care for the characters, and I figured out pretty quickly that I didn't care what was happening to the lead actor; thus, my wife and I agreed we needed to find something else to watch. Can't figure out why this was a best picture nominee: perhaps it's because The Academy now nominates more that just five motion pictures each year. As a result, they dig deeper in the barrel and dredge out a few iffy choices. This definitely is one of those.

19 March 2023,Michelle Yeoh's worst movie.,"This film is poor in every respect. The script, the direction, the pace, the story, the effects and yes, even the acting. It can only be the product of hyping as it is so bad. It makes The Samaritan look like a good movie, that's how terrible it is. Imagine getting two greats such as Michelle Yeoh and Jamie lee Curtis and putting them in a stupid and juvenile school play that gets made up as it goes along. I would give this waste of time zero stars if I could. Read the other reviews before you subject yourself to this idiotic marketing manipulation otherwise you risk feeling embarrassed for having sat through it.

1 April 2023,"Nonsense, but not in a good way","What a load of tedious rubbish. A ridiculous film with a stupid plot that made no sense.

I had heard it was bad, but thought, given all the Oscars, it must have something going for it. Looking at what it won, I'll agree with the editing award and Jamie Lee Curtis's supporting actress award (although Shephanie Hsu was also very deserving). But best film? Definitely not. Best director? Not so much. Best actor for Michelle Yeoh (who I really like, but she's been in far better films than this)? Best supporting actor for Ke Huy Quan? No, sorry, I don't get it at all, it was just a solid performance, nothing outstanding.

All Quiet on the Western Front was, in pretty much every way, a far superior film. Plus, it made sense.

So anyway, I started watching it and was vaguely intrigued. But then it got stupid and I soon lost interest, eventually willing it to finish. Yes, some of the fight sequences were quite good, I suppose, but given that none of the characters was believable, I didn't really care about the outcome. In the end, it was like, oh no, not another fight sequence; I'm just not interested anymore.

I accept a lot of effort clearly went into the film, but it is, I fear, misplaced effort. The costumes and props were comical, but again, not in a good way, and not in a way that made the film more believable or endearing. And the bagel and the hot dogs... What were they about?! Were they supposed to be funny? Stupid is not the same as funny.",2
22 February 2023,Lost The Will To Live After 30 mins!,"I really can't see what the hype is all about. And neither could the BAFTAS voters apparently. It remains to be see what The Oscars will bring...... Definitely style over substance, I really did try to like it but frankly I thought it was a mess, it wore me out, constantly jumping back and forth, and yes I know that's what the plot was all about but really?

There are SO many better movies, & as for Michelle Yeoh's nomination for best actress? Nominate Olivia Colman for Empire of Light, now that is a phenominal movie! Jamie Lee Curtis was miscast in my opinion but what do I know? Just proves what poor judges much of the cinema going public are!

2 February 2023,One of the worst highly rated movies I've ever seen,"The first 10 minutes set the scene with relatively unintelligible dialog, no clues as to plot, and uninspired scenery and cinematography. The plot, when it eventually appears, vaguely, about halfway through the movie, is weird, even for this die hard sci fi fan. The frenetic scenes, poor dialogs, unrelatable characters, truly ho hum cinematography and costumes and makeup and sounds, made this unbearable to watch. I watched 2/3 and then fell asleep. Only potential positive for me was lead actress acting but that was overwhelmed by the film. To be so highly rated I guess this movie contains some technical aspects that professional reviewers appreciated but to me as a viewer, the plot, dialog, costuming, scenery, and characters made it very unentertaining.

15 March 2023,This won how many awards?,"This movie is beyond bizarre and not in the intriguing, worth-your-time sort of bizarre way. From early on all the way to the ending it's confusing as can be and I'm convinced no one really knows what's going on, including the writers themselves. The scenes are all over the place, starting with a heavy sense of seriousness only turning into one of the most ridiculous, over-the-top and obnoxious films I've ever seen. Comedy film, you say? What's that? Because this isn't it. The amount of twists and turns this film takes of highly unpredictable scenes in the most underwhelming and uninteresting (but loud) way possible is almost annoying. If a movie was ""try-hard"" - this would be it.

24 April 2023,In what world is this a good movie?,"The rave reviews, the Oscars... There are surely more meaningful and thought-provoking movies that were made in 2022, were there not?

The movie is an incomprehensible jumble of martial arts stunts and random special effects, severely lacking a storyline (because the action always jumps laterally, and that's intentional) or meaning. For those patient enough to sit through the first (excruciatingly senseless) one hour and 45 minutes, some meaning may start to emerge. I almost didn't make the cut to be in that group, I almost bailed out at the one hour mark (that's how much I normally give films to start becoming interesting or meaningful). But being an Oscar winning film, I made an exception.

After the senseless setup, most of which should have ended up on the edit room floor, a message starts to emerge. The message is pretty trite and far from revolutionary. The movie does take the crown in one category in my opinion, that of ""the most disappointing movie of the year"". Especially when considering the hype to value ratio. Very disappointing.",3
14 May 2022,Crazy but not in a good way,"Yes, this movie is really crazy. It's like nothing I have ever seen. But it is crazy in a bad way, so I'm really surprised that it has such high rating and good reviews.

First 30 minutes are quite interesting. Together with the main character we learn what is happening. I like that. I like when ordinary people are show in extraordinary circumstances. But that's it. Those extraordinary events quickly become annoying and watching that becomes tiresome. Movie is to long and repetitive. There also some cringe jokes like big d-s used to smack someone or b-plugs used to induce superpowers. College humour. Movie tries to pass some family values, but doing this in such crazy way didn't work for me at all.

27 May 2022,Rotten ideas,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

18 May 2022,original? not really,"I think people who LOVE this either hav'nt seen much scifi or are being paid to make fake reviews. The whole multiverse idea has been around a long time, sliders in the 90's , fringe, many other shows. I found it too much, the first 50 mins were good, but after thats its just messy and trying too hard, that scene with joy beating up the cops, was really badly made , cringe, I will remember as an example of how to make a bad film

I was glad of one thing , seeing an older Short round from indiana jones 2 ! I knew it was him from the eyes !

I cant really recommend it, messy , as was the trailer.

19 March 2023,Terrible movie!!!,"I've rated 3,744 movies as I write this review and have to state that my wife and I agree this is one of the worst movies we have ever seen. It is a jumble of disjointed scenes with no logical focal point. Granted, there may be a specialty audience for fantasy however we are baffled at the number of nominations and awards granted by the Academy of Motion Pictures. The acting in some of the other nominated movies was considerably superior. Very disappointed in the Academy's selection and reinforces my belief that the Academy can no longer be relied upon as a barometer of great or even mediocre movies.

28 December 2022,"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should","The underlying message in this film is great; that no matter what choices you make or what path you choose in life, all that matters is love, hope, and kindness. But the execution of that message in EEAAO was chaotic, violent, and just plain painful to watch. Imagine being in a well-stocked kitchen preparing a huge pot of everything in the pantry and fridge. Everything. Just open every damn can, jar, bottle, carton, package, spice, and dump it all in the pot; flavors you like, and flavors that you find horribly distasteful. Dinner guests would likely find the concept unique, but would not likely find the dish itself palatable. That is my take in this film. Far too much for far too long. The 3 stars are for acting, otherwise I'd give this a very reluctant 1 star (only because I can't give zero).

3 July 2023,Political correctness awards non deserving film,"If those in power want to reward Chinese Asians for their work, it should have been done decades ago with Last Emperor John Lone & Joan Chen leads, all Asian actors were 100% ignored in that film, O'toole got an Oscar after decades off films & near death. Other Asian films that we're deserving but ignored by Hollywood: Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, its entire cast plus Director Ang Lee; Curse of the Golden flower, Gong Li, Chow Yun Fat & Director; Hero, Jet Li, Donny Yen & entire cast, Director, Visual effects, etc.; Memoirs of Geisha, all cast & directing; House of Flying Daggers Zhi, 2 male leads, stunning cinematography, stunts, costumes, directing, etc.

FYI The Chinese little kid ""Shorty Round"" Harrison Ford's charismatic sidekick in Indiana Jones Temple of Doom is in THIS disastrous film as an adult.

This ridiculous film of nothing, dizzying everywhere, WTH is this? Is nonsensical & boring. Michelle Yoeh is showing her age after generations of being on film. She should've been rewarded for her past achievements, many of them ground breaking, esp in USA.

So, instead the academy rewards her decades later for this silly film that's waste of time. Just like Crazy Rich Asians showed no semblance of real lives of wealthy Malaysian Chinese & how their trust fund heirs behave - insulting stereotyping of their top wealthy families & overall culture.

This film is same garbage & promotes same erroneous stereotypes Hollywood still sadly promotes in this ""woke"" era. Woke movement leaves American Asians out despite their input & donations. Here, just another failed no plot film with political belated awards given. Don't waste your time watching this truly nonsensical brain cell killing film.

Film is free on Prime for months, like all failed films. Worst, Disney has created 2 spin offs- "" American born Chinese"" which has Nil to do with westernized Chinese born Americans; & Tom Hiddleston's ""Loki"" show.",1
18 May 2022,"A great concept reduced to millennial angst, empty spectacle and Hallmark emotions","Really, there is very little going on here - the film starts with a fantastic high concept and likeable protagonists, but squanders this almost from the get-go. The film's multiverse is in practice just a set of gimmicks, and isn't used in any insightful or interesting way that informs the characters - the conflict between Evelyn and her daughter is banal in the extreme and there are no real thoughts here other than #BeKind and love each other. The film's hyperkineticism and forced wackiness is hiding the fact that there's basically no content here. And the character of the daughter is really underdeveloped, we know almost nothing about her - the film's central conflict would have worked way better if Joy had been more rounded and developed as a character.

14 March 2023,"All over the place, from start to finish","I don't know which was the most embarrassing - the google eyes or the rocks.

The whole thing felt like it had been been thrown together by a bunch of 17-year-olds enjoying their first few puffs, falling about laughing at their own genius and 'innovation' (let's *do* it!) without a grownup in the room to say 'hang on a sec chaps'.

Can anyone tell me what would have been lost from this movie if, say, the amount of time given over to CGI martial arts was cut by 90%. Anyone? Characterisation? Plot development? Emotional engagement? Anything?

And what was the point? What was the great message of this movie? That the choices we make set our lives on one path out of an infinite number of possibilities. Wow! Profound, dood. Anything else, after two hours and 20 minutes of my life? Er, no. That's yer lot mate.

How the hell did this hoover up acting oscars? No-one got a chance to act. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you can only have great acting in a great movie. Where, in this, did anyone get the chance? At what point in the movie was great acting required? To show....what? Love? Hate? Hurt? Resentment? Determination? What? When did any of the characters exhibit anything beyond mild bemusement or yet another display of CGI martial arts.

I am so old I believe that at its heart moviemaking is storytelling. This had no story. None at all. No beginning, no middle, no end. Nothing.

I suppose fans of this kind of 'innovation' might see the likes of me as like old school jazz aficionados faced with freeform and bebop and exciting rule breaking experimentations, and not getting it. That's their prerogative. But this isn't exciting innovation. This isn't freeform jazz. It's just noise; and it goes on for two hours 20 minutes.

In 10 years time - no, in five years time - nobody will remember this movie at all other than one of the all time 'years the academy really lost its mind'.

Nobody will watch it.

Nobody will archive it.

Nobody will reference it, and it will haunt nobody's dreams. I can barely remember anything about it now, and I only saw it last night.

Only a corrupt culture which has lost all confidence in itself could elevate this worthless, depthless, shapeless mess to any kind of position, hold it in any kind of regard. I've seen some off Academy decisions in my time, but nothing close to this.

Rubbish produced by over-indulged rank amateurs. Nul points. The Academy should hang its head in shame.",1
7 May 2023,Nothing Anywhere Ever,"The Academy Awards has lost its way. This movie was the last straw in giving any credence to their idea of best picture of the year. This movie was pointless, stupid, and worse than a complete waste of time. I am embarrassed that I hung in for the finish. Although I must say I was very happy to see the final words ""the end."" I am still numb from trying to figure out the point. I believe if this was a film student's first attempt at a movie the professor would kindly nudge him into a different career path. I would like to explain what this movie is all about but I have absolutely no idea. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this film.

3 July 2022,Great potential and Great failure.,"Pros:
You will never see another movie like this.


Insanely creative imaginative complex beautiful
visually stunning
Mind opening scientific ideas
Great Acting
Great Directing


Cons:


What do I mean? The audience is left shorthanded in the end behind every great scene, every great sci-fi idea, every great action, the answer to ""why is this happening?"" is always insubstantial and frankly dumb.

If I could sum up this movie in one metaphorical sentence: It's like buying a five star restaurant then finding out it's filled with incompetent garbage chefs. So does that really make the restaurant five star or garbage? Isn't a restaurant as good as its chefs? Just like isn't a movie as good as its message? Hence my rating.

If I could sum up this movie in one literal sentence it would be: Asserting the idea that the infinite Cosmos, and infinite possibility of our existence, all of life and all of the Creation, all the time effort energy matter was all made for the sole purpose of advancing the United State's leftist political agenda. (And no I am not left nor right nor even an american nor do I take any solid position in anything. I'm just a human observer watching a movie. Resist the urge ti put me in a box lol)

I mean the literal quote they use in the ending of the movie and throughout is ""nothing matters"". It's as if they are only looking at the chaotic part of all Creation but forgetting to also see the orderly part of all Creation. I mean creation is both chaotic and orderly at the same time. And saying things like ""Be kind especially when you don't know what's going on"". Well if you don't know what's going on then shouldn't you be neither kind nor mean. Your assuming kindness is always answered with kindness. That is equally as dumb as assuming unkindness is always answered in unkindness.

This movie wants to pretend it is being open minded when really it is just taking an extremist position just like any other boring bias movie. It had so much potential...that's what will disappoint you the most.",1
29 April 2023,They should have to pay you to watch this movie,"My wife and I went to this movie based on the numerous reviews which heaped mountains of praise on it. The movie was a dystopian nightmare. We have loved Michelle Yeoh in almost every movie we have seen her in, but her prodigious talents were wasted in a movie with a plot that could have been written by an articulate three year old. I think I read somewhere that a movie is supposed to have a plot or story line. The few amusing segments were not enough to make the movie worth sitting through. In my opinion people who sat through the entire travesty should not only receive a refund, but should have been paid for enduring the unbearable experience.

17 April 2022,simplistically ruined,"The mother and daughter characters had potential. But the writing was insurmountably bad. Worthy of a kids movie but attempted complex themes which it couldn't pull off. Do not recommend.

To be completely honest, I didn't see the last 20 minutes as we walked out. It just wasn't worth any more lost minutes of our lives. We chose the movie based on reviews but am dumbfounded that this movie has anything above a 6/10. Poor execution of a poorly written movie.

The physicist that consulted in this movie has admitted he wants science to be more entertaining than accurate. Let him be a writer but stop giving credence to these bad movies as anything but silly.

30 May 2022,"Inane movie, don't understand the hype","I came into the movie with high expectations, since I like most A24 movies and it had such great reviews. But I couldn't stand it. I'm not sure who the audience for this movie is, but it's definitely not me.

I should say that I can't stand any comic book or superhero movies, and I now see it relates to a multiverse which might be a superhero thing, so maybe that's it. I thought it was going to be an indie drama type of movie with some mild fantasy/superhero tie-ins, but it felt more like a children's comic book with constant mind numbing action scenes.

The movie was just full of ridiculous fantasy stuff that changed every minute. You couldn't even keep track of all the crazy things going on, which I didn't even care to try to keep track of once I realized how inane it all was. After about 20 minutes I could barely pay attention because it was all just so far fetched and unbelievable.

Sure there's some nice messages there about acceptance and living in the moment etc. But surely there's nicer ways to find these things out rather than the technicolor vom that was this movie.

What am I missing here? There are people earning oscars for this, it must be me right? It simply can't be that the whole system is corrupt can it?

27 April 2023,It's official. Marvel has ruined Hollywood.,"Do you know that famous Bender quote from Futurama? ""Oh yeah, well I'm gonna make my own theme park... with black jack... and hookers... in fact, forget the park"". Now remember what Scorsese said about Marvel movies and imagine A24 said the same thing when they saw MCU's success.

All the great Hollywood directors and actors all the way back to Christopher Reeve and Orson Welles warned us this would happen. For the better half of cinema's history we were warned that cynical unoriginal uninspired entertainment is gonna take over the business.

The Oscars were never about quality, everyone knows this. But an academy award winning film is often AT LEAST palatable.

The only thing this movie does well is choreography. Pacing is awful. Story is awful. Full of plot holes that I guess could be explained with the mother of all plot hole plugs - THE MULTIVERSE. Nowadays whenever a movie struggles to tie its own shoelaces, it's explained away with the multiverse. A24 was supposed to be an alternative to MCU, not a victim to it.

Acting isn't great either. The script is awful. The entire premise feels randomly generated by an AI and then the writers just slapped in some tumblr posts about rocks with googly eyes talking about the meaninglessness of life on a cliff. This is cynical and insulting. Nothing happens in this movie. Just a bunch of people beating each other up and then loving each other.

I carry a deep and ugly hatred in my heart for all the garbage that came out of the MCU, but at least they were somewhat original compared to this. Why should an innocent viewer be forced to inflict as serious a brain damage as to waste two and a half hours on this pointless is beyond me. I don't even know how I was forced to endure this torture.",1

18 March 2023,Must be a meme,"I feel like this film must have been generated by some sort of algorithmic AI optimized to generate meme content. Is it concerning that the most relatable scenes were the ones of the two anthropomorphized rocks overlooking a canyon?

I guess the film stood as a symbol of one of its key themes: that nothing seems to make sense anymore. I bet in 60 or 100 years, should we make it that far, people will look back with a mix of pity and utter confusion and wonder: how did this qualify as a work of art, let alone one that people lined up to see? Let alone one that was acclaimed by the Academy Awards?? Sort of like how we look back at Dadaism or something.

I don't think it's a stretch to say that all of the characters were quite sad and pathetic. I guess the message at the end was: be kind to each other, despite how confused we might all be. That's great, but I'm not sure why I needed to spend my Friday evening sitting through hours of middle-school antics to get there.

I won't give it a zero because it's not a terrible film, but it just feels bewildering and not in an enlightening way. Maybe it's how the robots will look at the people in the future: what are these weird and dumb humans doing? I don't know.

In any case, there is one thing with which I will take issue: the core thesis that as there are millions of alternate universes, in most of which we kill one another, and because life on this planet like the others is ultimately meaningless, we may as well at least enjoy our time here with one another and be mindful of the moment. Maybe that'll turn out to be true - who knows - but most likely it just reinforces quite a nihilist and dangerous attitude towards life. Yes, we should be good and nice - not as a coping strategy to get through a crappy life, but because our lives are precious and it's all we have.",5

I saw Michelle's interviews and was quite excited to watch this movie. But the moment I started watching it, I felt I was just trying to grab something that would make sense. The comedy sucks and it's very cheap. It's like I was watching a cartoon but at least cartoons make sense. This movie just tried very hard to be edgy and it is edgy but that's where it fails completely. It tries to drive the message of kindness but in a very weird. It's like going around your neck to hold your nose. I have no idea why it won the Oscars. Please save yourself from this pain in the brain.

The fact that the critics love it shows you that they are either on glue or in the pay of the movie studios. Either way they shouldn't be listened too. The fact that this abortion of a movie cleaned up at the oscars tells you everything you need to know about the state of the arts in general and film making in particular. People will look back at this period as some kind of strange joke. Previous best film and actor winners must be turning in their graves. Emperors new clothes.

23 May 2022,What kind of drugs...,"What kind of drugs does someone have to take to come up with this stuff? I wish they spent more time telling the story then dragging on the fighting, which went on for about an hour too long. I fell asleep after awhile, then woke up to realize that basically the same thing was still happening. So I fell back asleep. At one point in the middle of the movie, credits started playing which got me very excited thinking it was over and I was done having to watch it, but it was a trick. The movie dragged on for at least another hour. My friend liked it though, which I don't get at all.

18 May 2022,"Multiverse - An infinite number, but this number didn't do it for me...","It was good to go to the cinema to watch something that is NOT another superhero movie, but this one straddles somewhere in the parody/homage aisle in between genres.

The problem is though that this film was really not made for me I think but a different audience. The only good thing I liked about this movie was the ever wonderful Michell Yeoh, but the rest left me cold. It will definitely fit a certain audience with it's off-beat humour and multiple Easter eggs.

However, I just wanted something that would grip me, but it might endear itself more to a female audience. That's not to say there isn't enough in it to make males enjoy it too. It's just a bit overlong and you'll either go with the ride or just want to get off. It didn't really add anything new to the increasingly parodied multiverse idea (e.g. Family Guy has done it to death now), but who cares?

For some I'd take a read of the reviews before watching it. It will be one that will find a cult audience in the same way that other left-field movies (like Scott Pilgrim) have over the years. Just wasn't for me sadly.",2
7 April 2023,Was whoever made this on drugs?,"I found this was a bit too much for me. Too much jumping around and hard to keep up with what was supposed to be going on. It felt like whoever made this was high on drugs or perhaps it's more enjoyable to watch if you are high on drugs.

I don't really understand the hype about this particular film and why it won so many oscars. There were so many other better contenders!

On a positive note some of the themes are interesting and thought provoking but unfortunately the chaos of the whole movie put me off a bit. Perhaps if it had been slightly less random and chaotic I would have enjoyed it more.

21 April 2022,A great disappointment,"I like deep, strange, high quality movies, so I had expectations, but this one is really shallow. There is no consistent plot. It seems like a random martial art movie with addition of cheap humour.

No emotions, no dialogues, no interesting philosophy behind random insanity. Just a gimmick to get some attention. It was so boring that I left the theater before the end. I'm truly amazed that people like this movie.

24 March 2023,"A waste of my time, even on second thought","I don't usually write reviews, and even less often when it is so little that I think of a movie. I am making an exception here. The message (love, acceptance, etc.) that the makers of this movie were so intent on conveying is pretty much undermined by the clich√©s that I saw here giftwrapped. Nothing matters is a quote from the movie. And they're right. None of this. Not even this movie. And my opinion either. Yet I felt it necessary to voice my feelings.

The heroine having a miserable life with shortcomings everywhere, yet deciding not to have it any other way. Well, it is a bit implausible, ridiculous even, don't you think? The actors in the leading roles did an OK job here, hence my 2 star rating. As for the path the director has chosen with special respect to the sudden switches, CGI and all, I must say it has failed to raise, let alone maintain my interest in the movie. It has failed to induce in me genuine empathy towards the characters. I couldn't relate. It's very rare that I can't. It seems to me that the director and whoever gave it a green light have lost sight of what cinema is about. This movie is in a paralell universe trapped and overrated. I do not recommend it.",2
20 March 2023,"Boring, pointless, and massively overhyped movie.","I went to watch this movie expecting an interesting and quirky sci-fi movie. After all, it had won lots of Oscars, so it must be good, right?

What I got was a boring, confusing, and largely pointless mess.

And the ending seemed to suddenly jump tracks from one explanation of what was happening to a completely different one. It wasn't like it was a great twist like some movies have, it was more of a ""we tricked you, ha!"" change in direction.

I'm now questioning all the 9 and 10 star reviews here. Are they fake? Or are some of them from people that just want to ride the ""me too"" train because they don't want to admit they didn't like it and didn't understand it?

As for the Academy Awards, what are these people thinking? Clearly they can no longer be trusted to judge a movie based on what has appeal to the general public, rendering themselves redundant.",1
17 March 2023,The movie everyone pretends they liked,"I really wanted to like it, but sorry, I just can't.

First, the movie wants to be as original as possible but loses any depth on the way. It wants to be funny but the level of humor is so primitive and vulgar, it just makes you roll your eyes over and over. After they deliver a joke, they will make sure to explain and repeat it as many times as possible, because they're sure their audience is dumb.

I would've given a star for their makeup and costumes, but it's so artificial and out of place, it feels like the movie was too boring and they just robed a neerby drag queen store.

One star is for the main actress' performance and the second one is also for her performance, because there's nothing else in this movie.

26 March 2023,A disaster ......,"Should have stopped watching this mess after first 10 minutes but I watched to the boring meaningless end. I guess I waited for something of interest ... nope. Hoped to see a film worthy of Jamie Curtis ..... disappointing. I am a fan of time travel and sci-fi films this was awful.

Special effects were great but story was all over the place, no plot that could be followed. Film had a few moments of humor the martial arts choreographing was a disaster. Mostly contained about two hours of pointless, tasteless, plotless, disastrous idiocy.

Skip this for something better, glad I didn't see in a theater I would have walked out.

18 March 2023,Cinematic Chinese Water Torture,"Gave it two stars only because the acting was good, the special effects were impressive, and it had one or two funny moments. Otherwise, this incoherent, over-the-top, pretentious, and sloppily sentimental abortion would have shared space in my personal Hell with James Cameron's ""Titanic,"" as the worst cinematic experience I have ever endured. If for some reason you feel compelled to waste two hours of your life you will never get back, resist the temptation to watch this thing and hit yourself in the head with a hammer, instead. You'll get the same mind-numbing after-effect while being blissfully unconscious, rather than having to suffer through more than 2-hours of sheer dreck.

7 October 2022,Pretentious film with a confusing plot. Visual effects are peculiar and well made.,"I was very curious to watch this A24 movie. Over the course of the last few months I saw that ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" was praised a lot online. Unfortunately I was quite disappointed: aside from the peculiar visual effects and the compelling photography, the plot is almost non-existent. The story is confusing, the director tried to explain to the audience how the multiverses works in this narrative, but he failed to deliver a convincing exposure. By the end I wondered what was even the point of these almost two and a half hours that I dedicated to watching this mess. Some might say that there is a hidden message to this story, but I could not find it. There are a few genuinely funny scenes, but overall for me this was quite a tedious experience: this production is way too long for what it is and there are a lot of repetitive sequences that could be removed completely from the final cut. The cast did overall a good job, Stephanie Hsu and Michelle Yeoh were amazing in their acting, even though the characters they played were basically empty shells with little to no development.

Personally I think that this was a very ambitious project, but the production required more work on the writing and editing side. This production is way too complicated, it needed to be simplified in order to make the movie more digestible for the audience. A24 productions are a hit or miss, this is definitely a miss, but I appreciate the effort in trying to make a good sci-fi movie, having a more limited budget, compared to a Hollywood company.",5
9 June 2022,You can't trust IMDB ratings any more,"Imagine a bunch of really annoying characters living that very busy life where non stop random rubbish happens to them all the time, I mean people constantly try to talk to them, they need a ton of random stuff get done and it's never ending, then suddenly add a sci fi ""let's do a multiverse"" gimmick...The story is pretty boring, the realisation is pretty average, my only guess someone is testing a ratingbot on IMDB...

8 August 2023,Not so good as rumored,"Not what I personally expected and an unreasonably hyped movie.

If you tend to be a superficial and self-centred person who's seeking to enlarge his vision without too much effort, this is the type of movie you're looking for.

Sometimes it gets funny and sometimes tedious.

The nowadays tendency to bring out the multiverse concept in movies is getting a bit out of hand and this one looks ridiculus in this aspect.

Many concepts are not even explained and most of the time get enphasised with banal explanations.

Overall not so good and too long.

Objectively speaking, not an Oscar Movie as one would expect.",5
27 May 2022,Really not a hater at all,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

5 April 2023,"Juvenile, shallow and at times just plain disgusting","Playing along the lines of the Multiverse theme, we are obviously living in a universe where a movie as bad as Everything Everywhere All at Once can win 7 Oscars. So somewhere out there, there's a universe where this movie was a total box office flop. I must living in the wrong universe!

Seriously this is a rubbish movie. I cannot understand how anyone could rate this as the best movie ever. Poorly scripted, badly edited, and mindless drivel ... there were plot lines that went nowhere. Some scenes ran on forever and had little to do with the story line. How does an oversized burnt donut represent some form of deity?

Save your money and don't bother seeing this movie. You'll be doing yourself a big favour.

25 May 2022,"A shiny object underneath your car except, oh wait, its just aluminum foil.","Pretentious ham-fisted nonsense for shallow minded movie-goers. Physically painfully random yet somehow completely contrived. ""I'm 13 and this is deep"" the movie.

I have only walked out of one movie in my entire life and I was incredibly tempted to walk out of this one. I only stayed because I was with friends. It was excruciatingly long. Paper thin plot taped together with an absolute barrage of jump cuts and flashing images. Two hours felt like three and a half. Completely exasperating and I couldn't wait for it to be over.

Actors tried their best but ultimately they had such little to work with (as far as an actual script), everything was so random, and there was so little character development that by the end I had virtually zero investment and couldn't care less about any of them.

Save your money and time. This one is a polished turd presented as a diamond in the rough. Drivel for the mindless masses.",1
30 March 2023,So overhyped but what a waste,"I know it's a cliche, but seriously, that's over 2 hours of flashy crummy weirdness that I'll never get back. I think something is wrong with Hollywood when they try to sell us on such an oddball movie being worthy of winning awards.

I won't include any spoilers to ruin it for those brave enough to still give this one a shot. But I will say that it just fails to deliver on all of the hype that has followed this movie. I certainly followed the plot and all of the ensuing twists and turns. But it was just too high on the weird scale, and not enough grounding to make it truly enjoyable. My apologies to others who really loved this, but I just didn't get it, and I'd encourage anyone else considering this to just take a pass. Sorry.

9 April 2023,Unbelievable bad,"It is a very long time ago when I turned off a movie but this one is so boring, confusing and annoying that I couldn't bear it to the end. I am so irritated about the majority of positive reviews that I am urged to write my first one here. Yes the actors are doing quite a good job but the plot is so absurd that I cannot understand why people like this. The movie doesn't manage to create any suspense but awkward and stressful scenes. Unfortunately it is another example why Oscar winning movies often are brackish. I don't know if I ever gave just 1 star but in this case my dissapointment in combination with the weirdness of this artwork couldn' t have another result. What a torture!

28 February 2023,Craziest Plot Ever,"This movie's plot is the most insane and ludicrous thing ever. It makes absolutely no sense of any kind. It is trying to be like the Matrix and not succeeding at all. The multiverse concept has been done many times in Marvel so it's not new. I can't believe this movie got 11 Oscar nominations. The Academy will nominate any garbage movie nowadays. This movie is a stew of randomness that just makes me sick to my stomach. It is convoluted to the point of no return. I am getting really tired of Hollywood making trash and people looking at it like it's gold. I have a need for movies to make some sense even if it's fantasy or science fiction.

The film is so poor that even cannot bring a good martial arts not a good comedy and not even a mid level Sci-fi.

19 March 2023,Not for me...,"On Oscar night, I was excited to see who would win and listen to all the speeches. I was happy for the people that won. I would watch the movie later that won an Oscar for Best Picture.

Did this movie really win 7 Oscars? Wow! It started off with a good storyline, then it got distorted (literally).

I watched the movie after the Oscars. Now, I understand Angela Basset's face. At first, I was disappointed that she didn't clap or smile for the winner. Now, I get it. I would've still clapped and smile. Lol

I love Jamie Lee Curtis, Ke Huy Quan, and Michelle Yeoh. They deserved the Oscar for their performances over time in the industry.

If i could rate it with 0 i would unfortunately 1 is the minimum! There was so many better movies that could've won the oscars instead of THAT!

17 July 2022,I Really Tried To Like It,"Let me first start off by saying that I did not want to watch this movie. I saw the trailer, and it wasn't my thing, but I was outvoted so my family and I ended up watching it anyways. It was recommended to us from a friend who said that she and her daughter had watched it twice already. I don't know if we saw different movies, but I will definitely not be watching this again.

The acting wasn't bad. And the plot was definitely original, but poorly executed. I found myself completely lost within 10 minutes of starting it, and that never changed. They try to do so much without explaining any of it. I can see the idea, but I just did not understand this movie at all. It was all over the place, and I just kept checking the time to see how much was left, and that's not a sign of a good movie.

I tried to like it, to see what everyone else in the reviews was seeing, but I was so bored watching it and wanted to be doing anything else. The only reason we watched the whole thing through was because we spent money on it. So if you were considering renting this film but wanted to see the reviews first, if I were you, I wouldn't spend my time or my money on this film. Wish I had read the reviews before I rented it.",2
21 May 2022,"Too long, too forced","I love weird movies. But this movie is just ... ok. The 8.x rating makes no sense.. it's just an unnecessarily long mish mash of random things added in just for the sake of being weird and then finally a heart strings pull at the end. Sounds very much like the director's own movie 'Swiss Army Man' but with more of Radcliffe's corpses. Feels like movies like this were made because the creatives are tripping and is also obligated to deliver preachy themes and forced pandering.

I almost turned it off three times but was waiting for the reason why the Academy Awards said it was good but I guess I totally miss that part because it was like Bill and Ted meets Marvel Universe meets whatever other sick movie that they put stuff up their butts for fun. There were so many more better movies out there and I don't know why this one got all the awards, other then the fact that people don't know what a good movie is anymore. This is certainly not the best movie of the year. I would say it's one of the worst. The whale was 1000 better.

The first 15 mins was kinda funny to watch, after that it went downhill fast where this fiction was introduced. I turned it off after the scene in the elevator where Kongfu started, it was unbearable. The movie is soulless. I wonder if this was heavily campaigned for Oscar awards due to so many recent incidences. Sorry, Cate Blanchette's movie is more interesting.

I watched it for free on Peacok after the Oscar but I could not get myself to finish the movie because it was pretty bad. Unbearable.

18 March 2023,Garbage,"Utter rubbish nonsense all over the place. I don't get it, really I don't.

I saw it and I was hoping to see something interesting.

One of the main issues you had with the movie was its length, which was almost three hours. This is certainly a valid criticism, as long movies can be difficult to sit through, especially if the pacing is slow.

Another problem you had with the film was the action, which you felt was nonsensical. This is also a common complaint for action movies, as viewers often expect the action scenes to be exciting and well-choreographed.

Despite the presence of good actors, it seems like the movie was still unable to deliver a satisfying experience. The overall lack of coherence and boredom in the film left you disappointed and wishing you had spent your time elsewhere.

In summary, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" was a tedious and poorly executed movie that failed to captivate its audience. Its unnecessarily long runtime and nonsensical action scenes only added to its overall lack of appeal.",1
13 March 2023,"Great acting, weird story","This could have been really good. It has a cool concept and great acting but it was just too weird and borderline perverted at times. I'm not a prude but I have no interest in watching people with dildos and butt plugs fighting each other on screen. The hotdog hands were weird too. And it was also about 30 minutes too long. I was hitting pause to see how much time was left towards the end. Whoever wrote this has an odd sense of humor to say the least and that's being kind. Somehow this won all the awards though which should tell you something about the state of Hollywood now and probably also tells you something about why the Oscars are plummeting in ratings and interest. Maybe soon they'll make movies again that are inspiring and heroic instead of weird and perverse. Fingers crossed (not hotdog fingers)...

15 March 2023,"Oh dear, what a disappointment.","After seeing the number of Oscars this film won I was expecting something extraordinary. Sadly what we get here is just extraordinarily unsatisfying, overrated rubbish. Best actor? Seriously? Best film? Give me a break.

I almost never bother writing reviews, but when a film like this gets such a high approval rating I will always give it a try, and I feel compelled to submit this if only to add some balance to the people who seem to think massive amounts of (mostly digital) special effects, violence, quasi-scientific gobbledygook, tokenism and comic book fantasy make for an impressive film.

My advice? Give it a miss and watch Banshees of Inisherin if you want to see proper acting.

20 March 2023,Tries too hard,"So, the worst acting actors in this movie won an Oscar for Best Actor and Actress? The plot was the dumbest way to explain alternate universes. The movie thinks too highly of itself. They forced emotionality in scenes that make no sense.

The fact that it was even nominated, let alone winning ANYTHING, is mind-numbing, to say the least. Make no mistake, there is a big problem happening here. I don't know what it is, but something made this movie win the Oscar, and talent is not one of them.

14 March 2023,A mess of random events,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

1 April 2023,I rarely walkout of films but could not take any more!,"I think I've only ever walked out of three films in my life but after 2 hours of excruciating cinema I couldn't take anymore. My partner said after I suggested we leave .. 'Thank god for that!. I've been wishing we could leave an hour ago"".

The storyline was too daft for words. Not funny at all and just so repetitive scene after scene. Flipping from one alternative universe to another.

Despite the underlying complexity of the daft 'multi-universe' storyline is was entirely predictable where it was heading. Ie. Mother not understanding her daughter. Fix that and all will be right with every universe!. Please, pass the vomit bucket.

How in the hell did this win best picture!

3 December 2022,Buckles under the weight of its own creativity,"Everything Everywhere All at Once left me feeling simultaneously overwhelmed and underwhelmed. There's a lot to admire about this film. Its premise is original, the direction is very well done as is the editing, and the entire cast is genuinely great. When this film started, I thought I was going to love it, but as the movie went on I started to like it less and less. This movie feels like an art house film made for the Tik Tok generation. It's very random, overly chaotic, and absurdly fast-paced.

I can't help but feel that Everything Everywhere All at Once really buckles under the weight of its own creativity. It's a film that's trying to be a lot of different things. It wants to be an art film, a sci-fi film, a kung fu film, a comedy/absurdist film, and a family drama. I admire the ambition but it really began to feel like way too much after a while. The pacing is so breakneck that I literally began to get a headache, and it was hard for me to get emotionally attached to anything in the story because the movie was just throwing so much stuff at me constantly. It felt like the directors were trying way too hard just to show off.

I understood what this movie was trying to convey thematically. It's clearly a commentary on finding optimism in a nihilistic world, or in this case, worlds. I get it. But whatever genuine emotions this movie was trying to have, it all gets immediately undermined by nonstop visual gags, some of which were needlessly juvenile and all of which felt weird just for the sake of being weird. I think a great film to watch as a juxtaposition to this one is Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. That's a great example of a weird and highly original movie that doesn't have its depth or emotional weight undermined due to its staggering creativity.

I wanted to love this movie, really I did. And I understand why so many people do love it. It is different, there's no denying that, and who knows, perhaps during a rewatch I might feel differently but as of right now, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like an overhyped film that is far too chaotic for its own good.",5
29 May 2022,How did this get an 8.4?,"It's like they chopped a movie up like a pizza, picked one slice and played it over and over again for an hour longer than it needed to. Literally picked it for it's high rating and left shaking my head. After, my 12 year-old daughter turned to me and said: I didn't understand any of that.

16 April 2022,This movie is SO bad,"I don't even know where to start, or how to describe this movie. Multi-verse? A cross between The Matrix, Inception and Buckaroo Bonzai, though not NEARLY as good as any of those. Incredibly, irredeemably silly at times. Extremely difficult to follow at others.

Probably 6-8 couples at the theater viewing I attended. Two couples walked out. My wife left halfway through. I've never walked out of a movie, but this is as close as I've ever been. It is about two hours long, but I could have sworn I was in there for 3 1/2 hours. The people that made it through the entire flick were simply shaking their heads when it was over.

I am stunned at the composite rating for this movie, both here and on Rotten Tomatoes. It makes me question the reliability of both.

19 March 2023,I don't take an Oscar seriously anymore,"Does Hollywood mock the general public?

Were no good movies made that year at all?

Can marketing push any kind of useless scenario down our throats?

Well, at least the reviews don't seem to rigged if I see all the people that took the time to explain what a dissappointment this movie was.

An unoriginal, therefor not bad, idea that was worked out to long in endless plottwists and long scenes.

It seems like they let a couple of teenagers without any critical advice write this movie.

A pity for the cast, because some actors did an excellent job.

But good acting can clearly not right a wrong scenario..",3

9 March 2023,An incoherent mess of a film,"This is my first review for IMDB. I've never felt the urge to write one before, but for this movie, I needed to. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life, and believe me, I've seen hundreds of bad movies before. The film centres around a woman who must connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a powerful being from destroying the multiverse. That's basically the whole premise. The bulk of the film focuses on visiting multiverses that are just plain bizarre, including a world where everyone has hot-dog hands. There are many absurd moments in the film that are cringe-inducing and not funny to watch, like two men trying to insert objects into their butts and a man getting spanked in some weird BDSM-style world. The movie keeps switching between multiverses and becomes extremely hard to follow. The editing is just awful. The message of the movie basically boils down to the importance of family and accepting others. That would be fine if they didn't shoe horn all the multiverse baloney into the movie. The way the message of family is delivered falls flat. By the end of the movie, I ended up not caring for the characters. WIthout spoiling the movie, the ""sense of threat"" in the movie ends up having no impact on the movie. The movie takes ideas from films like The Matrix, but the sense of progression for the ""hero's journey"" is badly written. Characters suddenly do things in the film with no prior development. The pacing is just bad. None of the multiverse moments are interesting or funny to watch. The action scenes are badly choreographed too. Michelle Yeoh is an actress whose work I have loved in the past. In films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Supercop, and Tomorrow Never DIes, she proves that she can perform in great action scenes. Unfortunately, this movie wastes that potential. Yeoh's performance in the film is fine, but it is not Oscar-worthy material, especially compared to the great Cate Blanchett in Tar. The same thing applies to Ke Huy Quan. Although he was my favourite part of the movie, his performance is nowhere as great as Brandon Gleeson or Barry Keoghan in The Banshees of Inisherin. Stephanie Hsu's character is painfully annoying in the film. She comes off as arrogant and rude, even though she plays a crucial role in the story and the movie wants us to sympathize with her. Jamie Lee Curtis, an actress I've loved in the classic Halloween and True Lies, is almost non-existent in the film. Her character only appears for a handful of moments, none of which are especially memorable. I do not understand what is so great about her or Hsu's performance that warrants a Best Supporting Actress nomination.

Overall, this is not just an overrated movie, but an awful one too. By far the worst movie to ever be nominated for an Oscar. In a year with great films like Tar, The Banshees of Inisherin, All Quiet on The Western Front, and even Avatar: The Way of Water, it's shocking to see that this film is the Oscar frontrunner. The fact that it is nominated with as many Oscars as The Return of the King and Titanic is laughable. To those putting this in their top 5 of all time, you really need to watch more films.",1
13 July 2023,5/10. One of the most overrated movies of all time,"It's not difficult to understand why this movie is overrated as hell. Of course every movie critic would praise it and everyone knows the reason why.

I don't mind this movie's theme. Acceptance is this movie's theme and every person needs to feel it, every person needs to be accepted from his/her parents and friends and the society, in general. Especially when this person didn't do anything wrong. However, to be honest, it is not my favorite theme. If i knew what this movie is about, i wouldn't have watched it. I didn't connect with the characters here. I didn't care about their issues.

Philosophically speaking, I don't crave for acceptance. Only ourselves can grant us this thing. If we are ok with ourselves, we don't care about everyone's opinion. The need for acceptance is lowkey dangerous.

It's not only the theme. I mean, i liked a lot movies like MILK (2008), FLAWLESS (1999) etc. If this movie was well directed and had a good story, i would have appreciated it. Not the case here. This is a total mess. Chaotic, tiring, unstructured. And excessively long. It had five or six endings, my mind got numb. At the ending, i had stopped caring about everyone. These were somewhat likeable characters but during the last 20 minutes, i didn't care about what happened to them. Dead, alive, happy, sad, just please end it, i don't care.

I didn't like also the idea that ""people are worthless pieces of .."". This movie tells us that there is not a meaning, that people mean nothing, that our actions have no consequences because, multiverse. This movie is way more nihilistic and devious than it seems. I am sorry that some people feel this way. But some of us still believe in something. Some of us believe in God. Some of us believe in an ideology. Some of us are reading books, philosophy, poetry, literatture.

There is something wrong about this movie.",5
21 May 2022,I can't... I mean... I don't even...,"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"", rated 8.6 (that's higher than Infinity War and Endgame) on IMDB.

Yet for me this was one of the most boring and lamest movies I've watched of all time. Certainly the silliest movie I've watched this decade. Impossible to take seriously and I imagine the high rating is due to all the emotional nonsense that's mostly near the end of the movie.

It was putting me to sleep halfway through and I felt exhausted after I finished it. I would take Morbius and Batman over this.

1/10, waste of time, will not elaborate further. Screw this movie.

27 January 2023,Dreadful Acid Trip Plot Offsets the Great Acting,"The first time I attempted to watch the movie, I spent 45 minutes on it and gave up. A month later after all of the buzz and Oscar nominations I forced myself to stick with it to the end just to see if I was missing something. I wasn't, although Michelle Yeoh's acting is so good that there is a nice resolution for her at the end.

I admire creativity as much as the next movie fan, but this one is so over the top it looks as if the writers/directors were on an acid trip trying to insert a bunch of dream sequences. I suspect there is going to be a big backlash if it wins Best Picture. Yes, Michelle Yeoh deserves Best Actress, but the picture is not worthy.

13 June 2022,Mess Up,"It's very long, and it's not an exaggeration to describe it as sitting on pins and needles. All the characters except Michelle Yeoh have no acting skills. The plot is messy. The American chicken soup is late but it arrives. When you enter the scene with your brain, no one will give you any room to think. Lie down. Just be indoctrinated. Is this the future of cinema?

26 March 2023,Dull,"There is definitely an element of popularity in the film, through viewers keen to not come across as not understanding it and as with multiple examples before this, with unique arty films, publicly praising it makes you feel a better and more intelligent within yourself.

This was another such example. In one way, it is impossible to follow, you need 5-6 viewings before you would even start to pick up everything that is going on. But then on the contrary, becausw of that and the overall premise being fairly straightforward it also makes it quite easy to broadly follow, in that you are not required to 'get' every aspect of it.

The bigger problems with it, were parts of it were just ridiculous. Sausages for dings, fighting with dildos. It just seemed like a first draft of a film before a few more revisions.

The producers also needed to excerise the ""less is more"" philosophy. It just dragged on and on, like a concert, with the singer coming back on stage. It could have ended threw times in the 30 minutes before it did, without losing anything.",4

17 April 2023,"ANYTHING, ANYWHERE, just not with this üí©","That is, Chinese sad layer, watered with leftist sauce. By the way, it's funny that the Jackie Chan movies from the 70s/80s of the twentieth century presented better fight choreography, and here, despite the latest special effects, it looks as if the actors were afraid that they would not get a button. I didn't know the ending and I'm not interested. Such unglued films used to go to independent, niche competitions. They had their enthusiasts, press and after party. Moving it to the Oscars competition and showering with 7 statuettes is a mockery of people working for decades for recognition in the film world.

19 July 2023,Overhyped,"Its just a family drama and not even very deep one, and not a very good one. Family drama is on the level of average tv series... Concept of multiverse portrayed very nice and gives you the glimpse of how it feels. But thats it, movie awfuly lacks in deepness.

Production is on level but costume design is awful. Goofy devices that let you jump through universes are looking ok-ish, but the headquarters of Joy with beagle and people in there looks awful. There is no creativeness in their costumes its ruining the vibe so hard, its unbearable.

Overall its a trippy family drama with cosmic twist about multiverse. Do not expect much from this movie.

16 March 2023,Terrible,"The worst multi Oscar winning movie of all time. Fell asleep watching it the first time, gave it another shot and only made it to 49 mins. This movie is what happens when there are outcries about inequality in Hollywood. This movie didn't deserve one award. It's painful to watch, and not artistic at all. The plot is all over the place, there are no scenes of comedy, everything is just done in such a way that it make the audience throw-up in their mouths just a little each scene. Curtis keeps making the same screams over and over that it makes one thing her brother is still out to get her. This was one of the worst movies made, the Academy Awards need to look in the mirror after this one, and think are they awarding talent and the best or just going along with certain groups who have questioned them.

Decided to force my way through the entire film as so many people have said how good it is but i genuinely had to look to see if there was a different film with the same name because this one was so bad. It's just constantly flickering from scene to scene, makes no sense, completely illogical. It's like watching a Chinese version of star trek or Dr Who but worse, if that's even possible. I don't know what everyone else thought was so good. A complete waste of 2 hours. I have absolutely no idea how it won Oscars, i can only imagine someone was paid a lot of money to get those awards for an absolutely rubbish film.

Just goes to show how much of a slide the film industry is in at the moment if this cleans up all the awards!! After watching so much good TV over the last 10/15 years it pains me say this is the year Hollywood has finally died!

25 March 2023,Go. Watch. Paint. Dry.,"Nothing nowhere anytime - Overhyped garbage.

Did the Academy actually watch it? Or did they just give out awards to the movie with the most confusing plot and least amount of coherence?

I don't even know what this movie was supposed to be about. Generational minority immigration happenings? Parallel universes? Time travel? Family drama? It's like they threw everything and the kitchen sink into this movie and hoped for the best. Newsflash: it didn't work.

The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that it would all come together in the end. Spoiler alert: it didn't. Instead, I was left feeling frustrated and confused. Oh wait - i'm sure that was the goal? Or wasn't it? Maybe?

You value your sanity and your time? Steer clear of this disaster. It's not worth the aggravation or the high blood pressure. If you're still looking for a way to kill time, watch paint dry instead. It'll be a more entertaining use of your time.

There are some moments within the movie that the actor's talents are allowed to shine but unfortunately they are never really provided with material that has any weight to it or material that means anything. I just found my self feeling indifferent to any of the characters problems or successes.

I don't really know who this film was made for, all I know is that I am clearly not the intended audience.",5
14 March 2023,Oscar Voters again let moviegoers down,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

13 March 2023,Ridiculous Oscar winner!!!!!!,"This won 7 Oscars!! Unbelievable! It's a complete mess of a movie! Very hard to watch! People who voted for this should be sacked! It really is a bad, annoying, horrible watch! Bad acting, awful story if you can call it a story! I lost interest after 15 minutes, please don't watch this rubbish and please definitely don't pay to watch it!

The Oscars are an embarrassment, so many more deserving movies which should have won and we have see this piece of garbage win!

Who at the Oscars are making these decisions? They really do need serious help!

BAD MOVIE, THE OSCARS COMMITTEE ARE INSANE!!!!!!!!

4 May 2022,Strangest film I've ever seen,"A friend and I saw this movie today. It's the 1st time I've rated a movie one star. The draw for me was 98-year-old James Hong, an actor whose career I've followed for over 50 years. We agreed that the script must have been written by someone on a bad acid trip. We were ecstatic when it was finally over, because we didn't understand it at all. I still enjoy watching James Hong, but whatever the message of this film is, we definitely missed it.

20 May 2022,Son of a Fish Called Wanda,"Last night, we were watching ""Everything Everywhere All at Once."" I had really, really, really been looking forward to this movie. But after an hour of crude jokes and endless ""kung-fu"" fighting, we had to stop.

The movie opens in a home/laundromat and soon moves to an IRS office. There, Evelyn slaps an auditor who promptly calls building security. Evelyn's husband severely disables the entire team. These days, my sympathies are with building security.

In order for a person to trigger a jump between ""universes,"" they need to perform a weird and unpredictable act, like shoving an small office trophy up their butt or saying, ""I love you,"" and meaning it. I love you? With still another hour to go, we never really got out of the IRS office. That was enough.

Maybe it was the presence of an unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis, but this movie reminded me of another comedy also celebrated for the cruelty of its humor: A Fish Called Wanda (1988). That movie sports an also inexplicable 7.5 IMDB rating. You could call this a ""Son of a Fish.""",1
14 March 2023,I watched this heap thinking its domination of the Oscars implied it would be worth the time and money.,"Over the same weekend of the Oscars, two banks failed. People think the bank failures could indicate more days ahead filled with comparable bad news and indications of corruption or poor managerial judgement. That symbolism is far easier to understand relative to this movie that any of its scenes. The Oscar awards this movie recieved tell me that Hollywood is in dire straights.

This movie is excruciating but I stuck it out thinking something was going to give it redemption. It never comes.

In trying to understand this lengthy mess, I am reminded that there are people who believe other countries are attempting to test the depths of Americans ability to be fooled in mass.

13 March 2023,Makes no sense at all,"The trailer looked interesting multiverse, fighting, good actors .. but the movie is just plain bad! Ok, a family drama set in a dry cleaning would have had no one interested, but ... the best scene is two rocks discussing the world - some might like the ""humor"", but for me it is just as if the author took LSD and was having a great time writing the script laughing at himself for his great visions ... Sorry, but the script of ""plan 9 from outer space"" is more worthy of an oscar!

One scene of another movie says it all: ""Billy Madison - Everyone is now dumber"" (check it on youtube ... it is a 100% match)

27 March 2023,Love it or hate it,"This is one of those films that you either love or hate, and ratings prove it. You will be either enchanted by it or have your intelligence insulted. I could not sit through 45 minutes of it. Wife fell asleep after 25. Call me ignorant and out of touch but I tried to like it, scouts honor, but simply could not connect to it. It is profusely arrogant in its narrative, disjointed and superficial. I did not understand the point of overzealous fight scenes and while it tries to ""blow your mind"" it simply comes across as smart as a fortune cookie. It invested so little in character development that I could not give a crap for any of them. It is completely beyond me that this drivel could have won so many Oscars that it did.

14 March 2023,A Crime Against Insanity,"This film is so bad it's funny. The sets and story, meaning behind the film, dialogue, action, acting, scenes are so terrible that I rate it 1 because I couldn't stop howling with laughter. Hollywood's finally done it, they've given all the Oscars to one of the worst films ever made. It's a shame with all these well made films this year, like Banshees of Inishirin, Tar, Babylon, Blonde, The Batman, All Quite On The Western Front, The Wonder. As Groucho Marx would say ''It's A Crime Against Insanity''. Believe me if the Marx Brothers were around today they would have so much material. I think Hollywood needs to sign the insanity clause. Maybe Santa Clause does actually exist.

29 January 2023,Awful,"Why the hype? Why the good reviews?

It was only because of so much positivity around it that I lasted 30 mins before eventually realising that I just don't get it and then I went away to do literally anything else instead.

For me personally, the 30 minutes I endured were noisy and meaningless and full of cliches from any number of Tarantino bubblegum movies, noting in my opinion that his movies are way better.

Maybe the movie improves after the first half an hour, maybe the story line starts to gain some clarity, but for me I was ready to quit after the first 10 minutes, staying with it for a bit longer to try to understand why people are loving it.

Oh well, my partner loved it, so whilst she enjoyed the rest of the film I want away to wash up the dinner dishes and then deep clean the kitchen.",1

17 July 2022,Unfortunate delivery,"Even though this movie is able to present very good acting through an outstanding production, it chose a very unfortunate way to deliver a message. A blend of all sorts of movie genres that did not end up smooth.

Unnecessarily long and at times confusing, it keeps trying too hard to push the envelope and ends up losing the audience. It did lose me, at least, totally unamused and confused with all the hype.

29 November 2022,Primitive Existential Crisis,"Without spoiling you, basically this is just another nihilistic movie about existential crisis that states the solution for finding a reason to don't suicide is loving your family and your partner therefore this movie disappointed me. If I had known this movie has a such point of view I wouldn't watch it. I only gave 5 out of 10 just because of its sense of humour, otherwise the movie is very empty uninteresting movie. I liked cinematography, the style of the movie and the acting in general but these had no effect on my score.

So, what if you cannot love anybody but yourself and you don't care about having a partner? That's why this movie is primitive because it assumes everyone cares about their biological programming. It's better to only love yourself and enjoy your life by enjoying yourself by being yourself no matter what. But according to this movie everyone would suicide when they don't have family and they don't have a partner which doesn't make sense.

In detail, it just didn't make sense when people start to have existential crisis just because they could travel between parallel universes. And it didn't make sense why they started to believe ""nothing matters"". It doesn't make sense because if you are such a person you would believe ""nothing matters"" when you living your only one life so how being aware of living in lots of parallel universes can make you believe ""nothing matters""? In real life people don't suicide because somehow they enjoy their life and they have no reason to suicide. It's not about what matters. It's all about they believe living life is better than suiciding even though they may believe ""nothing matters"".

I also think the idea of ""nothing matters"" depends on the context. For example when you have a husband and a child who loves and needs you, your life and therefore everything matters because you have to be part of the family so you have to judge everything in the context of if it will hurt your family or not. That's how family works. But for example for me it wouldn't matter to do something to save the human race because the human race doesn't matter to me. They will die anyway so what's the point? In that regard I think ""nothing about the human race matters"" as well as ""nothing about my life matters"" but I didn't have to be aware of my lives in parallel universes and I'm not suicidal. Carpe diem, bruh. No reason to be emo about it. But I think Nacho Cheese Doritos matters because it taste so good.

I think it was the right choice to make this movie have a decent sense of humor otherwise I would stop watching this movie after like 30 minutes because it was very boring but I stayed for the sense of humour. The Crazy random interesting sense of humour saved my day.",5

First 40 or 50 minutes was good but this then went somewhere that I cannot even explain, not in a good way.

I love MY, she is excellent and the kid from the Goonies (could not mistake his voice) was wonderful in his role but this was an experiment gone wrong in term of story.

Not sure why this is rated so highly, maybe like the joker, everyone was giving it 10's when it was like a 6 or 7....

23 March 2023,There must be a prank behind this!,"A scriptwriter, a producer and their close associates one day met in a in a BAR at downtown LA where they developed an idea of making a multi-dimensional film, involving science fiction, comedy, horror and you name it. Throw in in a celebrity or two, some ""Dr. WHO"" and ""Dumb and dumper"" flavours associated with idiotic multicultural characters and lots of color, and make a movie.

Just like a painting where you throw in all the colors in a bucket and spill it on a canvas and do nothing else.

Use some influencers to get some awards and voi la!

They rightfully anticipated that a lot of the people will say that the movie is worthless, but so what! Majority will talk highly of it because of the awards, artists and that the average person will go like ""oh, I think this is a complex art piece containing important messages for humanity"" pretending he understands art.

They must be loughing their asses off now! One of the biggest pranks in cinema industry.

BTW sorry folks, for my overrating as there was no zero or minus stars.",1
25 March 2023,Rubbish,"This is the worst film I have watched this year. It is beyond my understanding how it was even considered for an Oscar never mind win any!

When I say I watched it both my wife & I sat through 45 minutes looked at each other in disbelief then turned it off.

It started off reasonably well hence 1 star then who ever wrote the script must have been on some kind of medication. The fight scenes were yawning long and have been seen countless other times. Then the characters became more and more bizarre as if trying to make the audience react to such puerile so called humour.

Glad I didn't spend any money going to see such nonsense.

30 December 2022,Very disappointing,"I had high hopes for this film. I love Michelle Y. She is a brilliant and talented actor. However this film is a big let down. Her acting is excellent as usual. The plot is all over the place. It is random to the point of feeling like some sort of bizarre circus show from an alternative Universe.

I am completely baffled by the rating and can only concur that it's high because of the pretty high standard of visual effects and constant barrage of random action.

I Felt like I was eating 10 portions of sticky toffee pudding and needed to vomit by the end but I was to delirious to find a place to release the contents of my stomach and therefore had to hold it in. Not a great feeling!

This film had huge potential. The cast is great. It ended up feeling lazy and confusing. Maybe that was the intended effect? Maybe this is a film that is feeding into the random Instagram/Tik Tok scrolling generation?

For those with huge attention deficit this film might be a blessing.

Not for me I'm afraid. A big waste of talent.",5
2 October 2022,Every bad wierd movie all at once,"I've seen alot of wierd films. I was interested in giving this one ago whilst ignoring my better judgement. This is beyond wierd. Really daft and maybe a little bit woke. This film seems like it was written for school kids and tried waaay to hard to be funny. It was embarrissingly silly and stupid. One of the few films I would have quit after 20 minutes had I not been watching it with the missus (green lantern was the other). IMDb 8.1 rating!!!. I can only guess this is because the majority of the views don't watch much out of typical Hollywood movies and found it different (maybe I'm wrong). Imo it's possibly the worst film iv'e every seen. Next time I'll trust my judgement.

10 March 2023,Fresh in today - The Emperor's New Clothes,"What a total mess. Ask just one question, just one, and this whole film fall apart at the seams. I confidently estimate a ratio of holes 98%, plot 2%. There was an episode of Family Guy where Brian and Stewie venture across multiple universes. It was funny, clever, entertaining and believable. Yes, I know. A cartoon talking baby and dog in 25 minutes do the whole multiverse thing with panache. EEAAO is horrible. Frustrating and non-sensical. Some good acting - look at the rubbish they had to work with. Fight scenes were there to pad it out and added nothing. Just a dull reference to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, which was incidentally another ridiculously hyped film.

It's 2 1/4 hours of my life I won't get back.

I would refer my learned colleagues to the words of Public Enemy.

It has good moral lesson and the premise is good but execution is messed up... 4 stars for the production and acting. Messed up movie.

I guess it's one of those things where because everyone else is raving about it people are going along with the hype. Well that's not helping some poor souls who decide to watch this mess based on the reviews they're reading.

27 April 2023,I feel duped... Wow... so bad,"My first review in five years, but I feel duty bound to 'report' this shocker of a movie. I cannot comprehend how this film has garnered so much praise, let alone the fact it was voted 'Best Picture' by the Academy. I am sitting here trying to remember a worse picture I have seen, but nothing springs to mind. Overrated in every department. Acting so so, effects childish and overblown, plot utterly incoherent, no storyline. I checked the time remaining at least a dozen times, probably more. Coercion? Persuasion? Suggestion? How did so many people come to like this? I am truly baffled, reeling in shock.

26 March 2023,Terrible!,"An absolute mess of a movie with some SERIOUSLY overrated acting. How this thing has won so many Oscars and other awards, and such a high average mark on this site, is beyond belief. I have rarely seen such an incoherent mess with no redeeming features whatsoever garner so much undeserving praise. After managing three quarters of this pretentious tripe on a Saturday night I had to turn it off as I could feel the will to live physically draining from me, and decided to go for something far more visually and intellectually stimulating, and better acted too (even by the CGI!)...Godzilla v. Kong. Every award, at every ceremony everywhere, all at once, has been terminally damaged by supporting this tripe for one reason and one reason only that I can see!

16 March 2023,Academy got this wrong,"This film was extremely overrated and overly hyped. While the over all plot concludes to a well intentioned crescendo, the meat of the film contains nothing more than brash interpretations of a lucid, recreational drug induced state. The high jinx meshed into the film was a nauseating collision of Benny Hill meets Monty Python. With the fore-mentioned producing better quality. One would be better to view Bubba Hotep, than this film...and gain much more from it. Save your money, and watch when it is free and you are extremely bored. This film was about an hour too long. Sadly disappointed and the end couldn't come quick enough.

16 March 2023,What a piece of garbage,"I don't usually write reviews, but I have to stop others wasting their time. I lost 80 minutes of my life before switching it of.

I don't get the point of this movie. It has all been done before in some form. It also tries to be funny at some points, but just fails miserably. Characters are blend and stereotypical... The choreography of the fighting seens are okay, but nothing special there as well. It's like a 12 year old had a cool idea for a movie, it's all just so random and it just doesn't work.

Don't buy into the Oscar hype. This shouldn't have had any nominations at all. What a hot pile of garbage.

It's stupid, bad, and extremely childish. I can assume a 12 year old will like it though. It's not that I don't like movies with ""stranger"" themes, on the contrary. But what is this? Is it supposed to be a comedy? Slapstick? Children's adventures movie? It all looked very stupid and utterly brainless to me. The only time I think of I'll be able to watch it, is when I'm completely wasted and drunk. But as that happens like only once in a decade.... To be honest: it was sooo bad, that I'm furious it got so many Oscar's. I feel so sorry for the other nominees.

1 May 2022,Almost defies the rating system,"I used to make sure I watched the January Man each year on New Years' day. I took pride in liking the film so much when more than one film guide described it using words to the effect 'in the weird movie museum, this film has its own wing'. Everything Everywhere...has its own museum.

Ever been in a group on a project trying to come up with ideas and writing them all down to select the better ones? The writers did that without the selection part. They just used all of the ideas constantly throughout. To say the film lacks focus is to say Mozart wrote some music.

There is a false ending not far from the film's climax that could as easily have been the real thing. I remember watching 8 1/2 and falling asleep for 45 minutes. Never felt like the film made less sense. Everything Everywhere... is like that.

13 March 2023,Horrible,"I don't get it. My adult children told me that I had to see this movie. So one day we all sat down and streamed it on my home theater. I kept on saying to myself that this movie has to get better, it never did.

Who knows maybe it is generational. However, I am in my 50's and I am not a snob when it comes to movies. Just entertain me and give me some plot. This movie failed on both counts. The only thing I can think of was that the screenplay writer was on some LDS trip when writing this movie. Hot dog fingers? Really? I know this movie will get some attention due to the many awards it won at the Oscars. However, a classic movie like Gandhi or Gone With the Wind it is not.

19 March 2023,"I had to collect myself before reviewing this ""piece""","It's the day after viewing the movie and I deliberately wanted some time to pass before giving my opinion on it. Maybe I missed the point or was in a foul mood and it possibly deserves a second viewing. Maybe I'll read some of the other reviews and see if it influences what I saw. I've never dropped acid so I can't honestly tell if my opinion/assessment is valid but I have two comments to make with reference to this movie and drugs. First of all it's my belief that watching it under the influence of LSD would make little to no difference in the ""experience"" of witnessing what unfolds. And secondly is the Academy and/or people who thought this was good in any way....well are you people on crack? And I'm not exaggerating. In what universe would this be considered a major Oscar winning film? The plot I suppose could have been an intriguing concept to explore. However I was in utter disbelief this was an actual contender for best film and all the other catalogues that it won in. The acting...well there was none. The director after giving a vague idea of the plot could have just as easily said ""be crazy and stupid"" and we'll include it in the film. It was like a bad dream I would never wish to have. If one can't describe in reasonable detail what happens from scene to scene to scene to another person, something is wrong. Think about what I just said. Even with a photographic memory you couldn't. And you know why? Because there has to be some logic as an aid to help you remember. This was absent, TOTALLY absent. THIS THING WAS A JOKE.",1
20 June 2022,How does this have such high rating?,"Way too long. And lots of unnecessary, inappropriate scenes that add nothing to the story. Waste of 2.5 hours. Only reason it's not one star is good actors and acting.

21 June 2022,"Entertainment, not Cinema!","The movie poster was already explicit, but still, I gave it a chance because of the ratings.

The guy who wrote this movie is ""the best acid trip experience"" obviously never took LSD in his life!

It is just a mix a recent succesful productions like Stranger Things and some Marvel movies, spiced with Kung-Fu and woke culture.

Maybe the targeted audience was 12-16... Not sure.

13 March 2023,Am I crazy or what?,"I spent much of the day trying to determine whether I and the seeming minority of others who watched this film and despised it are just crazy or what. Multiverse? Hot dog fingers? A bagel that is a metaphor for life choices. Best Picture? OMG...is this what the motion picture industry champions as quality?

Where is Schindler's List, Quiz Show, The Godfather, Chariots of Fire, or even Arthur? What about Dances with Wolves, Shawshank Redemption, and Psycho? Shall I continue going back? Citizen Kane, Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, City Lights?

Undoubtedly, it's time for Asian Americans to get their due in Hollywood. But with this vehicle? I'M SO CONFUSED!

29 April 2023,A garbage movie,"I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie based upon what I saw from the various movie trailers but after it won Best Picture, I thought, maybe I'm missing some kind of gem. After seeing this movie in the theater, I have lost all respect for the Oscar's and the Oscar committee to choose the Best Picture based on quality. This movie was such a garbage movie that it's easy to tell the Oscar Committee is no longer interested in awarding Best Picture for the Best Picture but it's now all politically motivated.

I would love to read their notes on how, with all of the movies that were up for Best Picture, how did they finally choose this garbage movie as the movie that deserves such an honor of Best Picture.

12 March 2023,What a mess,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen! Totally overrated.

Endless martial arts fighting scenes without making sense. The story is so chaotic that it is nearly impossible to follow, at least for me. It is almost painful to watch, 2 hours and 19 minutes of torture. Don't waste your time in watching this movie. Until the end I hoped it would make sense, but it didn't.

The acting was very good, though. However, what happened to our universe if a movie like this gets 11 acadamy award nomination? I can't remember when my opinion so totally disagreed with the critics and other viewers. For me this is the most disturbing thing about it!

7 March 2023,The most overrated movie of all time,"Of all the bad copies of Rick and Morty that appeared recently, this one is by far the worst. It feels like an overlong saturday morning cartoon on cocaine, aimed at five year olds with ADHD. I've never seen a movie that felt so long and boring, while also being hectic and overexcited at the same time.

It remains a total mystery to me why this bunch of silly nonsense is praised by the whole wide world. I really would rather rewatch Titanic II than Everything Everywhere...oh, I should also mention that the title is a disaster in its own right.

If you want some good sci-fi-comedy, watch Back to the Future or Mars Attacks. If you want some headaches, watch this one.

13 March 2023,Hyper manic and unwatchable,"I was looking forward to this movie after hearing the premise but 20 minutes in my head was already hurting. 100 mile an hour dialogue, some subtitled some in English even within the same conversation, quick cuts, manic overacting by absolutely everyone. Interesting seeing Jamie Lee Curtis in a different sort of role but didn't last any longer than her first scene before deciding I could live a better life by putting a different movie on. Best thing about it was it was free on Prime so my 20 minute mistake only cost me my time. I feel very lucky to have dodged this bullet based on other reviews.

14 May 2023,"I wanted to like it, I really did but...plugs?","I'm a big fan of a lot of the actors in this movie so I was very excited to watch it. Honestly, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I guess Michelle Yeoh's character is visited her husband who teaches her how to move through varying universes, which she needs to do so in order to save...something I don't know exactly. I was good until sausage fingers and but plugs happened, then, not so much. There's an underlying theme about family dynamics which is displaced and disjointed. This movie could have stood on its own without the Syfy, kung foo, silliness going on and been only about the family dynamics which would have been better...for me anyway.

I have liked almost everything Jamie Lee Curtis has ever been in, except the last 2 Halloween Movies and this one. She seemed to be over doing it in parts, but that's less on her and more on the director, but somehow, I think it was meant to be that way.

There are a lot of inside jokes to this movie that I just don't get. Maybe it was a book, and the written story would have played out better in my head than this one did on film. Butt plugs? Really?

I didn't get it, I didn't like it, I ended up losing interest and going and making dinner instead of watching this. I really REALLY wanted to like is so badly and had heard great things about it, maybe I just didn't get the joke or I missed a critical piece that would have tied it all together, but I don't think so.

I do recommend watching this movie, if for no other reason, you get to see Ke Huy Quan, famous for the ""Goonies,"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of doom,"" in action again. Jamie Lee Curtis' character is almost funny, Michelle Yeoh carried the movie, and she really did a good job, she deserved an Oscar for holding up this movie. Also, I hadn't seen James Hong in anything in a while. The actors were ok, I just didn't get the whole thing, maybe you will.

Butt plugs? Really?",5
17 February 2023,Oh come on.,"Question. What is the hype around this movie? It is complete nonsense, quite badly made and we have a universe where everyone has hot dogs for fingers....

Some of the acting is cheap, the writing is cheap, the imagination of alternate universes is cheap, the 'message' of the movie is corny an cheap.

It is BAFFLING how this movie has been nominated for Oscars for any category, let alone best film. The Oscars and their credibility have sunk even further down the pan. It whiffs of token gestures. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence watching it and suggesting to them this is possibly the best movie of the last 12 months.

It tries to be funny, Jamie Lee Curtis's performance comes closest to achieving anything like comedic. The end. Even that storyline goes cringe in the end though.

I'll try and end on a positive and say I've sat through worse. That's the best I can do. Complete rubbish.",4
5 February 2023,The film's comedic relief was on the most immature level that it continuously conflicted with the more stable and rational parts of the film.,"If there was ever a film that I wanted so badly to see, and wanted so badly to walk away from within thirty minutes of watching, but tried to stick it out to the end with the expectation that it had to get better, only to be disappointed, it was this film.

Obviously, the main cast of the film was terrific and the directing of the film was incredible. Certainly, the acting was pretty good and the storyline was promising. These qualities gave this film the potential to be one of the greatest of all time, and yet it wasn't.

The film's comedic relief was on the most immature level that it continuously conflicted with the more stable and rational parts of the film. This made such an intelligent concept seem at times down right stupid, and I don't' like stupid films.

13 July 2022,Unbelievably overrated,"Storyline is not that good. It's confusing and chaotic. Pivoting around an (very) stereotypical Chinese family and their gay daughter. At the same time the movie doesn't care about their problems, divorce etc., but mostly a chaotic view to the ""pressures"" of life, (very very complex) relationships and family and the expectations from the children.

Then you'll have the right to ask am I getting old or is every movie nowadays written from a teenager's point of view to the life?

If you're somehow interested in the concept but expect a nice and meaningful movie, I strongly recommend Mr. Nobody. :)

25 April 2023,"I get the point, I don't get the treatment...","I'm happy for anyone on this planet (or Universe) who found depth, mystical salvation, soul liberation or just plain satisfaction from ""Everything, Everywhere All at Once"". As a detractor, I am in the minority (unless it's a silent majority?) but I won't address my category for there's no point in convincing 'myself'. My mind is broad enough to concede that the concept was innovative and even heartfelt... but Iet me tell the enlightened fans why I didn't like it.

It's not that I don't get ""it"" whatever ""it"" is, I have a problem with the stylistic treatment of a rather interesting idea. The exposition does a good job showing a Chinese immigrant lavatory-owner family struggling with financial and relationship crisis (doesn't everybody?) and as they try to fix a fiscal issue, Waymong, the husband (Key Huy Quan), tells his wife Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) that she can connect herself to an alternate universe where she leads a different life. As a fan of ""Butterfly Effect"" time travels, alternate scenarios or parallel universes √† la ""Matrix"", I was on the edge of my seat, ready to embark in one helluva ride.

The excitement didn't last.

The film gets quickly over-the-top with long choreographed fight scenes and characters acting weird before we would get used to their 'normal' selves. Jamie Lee Curtis starts as a colorful tax clerk but quickly turns into some Godzilla-Frankenstein-like creature making hard to take either part seriously. Evelyn is realistically reluctant to 'play the game' and manages to hold the viewers who need elements of empathy ... but once the stakes skyrocket to the level of universe destruction and many Sci-fi/Fantasy archetypes are thrown all over the place, I felt ejected to a live-action anime where anything can happen for the sake of visual shock.

Now, I love thought-challenging high-concept movies, but this one is simply overkilling it. I wouldn't recommend it to any seizure-prone individual for there's such an abundance of jump cuts and dizzying flashy images that I didn't get to my smartphone out of boredom but for relief. It might appeal to viewers accustomed with images popping all out of nowhere without any semblance of coherence. I won't deem the 'TikTok' generation but being fed with so much non sequitur flashiness might build a certain predisposition for embracing weirdness and reassembling a 5000 piece puzzle to get the 'deep' picture.

But maybe my idea of a 'multi-layered movie' is one that doesn't exceed three or four scenarios or subplots or where a certain linearity is maintained. Movies like ""Inception"", ""Run Lola Run"" or ""Butterfly Effect"" had a common thread nonetheless and even the awkward bits were properly overarched. Maybe there's a public who feels like no truth is sacred enough not to be deconstructed and that mayhem can be constructive. That's an interesting theory but I just don't think that narrative shouldn't be fluid, especially when everything else is.

I won't say the film has no depth but I wasn't put in a mood to dig into its creative soil and separate the good weird (talking rocks) from the bad (really, fingers as sausages?). I won't even say it's a cultural thing.

Indeed, ever since ""Parasite"", the Academy has been partial to Asian cinema with at least two or three major awards for an Asian production or artist. I'm no American, no Caucasian, and I applaud the way Asian visual mastery has conquered the field of entertainment (I just finished ""Beef"" and that statement also applies for TV productions). That said, I don't think the film should be the figurehead of a new form of entertainment that favors style at the expenses of basic storytelling and this comes from someone who loves Asian cinema. Kurosawa first toyed with narrative conventions and I would have loved to call this film a new ""Rashomon"".

Some also criticized the agenda. Well, I don't want to get into that turf because of the polemical undertones but let's not pretend the film is politically neutral... the advantage of having so many images popping out is that you can insert any 'Yvan eht Nioj' stuff in the process; when a troubled teen daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) hits security guards with a big dildo, turns a hunky mustachioed cop into Carmen Miranda or when a man gets spanked, BD-SM style, it doesn't take a Peterson or Shapiro mindset to find a certain stance against masculinity disguised as an ode for tolerance.

Now, I understand the film was a mainstream phenomenon that couldn't get unnoticed but so were many movies that didn't get a pass for the awards, despite their cult status. The Academy wanted to be in line with a certain hip mentality and award a foreign production... but why so many awards?

Reward editing or art-direction or even directing although it did a better job in misdirecting... but acting? The film doesn't challenge the notion of story but of roles. What's the point of rewarding a performance where one character can be so many at once, when you have countless vignettes, one for vulnerability, one for goofiness, one for badass fighting skills etc. Where is the merit of the actor compared to those who display versatility through one personality, character-development through one specific predicament?

There have been dual personalities or actors playing many characters at once, but the role-fluid button has been so pressed so hard I can't believe this film would forever be in the company of ""Network"" or ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" as three acting award winners.

Anyway, I could give a film 1 or 2 out of anger but I do understand the appeal. I tried to appreciate it, but I can't say it's superior or equal to most Best Picture winners, I'd give it a 5 for its technical inventiveness, daringness and catchy title... I won't call it one of the worst films ever but allow me one superlative: it's certainly one of the most frustrating.",5
15 March 2023,Surprised this won 7 categories in Oscars,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",1
18 June 2022,Overrated parody,"The movie had potential to go into a serious direction but instead it became a parody comedy with bad special effects. It looked liked a Youtube video from 2012 that imitates a music video. The randomness destroyed all the meaning in the plot.

15 March 2023,Utter Rubbish,"Based on the plotline, storytelling, screenplay and effects, Pinocchio would have been a much more worthy winner of the Oscar rather than this drivel. This has been all done before and much better in the Matrix and the MCU. The incoherent plot reminded me of Tenet..... remember that one! Sadly, I watched this film till the very end and yes, I was disappointed. The panel who voted for this at the Oscars must be living in LaLa Land (a much better film) - a classic case of ""The Kings New Clothes"" syndrome. I shan't be returning to this to see if I missed something - the experience would be too painful.

14 March 2023,Worst Best Picture Ever !,"A catchy title. Aside from that it's a complete mess.

I did like the cast but was very disappointed in what they were given to work with. I'm shocked that the Academy would select this film as the Best Picture of the year. Certainly it is not a crossover picture for all demographics. I would think that it primarily attracts a Gen Z audience. I thought that Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis were mostly wasted in their roles. I was happy for Ke Huy Kwan to get back into film but felt he was over the top in his role. The whole film is disjointed, jumbled and confusing.

I did think that some of the action scenes were visually striking but became somewhat repetitive as the film dragged on for over 2 hours.

One viewing was more than enough for me.

I hope the Academy redeems itself next year with a film worthy of Best Picture.",1

Oh how wrong I was. I have never been so utterly disappointed in a film as I was in this one. It was truly awful. I stuck it for around an hour before turning it off I just couldn't take any more. It was complete and utterly drivel and how anyone can rate this above one or two stars is completely beyond me. Not only was it drivel but it was boring beyond believe.

17 March 2023,"Nothing, Nowhere and Once is too Much","The best thing about this movie is two rocks on an alien planet falling off a cliff. I'm not kidding! While Hollywood congratulated itself with a bunch of Oscars, the rest of us are scratching our heads trying to figure out what producers were thinking. The film wanted to convey messages about family, love, hardship, duty, and regret. But all the preaching was lost in frantic scene shifting. Even the funny Hollywood veteran, Jamie Lee Curtis couldn't save this outer space shipwreck. Hollywood wants to be relevant and hip. But this two hours-plus waste of outer space is Nothing Nowhere and Once is Too Much.

17 May 2022,"In the minority, obviously, but I really found it bland.","Many films, most of them really, tell the same stories. It's just the approach, the style that differs (in some of them, even the style is the same). Daniel Scheinert and his filmmaking partner made it clear in their debut film, 'Swiss Army Man,' what kind of style they were going for: a quirky, absurdist style, and even though I didn't like it, I don't like it, I respected it for its newness. In this film, Daniel takes the story of 'The Matrix' and tells it in his fashion. He makes it seem fresh and original, but the bore I got from watching this was of Olympic proportions.

Dense! You think 'Tenet' was convoluted - buries that! But, if the things in 'Tenet' do start to make sense if you stop to think about them, here, I'm not sure they do. There's so much information coming from everywhere, suffocating you. The film takes you down and then starts beating you to a pulp. But I'm not sure. Maybe I couldn't keep up with it. The whole story felt like it had so many plot holes. Like, a lot of the stuff that happened didn't make any sense. It's weird because the film sells itself as a very grounded movie, regardless of the premise, which it isn't - I'm talking about the filmmakers' approach - but then it switches in the absurdist elements, and it just didn't feel like it all fit nicely. It didn't fit at all.

Most of the films that leave me convoluted also leave me with the urge to rewatch them, but this one doesn't. I didn't appreciate this film, and I don't think I'll ever touch it again. But, who knows? Maybe I'll find myself in the right circumstances - I'll lose a bet or a dare or something, else, there's no way - and I'll watch it again, love it, and think of how wrong I'm being right now. But as of now, as of this first watch, I think 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' is one of the most tedious and tasteless pieces of film I've come across recently. And, to think I've had some bland and distasteful film experiences lately.",5
13 March 2023,Everything about donation (not prizing) of an Oscar to Ugly images,"I should have saved my money not paying the ticket price for this movie and not to listen to pre-oscar predictions, nominations, sick-minded propagandas for sick minded producers of this garbage images; not even attributing it to movie or cinema as art or industry.

The film which is full of incoherent/ugly and mind disturbing images and noises is a terrible insult to viewers' intellects and their presumed capacity to distinguish good from bad, beauty from ugliness and good substance in story development and a garbage bin of ideas treated to become film. The theme and story is so messy and worthless that I do not have to write any more about it and also about those who donated an Oscar to it while disregarding artistic values & aesthetics. The contents, direction and ugly casting is evidently so low and downgraded that it is not worth to spend any more lines on this, let alone paying a single penny to watch.

24 June 2022,Too much too long all at once,"This movie shows many of the good and bad features of modern cinema. As you can see from the rating, the bad wins.

It is visually stunning, but too much all the time. You can't digest what you see. For something to stand out, it needs contrast: fast/slow, light/darkness, moving/still, and so on. And there is no contrast here.

It is action-packed, but again too much. The tension doesn't build up to explode, it is high all the time. But that is just not the way our brain works. You can't engage in a 2 hour long action scene, so you just disconnect every now and then.

The script has interesting and original concepts about philosophy, mother-daughter relations and life as a whole, but those are just drops in an ocean that is too overcrowded, and thus they don't create the impact they should.

It feels as if the whole movie were a plateau instead of a mountain (or a mountain range). It is high, but it is so flat it feels like a plain. So it becomes boring.

All of the above combined is utterly irritating, and makes the movie hard to watch.

On the other side, the cast is great, there are funny moments, and the whole concept of a middle aged wife as an action hero is brilliant. Maybe 45 minutes less would have helped?",3
20 July 2022,I literally woke up farting,"By the time the raccoon was revealed under the cook's toque as if it was a clever other-dimensional manifestation of Ratatouille's Remy, I had checked out of this movie so hard that I fell asleep and woke myself up with a fart. That's how bad this movie was. If that doesn't make sense don't worry, the rest of the movie won't either. I get the underlying ""what you focus your love and attention and compassion on will bear meaningful moments and relationships in your life"" storyline, but I've never seen it so painfully and sense-assaultingly portrayed in a movie. In that way, yes it's an original and unique movie. But in that and every other way, I literally hated it.

19 March 2023,Immature and Repetitive,"In each scene, the central character needs to summon super fighting powers to survive. The powers are summoned by doing something silly and immature (e.g. Elf inflicted paper cuts between fingers, or finding old bubble gum stuck under a table and using it to blow bubbles, etc.) This same repetition continues from scene to scene. Oddly staged fight scene after fight scene. The central character was also being attacked by her own daughter. Somehow she needed to save her daughter. After several scenes, I felt like I was watching paint dry. There was really nothing new that happened. Perhaps more entertaining for a 10 year old that enjoys goofy comedy.

It very hard to understand how this movie was able to get nominations and win awards.

4 September 2022,Hmmm,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

24 July 2022,Overrated cartoonish mess,"A mostly incoherent mess, bewildered re high rating (should have read/trusted the neg user reviews). Dealing with the increasingly tiresome multi universe fantasy. Not much more than a bunch of over CGI'd action/fight scenes for who knows what purpose. 3rd act tries to bring together some semblance of story (or rationale for movie) of mother and daughter coming closer together, but there's no been reason to care or about the characters.

22 March 2023,Why all the hype?,"I heard nothing but good things about this movie, then it cleaned up at the Oscars, so I went in expecting something decent.

It's not often I can't finish a film, and I watch some real trash on Prime, but I couldn't get through this. Convoluted plot, woeful acting from everyone other than JLC, just an awful, boring mess. I gave up after some mass brawl in an office block and I don't intend revisiting it. Some of the absolute dirge that gets highly rated in the modern day truly puzzles me it really does. You'd expect a multi-Oscar winner to be in the realms of The Godfather - comic book nonsense like this should be winning Nickleodeon awards at best.

I wonder, if all the characters had been white, would this be so revered? It seems there's a real need to reward diversity nowadays, even if it's to the detriment of quality. How Cate Blanchet missed out on best actress will be a conundrum for the future film students to ponder for decades. Data from the Goonies grabs one for his first major role since the '80s, and he was as wooden as he was back then.",2
19 May 2022,don't waste your time,"Literally just made an IMDB account only for me to rate this boring film 1 star. Don't waste your 2 hours watching this awful movie. 30 minutes in and I'm already yawning. I thought the (minor) twist was going to save it but no it just kept going down and down until the end of the movie. These 1 star reviews you see are true, believe us.

23 February 2023,An embarassment - Cinema is dying,"I love cinema.

This is not it.

I tried to watch this movie three times, every time after being convinced by some acquitance of the sheer greatness and uniques of the film.

On my third watch (that is going on as I am writing this), I had to make this review. I hate saying it, but its really trash, lowest-tiered entertainment with philosophical aspirations that are laughable.

The key purpose that it served is that it showed that no reliance can be made to film reviewers, critics and that cinema seems to be on a steep downward road.

If this movie was made say 15 years ago, when there was actual competition, the movie and its creators would be ridiculed.",2
1 April 2023,I don't know what I watched,"My wife is Chinese and I am American, and we both just watched what I thought would be an interesting movie being an Oscar winner for 7. However, this winning solidifies that Eternal Sunshine on a spotless mind should have won to all those years ago. There were parts my wife fell asleep, parts that made me laugh, and even parts that were jackass the movie strange. It was hard to follow with language going in and out, and with action sequences it made me a little sick, but it's what Hollywood and todays society want, kindness and love. Except, the world doesn't work that way in parts of it. I honestly am just happy Jamie and Goonies guy got an Oscar, but I have to go watch something else or I will have bad dreams tonight.

22 March 2023,Utterly and abomination!,"What the heck! Literally this is an utterly joke ... For the fist time in my life I walked out of the screening room. What's wrong with the film industry nowadays? With the Oscars ? They should be ashamed, Michelle Yeoh should be ashamed, Jamie Lee Curtis... everyone should be so ashamed of accepting awards for this big fiasco.

I came to the movie theatre for all the good reasons: first Asian woman to win an Oscar in a leading role, references to kung fu classics, indie films, original script, kitsch photography etc all that was so badly executed form the beginning without any sense.

I hope soon they will come out with a statement to clarify, that this was actually a joke or an experiment to defy the modern standards in the film industry or something, because this is unbelievable.

26 January 2023,The best part of this movie?,"Reading the 8, 9 and 10 star reviews here as people go overboard with superlatives trying to ""sell"" this movie. Some of the reviews feature adjectives that aren't even actual words.

I gave up on this with a half-hour yet to go.

At the core of this movie is an unoriginal concept about how our lives would be very different if we made different choices in life. In this movie the mechanism isn't angels (""It's a Wonderful Life"",""The Family Man"") but the now overused narrative device of ""the multi-verse"".

The emotional core of the movie is about a harried Asian woman and her gentle-mannered husband as well as her strained relationship with their daughter.

So far so good.

Then it goes off the rails. It all gets buried under a ton of overdone wire-work martial arts, much shouting and screaming and lots of frantic special effects.

Like a LOT. Like about sixty minutes too much.

I think it was the point where our heroine is fighting two dudes who have anal plugs dangling from their asses that I just rolled my eyes and gave up on it.

At this point I was losing the thread of the plot and, honestly, didn't care about it anymore.

I wanted to get on with an actual story, but we see the same scenes more or less repeated over and over. Crazy fight scene... heroine dies or seem thoroughly defeated... no, wait! She's back up again for another crazy fight scene. And another. And another. Quiet emotional scene with husband or daughter. Then MORE fighting.

It's exhausting and you're a better person than I am if you can get through this endurance contest.",4
13 March 2023,I really liked...,"...the frenetic pace, the humor, all of the absurd parts, but underneath the fun, this movie is just another young adult melodrama, with a bunch of talented actors pushing the emoting up to 11, but around issues that are just petty and banal. The second half, in particular, is just a series of supposedly meaningful dialogue presented with tears and trembling lips. The humor cannot take away from the fact that this movie has nothing to say, really, but takes itself very seriously still. Piling on the allegory does not cover up that the conflicts underneath are just not very interesting or profound. Even Michelle Yeoh was a disappointment.

23 March 2023,Over hyped and over rated.,"So that's what a bad acid trip would feel like! It left me with a but of a headache to be honest, why it won all the Oscars is beyond me, however I do feel like a lot of the praise is from those not wanting to be seen as not ""getting it"" .. well I didn't ""get it"" but then I lost interest about half way though so? I agree it was original, original in the way that if Kill Bill, The Matrix and Inception had a baby, when that baby grew up a bit, went to university and took drugs, it would have made this movie. I am so glad I didn't pay to watch it in the cinema, it was just too, too much, everywhere, all at once.

14 March 2023,"Crazy times, brain usage forbidden","It's a bad movie, but as a comedy is not bad, it has a few funny moments, typical Chinese humor. I lived in China for many years, I know mandarin, I understand their humor (although I don't find it funny, it's very childish) and I know that everyone likes Michelle and they want her to be celebrated. Ok fine, but we'll just, out of nowhere, pretend that meritocracy doesn't exists? We'll just award a product not for its content but for its meaning? Saying this movie is good is the same thing as saying bugs taste good. Bugs have protein, so let's just say bugs are much more delicious than steaks, because of how it represents environmentally. It's more politically correct, so let's all forget about flavor, taste quality, appearance, let's just play the pretend game and just pretend disgusting things are awesome, they're the best stuff in the world. That's what Hollywood and their shills are saying, awarding this movie and saying this is the best movie ever. This is a crazy comedy movie, almost unwatchable, unless you're just passing time, chatting with friends and checking your phone while watching the movie.

People, can we just go back to award stuff that is actually good? And don't bring that ""oMG yOu diDnT uNdeRstAnD"", we all understood the movie, it's a stupid movie for depressing people who spend their whole day on social media, this movie is basically a long tiktok video.

But some part of me just says: Ah, nevermind this, no one cares about the oscars anymore, and let them have their fun, they're happy. We had our fun with great masterpieces like Goodfellas, The Godfather, Training Day, Inception, The Wolf of Wallstreet, Interstellar, all those really good movies. Now it's time for the... simple people have their fun. I guess we too should pretend that this movie is good, so that you guys feel good. So, yeah... OK.

13 March 2023,Best Actors in one of the Worst Movies of 2022,"I am a big fan of Michelle Yeon. In fact, been watching her martial arts movies and other movies that she starred in over the years. Here too she is doing a great job. And her screen husband, Ke Huy Quan is a gem in martial arts. And Jamie is unrecognisable and amazing in her role.

But that is where it ends. The story, utter rubbish from Marvel garbage. The screenplay all over the place. The visual effects, not sure if there is any.

Yes, I endured it for 43 mins as I felt guilty to switch it off earlier due to the nominations and the great actors work.

But this is unwatchable. I really hope the makers take a hard look next time.

14 March 2023,Drivel - Not Great -,"In what universe is a film starring Jamie Lee Curtis with hotdogs for fingers considered Oscar-worthy? The answer to that question seems to be 'this one', Everything Everywhere All At Once having been nominated in eleven categories at the 2023 Academy Awards. I'm beginning to wonder if I've somehow slipped into an alternate reality where a film's worth is measured by how quirky, irritating and baffling it is.

I believe that this film's success is down to viewers not wanting to admit that they don't 'get' it - ""It's A24, and that means it's intellectual, and if I say I don't understand it everyone will think I am stupid"". Well I think you're stupid for playing along.

So what's the film about? Well, Michelle Yeoh plays laundromat owner Evelyn Wang, who discovers that the universe is made up of infinite parallel realities, each one different, and that an evil force is attempting to... ah, who am I kidding? I can't sum up this film. I tried to follow the plot, but there's so much random crap crammed into the excruciatingly tedious 139 minutes, all edited so as to induce a migraine, that I soon found myself struggling, not just to understand the plot, but to stay watching till the end.",1
28 September 2023,"Some Sort of Insane, Drug-Induced, Deranged Version of the Matrix","Michelle Yeoh can usually be counted on to be in decent films but I knew this was going to be bad when it immediately starts off with their daughter dating an ugly tatted up lesbian while the manic mother (Yeoh) kept making a bad Jewish joke about actress Jenny Slate having a ""big nose"" yet she is the best looking actress in the entire film.

There is this odd trend in certain films of trying to make gibberish into science fiction. In this doing moronic nonsense like eating ChapStick, chewing old gum stuck under a table and giving yourself paper cuts between your fingers helps activate a plot device. I literally felt myself getting dumber the longer it went on and the more I watched, the more I wanted to kill myself.

Jamie Lee plays an obnoxious IRS agent who turns into some zombie terminator in the most cringe inducing way possible. I don't know if the writer, producer or director were all high on drugs when they decided to make this but it is painfully bad. Over and over again they inject weird and bizarre scenes with lame Kung-Fu sequences to the point of a migraine.

If I could give this film a negative 10 rating I would, as it is some sort of insane, drug-induced, deranged version of the Matrix. Avoid at all costs.",1
22 May 2022,When you get misled by user reviews,"There are many more lower rated movies worth watching compared to this.

I always hate movies that are pretentious. People tend to give them interpretations and meanings that are not really there. Aside from it being dragging on many occasions, I find the presentation a bit chaotic; like some abstract art where there is a bandwagon consensus of a deeper meaning and a more profound message that is non-existent.

17 March 2023,Subversive,"If you don't have anxiety about the IRS, you will after watching this. If your teen child is uncooperative, you will start to worry big time after the watching this. If you always wanted a butt plug, watch this. If you wanted to listen to hours of unpleasant speech, watch this. If you want to be bombarded with lightening images amidst chaos, watch this. Whatever you do, say you love it. And agree with Oscar morons who must own Asian stock. This film is unpleasant to watch.

It is excruciating to listen to. I have seen other majestic Asian films. Why would anyone think this has humor? The receipts spread out for an audit is a nightmere. The IRS is never something to joke about. The multi universe is just more unpleasantness. I bought the dvd hoping for greatness. I discovered subversion.

10 April 2023,Stunningly bad,"I'm honestly amazed that anyone could give this complete mess a good review. That fact is a clear reflection of how far our society has fallen.

This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is so close to the worst that you can just consider it so. Incomprehensible, stupid beyond words, offensive and disgusting at parts.

If there is a point of redemption for this movie it must have come in the last hour, because, at the point where the words ""The End"" came across the screen we said ""thank God"", only to see that there was actually another hour to go. At that point we said ""no way"" and turned this cinematic disaster off.

How this qualified to even be in the running for an Oscar is hard to comprehend, let alone win so many. Could all of the other movies actually be so incredibly bad that this rose to the top?",1
28 May 2022,Too long.,"If this move had been 1.5 hours it would have been a fun and amusing watch, with good acting and witty connections between generational gaps, Asian parenting set against a clever underlying set of multiverse of you with different skills. 2.2hours turned the movie into one I was just happy ended as it had no new ideas and it dragged out the silly making them dull. Great performance by Michelle Yeoh.

27 March 2023,I Expected Greatness...I Got Jipped.,"I heard someone say this should win ""Best Picture"". When it did, I thought maybe the Oscar's got it right.... No! How this measures up to Best Pictures in the past is beyond me.

The term ""multiverse"" should have been a tip to my disappointment but I watched. As others mentioned. I enjoyed the last part, but the other parts were just a movie. Jamie Lee Curtis did not deserve an Oscar for that role. If I were given the choice, I thought the daughter, Joy, was more deserving.

I just don't get why this won all these awards and such praise. Oscars, as usual, are NOT a measure of greatness...at least not in this universe.

6 June 2022,What a mess,"I really had to force my way through this one. The plot makes no sense whatsover. Some funny moments and cool ideas regarding the multiverse and how we are living all these parallel lives. Not sure that is true or not but it's fun to think so especially when nothing goes our way. The characters are boring and miserable except the dad who is quite sweet and has some serious kung fu moves! The trippy sequences were not done very well. Reminded me a bit of that film Mr. Nobody which i never got. And also the show Legion which did this kind of thing at a very masterful level with cool, sexy characters with dark humor and great music mixed in (unlike in this besides Debussy piano toes part, that was funny). At least the film is attempting something different which i can appreciate. Just never connected with the story or characters, I felt like I am having a bad trip and please be over soon and it just kept on going and making less and less sense. I wish it would've ended the first time it said The End when there was still an hour to go. Anyways, I'm Markus and this is my first review.

There are very few movies I've turned off before the end. This one was stuck in a boring loop of inter-portal jumping while nothing really happened and could not bear it any more.

I'm confused as to how this nonsense received any attention when there are other films on display this year that are astoundingly brilliant and moving.

Is this some kind of statement being made by the awards panels which I do not know about or understand?

I couldn't even laugh or cry. I paused many times to see if I understood the purpose of this despicable joke.

How to identify if it's science fiction, adventure, comedy with this crazy script?

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences showed that to win an Oscar you don't need to have quality.

Movies in my opinion shouldn't be hard work and that's what this movie was hard work from start to ever so long finish. 2 hours and 19 minutes of crazy.

Well, like so many times before, the science fiction is a fake wrapper designed to hook more viewers. There is little of substance here in that regard and you'll be angry afterwards. I went back and re-watched Jet Li's ""The One"" to rescue the situation.

The remaining aspects of the film are a blend of cheese, stupidity, crass attempts at humor and of course woke preaching. Funny how none of the 'verses featured a normal nuclear family, since that wouldn't fit the accepted narrative.

So ultimately a waste of time.

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

2 July 2022,Totally overrated!,"I have a high expectations of this movie not only the high rating but also with positive reviews about its creativity and implication. I end up getting a sound sleep at the last half hour. It starts off not that bad with developing some funny characters but then it get lost with having just a single plot about a woman's head splitting. This scene pops up over hundred times which becomes a kind of nuisance and chaos.

28 December 2022,Minority View,"I'm going to be in the minority view here.

Because from the title on down, this film made little sense. I'll say up front, maybe I have to watch it again. It put me to sleep at some points.

Title: It's not the ubiquitous, all-encompassing, relatable story the name suggests. It's a very specific, unique perspective told of events that quite honestly, will never happen to most of us (read: any).

Because, while Im a massive fan of Marvel, this film's clumsy take on the multiverse setting is either a cheap imitation or a poorly executed one. And overly complicated, as with the Marvel movies.

Minorities: Probably I'm not allowed to speak of this, but just because you have actual Asian actors, doesn't mean you can use the same cliches: laundry store- owning, helicopter-y, disapproving traditional mom, slavishly beholden to her aging parents, poorly understanding the complicated American system... And there's more that I can't even think of now.

But come one, much of this was cringey, and I'm not in the afflicted minority. I'm surprised there aren't, if not protests in the streets, at least a little more backlash from ""critics."" I'm usually on board with the prevailing sentiment on these ""great"" films, but here's one I have to be in the minority upon.",4

20 May 2022,Second time I've walked out the movie theater early in my life,"Walked out after 40 minutes, was anxiously waiting to tell my gf I painfully can't watch this anymore. The movie was stupid, I love the concept of the multiverse but it was done in a silly stupid way, not scientific. Like how are you going to be stupid enough to go into a different universe when you're in mid convo with the IRS. Why would you fight security in the IRS when they have all of your info... why would anyone think you're a hero for that. I was originally excited to see it because of the reviews, but in my entire patience I sat and watched as long as I could. I think im just a deeper thinker and have read and watched a lot of science based theory's. The execution of the concept was boring and stupid to be blunt. I do not recommend the movie and am baffled at how it has been getting high reviews.

1 January 2023,"I felt like I took drugs, and got a bad trip...","So, the movie Everything Everywhere all at once (2022).

The first few minutes of the movie are really promising.

Just a normal intro. But then it gets really weird, and not in a good way. It also gets really boring.

Thats why I lost my interest really quickly.

The music in the movie is okay, and the images are also okay (could be better though).

I didn't see any famous actor, when I recall it correctly.

For anyone who wants to watch this movie, I would say DO NOT DO IT. ITS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME.

I always check the trailers on for head of the movies and series online. Hoping this will help.",2
20 May 2022,Complete Waste of Time,"I watched about 2/3's of this. Just couldn't force myself to watch the rest.

It's weird and bizarre and just didn't flow very well.

The filming was good and character did their job. Some of the scenes would have been better to just leave them out. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.

30 April 2023,"7 Oscar's, countless 10/10 ratings... OMG!","Somewhere in the middle is a 3 min scene with 2 stones talking. Really sweet and... moving! 2 points for that! And that's it! You can skip the rest. Find this scene in a preview/trailer and you're good.

The movie is hard to watch because it is confusing. Constantly skipping from scene to scene and mixing English and Chinese dialogs. This constant skipping gets on your nerves because it is pointless and random. You can mix these scenes in any order and it's the same movie. I bet that if somebody would do that, nobody would notice when watching a second time. Better, you can take an one hour nap and you won't notice because it's the same crap repeating itself at random.

Content was grotesque. Doing random bodily harming and sexual actions to move between universes is daft and a script for low IQ audience.

Oscar's for acting? Really? Acting was just ok. A plus for JL Curtis.

Personally I stopped watching after 90 min and forced myself to resume the second day to discover the promised deep meaning that everybody is talking about. There is none! Just endless crap.",2
14 March 2023,Awful.,"We all know why this has been showered with awards and praise, and it has nothing to do with the quality of the movie itself.

All it's to do with, is back slapping about how virtuous and inclusive Hollywood is. So tiresome, and no wonder Hollywood is struggling when a niche product like this is praised to the heavens, and movies genuinely loved by film goers are left out in the cold.

When are Hollywood going to wake up and realise they need to start appealing to the masses again if they're to survive?

Going to the cinema isn't a cheap night any longer, and promoting stuff like this that is going to appeal to a small minority of people, isn't going to convince people to go again.

26 January 2023,After the Oscars,"This mess of a movie is totally insulting to the general population of movie goers. The possibility exists that the Producers, writers and directors thought they could use ""the emperors new clothes"" tack and make a really idiotic movie. They were hoping one critic would love it and the praise would snowball. However, the general population sees through it (see how many folks here rated it very low). I've seen thousands of movies in my lifetime and almost all of the 95 Best Picture Oscar winners. Some were great and other mediocre, BUT nothing even comes close to this insulting, moronic, idiotic movie. We should all feel insulted that the Academy members voted for this movie and gave it 7 awards and the critics gave it high praise. They must think we are really stupid. How dare they. They have forgotten they still need our support or they just don't care.

Before the Oscars This movie has a unimaginable plot line that moves so quickly you are not able to follow it. There are so many quick changes and poorly done special effects it renders the plot line totally confusing. There are some really good actors, but I wonder how they felt about the finished product. The Hollywood elite gave it 11 Oscar nominations. Why on earth! For those of you who liked this movie, I am glad you did, but you need to check out past Oscar nominated/winning movies to see the difference. I started watching this a few weeks ago and stopped after 20 minutes realizing what a bad movie it was, but after the nominations I decided to give it another chance. I barely finished it while shaking my head in disbelief the entire time.",1
14 March 2023,A Movie About Nothing,"I realize that I'm old-fashioned, but I prefer movies that have a plot. This is a movie about nothing. The fight scenes rapidly got tedious because nothing was ever settled; they just jumped to another universe. And I never figured out what they were fighting about anyway. I wasn't sure whether the parts that I thought were funny were actually intended to be humorous. The ending was corny. I gave it 3 stars for the creativity that it took to come up some of the universes. And because it's not the worst movie that I've ever seen, or even the worst that I've seen in the last year (Top Gun Maverick was worse).

Unfortunately, the 7 Oscars and all the other awards from other festivals proved that Hollywood has reached a decline. Every year, the films that are awarded, get worse and worse. Is it possible for this movie to have as many Oscars as Lawrence of Arabia????? What's going on here??? The Oscars were to be shared between Tar and All quiet from the western front.

I put the two stars just for the effort!!

22 March 2023,"Reminds me of ""Sucker Punch""","A woman with lots of problems - financial, family - escapes mentally into different parallel worlds where she is some kind of heroine determined to save all worlds and fights against an evil entity which she thinks has taken over the tax collector and her daughter and is to blame for everything. Some unneccessary vulgarity, very boring plot, non-interesting characters. Inconsistent ways to travel to parallel universes - e.g. Pee your pants, blow into the nose of somebody or start dancing. It is like a low-budget movie made by students. This movie is way too long for what it delivers, should have finished after part 1 (there are three parts - everything, everywhere and all at once). I did not enjoy a single scene. The references to - much better - movies like ""Ratatouille"" and ""The Matrix"" were childish and lame. I cannot comprehend why this movie won any Oscar.

Well I got where we started and where we ended, but the two hours in between are two hours of my life I'll never get back is as much as I can say. Bizarre doesn't begin to do it justice. There's absolutely zero narrative that gets you from the beginning to the end. It's two hours of nonsensical mind mash. I cannot fathom all the Oscars, in particular, and I mean no disrespect to a great actor, Jamie Lee Curtis. Her character was quirky yet pointless, she did her best but Oscar worthy, no! All I can say is don't believe the hype, this is awful!

No again... an original concept acted out well with decent performances but come on... I remember a time when movies that won these major awards were moving, or even memorable. I have nothing against anyone involved in this film but seriously do you really believe this is worth all the plaudits you're getting. If you're honest the answer is no... Can't say I'm surprised. This is nothing brand new. The last 5-10 years the major award winning films are just the leftist Hollywood virtue signalling. Shame on you.

13 March 2023,Overhyped,"I thought it was decently made, really incredible idea, but not necessarily unique. It makes you ingest a ton of depressive ideas, which are difficult to follow at times, before it delivers the emotional antidote. Makes you feel like depresion is the default if you're not able to achieve anything. This made it difficult to enjoy, since the climax of the delivery was based on your acceptance of some pretty sorrowful views to begin with. Superb acting, great effects, and lovely idea, but the execution was misguided imo. The amount of hype is a bit egregious at this point, since only the acting and effects were award worthy.

24 May 2022,Contrary Opinion- Not Impressed,"The movie's production value itself is quite incredible and I found myself frequently enjoying the action scenes and the character growth.

I however, dislike the basis of which the plot forms. It centers around a nihilistic approach on life that nothing matters and our dent in the universe is basically zero. The life of the characters is seen as meaningless and that nothing matters. It also puts too much of an emphasis on choices when our reality is that our freedom isn't as much as we think.

The movie itself was very difficult to follow. Lots of jumps and cuts. The mechanisms of action are hard to understand. Events happen in the plot simply without explanation as to why. The producers couldn't seem to determine if this movie was a drama, a comedy, or a sci-fi.

14 March 2023,Pseudo-intellectual chaos,"It's one of those things with the Oscar winners of recent years. Most of the time, not many viewers want to see the films and the question always arises whether commercialism is fundamentally not worthy of an award and whether the Oscars must always be about art, which is often very subjective. In the case of the winning film of 2023, I can only say that I am not really happy with the decision. After 30 minutes I didn't understand what it was all about and even though I think Michelle Yeoh is well worth seeing, I am left with a question mark as to whether I would really have given her the Oscar for best actress. Strangely enough, this comedy as such doesn't work at all. Hectic, overloaded with prejudices, including racist moments, which, however, originate from the supposed Chinese woman, comedy that is more reminiscent of bad slapstick and individual performances that don't add up to anything. After 30 minutes I was no longer prepared to get involved in the story, which is unravelled in such a confused way that I suspect that quite a few viewers will not have experienced the ridiculous kung fu scene in the tax office at all.",4
27 February 2023,Horrible,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie. I suspect it is the Lemming syndrome where everyone is jumping off the cliff with glee together.

I am not one to agree just because others do. I thought this production was pure crap, and I clearly land in the minority on that point according to the vast majority of reviewers. But I'm totally ok with being where I am on this one.

For starters I don't like sub titles, secondly I find asian dialects irritating at the best of times, then when the sub titles were turned off I could barely pick out any words due to the very thick accents. I totally dismissed this garbage when a female actor laid a beating on someone using a pair if dildos as weapons. Pretty much the worst piece of garbage I've ever wasted my time watching. Oscar sweep? Laughable.

Next minute, the film changes set, just because. There's nothing fantastic in it, just a change of set as if you were playing a videogame: one button to to the left, one button to the right... and some characters mumbling an irrelevant dialogue. Really amazing is the fact that this year you have great films like ""T√°r"" and this poor game of mirrors is celebrated like a real piece of cinema. The audiences, specially young people, are being taught to dispise the purity of cinema.

The Choices made affecting the destinations to the next choice & the next which her never ending with all decisions made and a nearly infinite multitude of possible timelines for which there is only one. Not imagine all possible conclusions of those happening at once and you have the minor twist in this story. Laying to the selfish nature of people, there expected stupidity of children only wanting for themself, the experience of life's wisdom wanting to teach young persons before they can make they mistakes they don't even know exist and the drama of all of the typical life moments that we are smart enough to know and not waste a moment watching on film. You have seen this one before, it's a skip. There are better things for you out there.

8 March 2023,The film for our times,"Unlikely award winner Everything Everywhere All At Once is perhaps the first film to capture the chaotic mental dopamine of constant Internet use, which is not necessarily a good thing, though obviously most people can relate. Attempting philosophy, action, and comedy all at once, the film can be best summed up as a mixture of the Matrix, a Stephen Chow or Jackie Chan film, It's a Wonderful Life, and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. A disparate set of influences, nearly all of which are better films.

Stylistically, the Daniels borrow the most from Michael Bay here, pushing his type of rapid-cut, juvenile sensory overload to arty levels. They nevertheless lack both Bay's sense of composition (con), and also his misanthropy (pro, though the stuff they do to Jamie Lee Curtis goes beyond unflattering). Still, the overall effect the film produces is about the same, especially when it comes to the humor.

Unlike the Kung-fu comedies of Chow, the humor of EEAAO lacks a sense of comic delirium and is mostly fractured and crude instead. When in Chow's 'Shaolin Soccer' a soccer game transforms into a trench war, it's funny not only because it's unexpected, but also because it parodies the intensity of the sport. Had the Daniels made that film they would have just as likely turned the game into a sex dungeon. Too often they're only willing to throw random stuff at you in place of actual wit---the concept that alternate realities can be experienced through statistically improbable actions is funny at first, but gets dull very quickly, especially as it's used almost exclusively for high school gross-out humor: inhaling flies, sticking mucus in someone's mouth, etc.

The resulting action scenes lack the smooth inventiveness of even a lesser Jackie Chan film. For another example, the fight in 'The Accidental Spy' where Chan, completely naked, tries to beat off several assailants (while covering his privates with anything at hand) is infinitely funnier than anything offered here. The main reason is that the best humor, like Chan's, needs some basis in reality so you can understand the characters' reactions and frustrations. The Daniels have that in the opening scenes but quickly abandon it, choosing instead to indulge a kind of TikTok randomness.

It can still be imaginative (I'll give it that) but only up to a certain point. You'd think a reality where people evolved giant hot dogs for fingers would look entirely different even in terms of simple objects such as doorknobs and shirts, but the Daniels merely show us the same world, only where people play the piano with their toes and squirt condiments at each other. Again, this is more about throwing random crap at the screen instead of allowing the premise to develop naturally.

So the film fails as a comedy, but how about as a philosophical tract? Like 'It's a Wonderful Life', EEAAO deals with the lost chances of life, 'what might have been' through alternate reality. It goes without saying that Capra's film is far more mature and thoughtful, but it's also more emotionally moving. The Daniels are able to engage nihilism head-on, since especially in the face of the infinite multiverse any form of meaning melts away. The problem is that they don't know how to address it; the idea that humans are no more than insignificant specks is only indirectly repudiated, and the final message is spoken: 'We don't know what's happening in this world, but just be kind to each other!' This conclusion is so basic that it's beyond criticism, except for the fact that it is so basic. EEAAO lacks Capra's edge---advocating as he did kindness and happiness even in the face of intolerant cruelty---though the Daniels' shallow Hollywood Gnosticism has obviously struck some kind of chord in our culturally confused, digitally-addled times.",2
11 March 2023,"There isn't enough Rick And Morty to make this ""Cloud Atlas 2.0"" enjoyable.","The main draw for me to see ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"", was the fact that Ke Huy Quan was in it, since I really enjoyed his performances as a child actor, ever since ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"", I figured it would be interesting to see him in something new, all grown up, all these years later...

Also, I hated ""Cloud Atlas""; any movie that's insane and makes no sense, does not mean it's smart or intelligent, let alone does it make a great film.

I have been a fan of Rick And Morty for several years now, I have been behind the idea of there being many alternate realities / multiple universes for over a decade now, however, this film fails in everything that could have made that concept interesting on a cinematic level.

Nauseating editing and quick cutting, over the top and ridiculous acting, cheap effects that resemble a low budget ""skit"" like you'd see on Saturday Night Live (especially involving a dumb parody of the 2007 Pixar film ""Ratatouille""), everything that this film did, was done better many, many times before in different films, however it DOES succeed in being as migraine-inducing as ""Cloud Atlas"".

Nothing is explained well through any of this film's dialogue, instead leaving me no choice but to resort to the e-Cliff's Notes site (aka Wikipedia) just to make any sense of what was going on for the third act (chapter 3 or what ever).

The Matrix did it better, Kill Bill did it better, Ratatouille did it better, The Jacket (2005) did it better... oh, and Turning Red, did it better.

This film kept making me want to turn it off and switch to watching something else throughout, or well, at least after the first 30 minutes or hour; morbid curiosity, at just how far and how crazy it could possibly go, is what kept me watching until the end.

I did enjoy seeing Ke Huy Quan, though... but wow, he seriously deserves better roles and work. I mean, if he enjoyed making this film, I guess that I'm happy for him then.",1
28 November 2022,One of the worst movies ever,"My wife and I had to stop watching this garbage after 45 minutes or so. The only reason we watched this long was the 8.1 rating it had with almost a quarter million ratings. We finally got to the point we couldn't tolerate the stupidity and nonsense any longer. Don't waste your time. There isn't one redeemable quality to this movie. Annoying actors, no decent dialogue, no redeemable plot. Nothing. The funny thing was I instantly recognized the one actor as Data from the Goonies and Indiana Jones movies. Jamie Lee Curtis sure got old too. I'm just writing this last stuff to meet the minimum character requirement.

Terrible movie. Just terrible!

9 April 2023,Where are we going to?,"The fact that this movie was even nominated speaks volumes of what we already knew long ago about the Oscars.

That it gets nominated, that there are good reviews and critics, speaks about money. However, that people out there is saying convincingly it is good, that it has 9/10 ratings, is a bleak outlook of our future.

I could not force myself to watch the entire... thing. Believe me, I tried. Did not have the stomach, and frankly, nor the time.

Extremely bad script, horrible photography, bursts of bad acting by everyone, and I mean everyone. Terrible directing, sad attempts to comedy, very cheap production. No plot line. Nothing to rescue here.

One thing that baffles me, is that no one involved in this movie said ""I'm sorry, this is wrong, I can't""",1
3 October 2022,I am wondering if there are voting bots that gave this film 30% 10/10 votes.,"This film had an interesting premise and some interesting ideas and some interesting images. Unfortunately, those who made the film did not now that ""less is often more"" and they tried to overwhelm the viewer, reiterating the same ideas, recycling the same (or similar) fighting scenes, hitting you over the head over and over, until one wants to shout at the screen ""enough! I got it already!"". It gives the impression of a dish in a restaurant where they pile up the spices, the calories, the textures - just to impress you.

If someone would have edited this film to about 70% of its actual length, it may have ended up a more than decent film.

I would have American directors spend some time watching (quality) European or Japanese films and learn why ""less is more"" and that ""louder"", ""shocking"" and ""overwhelming"" are not conveyors of quality.",4

It is all over the place, not funny, nor touching. I have no idea what movie the people giving high scores are watching, but not the same i watched lol. I gave it a one star to average out the high score so people don't get fooled into paying $20 to watch this in the cinemas.

20 May 2022,"Acid, LSD and other Trips.","Sounds like a 'syfy' story, starts like a soapie and unfortunately ends like one. In-between is a maze of scenes which could be confused as being classed confusing. One of those films which only those who prescribe to cult-movies will understand and enjoy.

Production is tops as well as the acting, the story is light and simple, but its the application of what's supposed to be happening which seems too exaggerated and weird.

Disappointing if you're looking for syfy!

28 January 2023,What a hot mess of weirdness,"After all the acclaim and Oscar nominations, I sought out this film ready to be wowed. Wow, alright.

This was just weird and, frankly, boring. Really boring. That people claim to have been mesmerized and profoundly impacted by this film is frightening.

I don't care to work that hard when I'm the one who's supposed to be entertained. After nearly 1 hour, I still had no clue what was going on or why I would care in the least.

I was so disappointed because, and I'm not joking, this film seemed more like a very amateur foray into, I don't know, Scifi? Action? Mind freaking? Creativity?

Bolognie. This is nothing more than David Lynch weirdness or Cronenburg weirdness, just not as good.",3
19 March 2023,Emperors new clothes,"I love indie movies. So when I read abou this movie, I was hoping to see a good one, but it was a big let down. The movie isn't original, the message is generic and done before, and the acting is moderate. Especially if you consider the previous movies they all played in before. To me this is a case of 'the emperors new clothes'; people like it because other people say so. Even if they don't understand it, they have to like it because of FOMO. I also watched the other oscar contenders and it's painfullly clear this movie didn't deserve the awards. It's good Aian actors got an award, but as said before, they've been in much better movies. I am look at you Crouching tiger, hidden dragon, which is btw more a representation of what Chinese people like to see than this movie. EEAO just tries to be different and dazzle you with cheap effects and a pseudo-science sauce, but not once it gets the right message across. This could've been a much better movie if they changed the wacky style. This is not a movie for the public, this is a movie for the directors themselves, and thus they don't appreciate their viewers. It gave me a headache after four viewings. I wanted to like it, but no... avoid this one.",1
28 June 2022,A confusing mess,"The sound in this movie made it hard to follow or understand what anybody was saying, the actors whispered or talked too fast, too much background noise. Visually the movie is like experiencing an epileptic siezure. Just a confusing mess.

10 March 2023,Make it make sense!,"Once upon a time I decided to watch this movie to see why it was getting so many award nominations. I was shocked to find out how hard this movie was to watch. All the characters talk over each other, the scenery is a mess, the plot is a mess, and honestly, you'll have a better time if you turn down the volume and just imagine up the dialogue yourself. Following the plot is a headache and if you make it half way through the movie you won't really care how the movie ends anyway...You'll just want it to stop.

This is a movie where the cliffs notes will suffice. My advice to anyone is avoid avoid avoid.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head.

31 December 2022,A Mess,"I watched this film based on the 8.1 rating and some of the rave reviews and I am astounded at such praise for this mess of a film.

It started out fine as Michelle Yeoh and her husband are called to an IRS office in a dispute over the taxes they owe on their laundry.

Jamie Lee Curtis is funny as the IRS auditor who is making their lives difficult.

Early on the film turns completely bizarre with Yeoh entering an alternate universe with a series of nonsensical scenes and endless kung fu encounters with numerous villains.

A giant bagel is at the center of the story and it left me scratching my head in bewilderment.

Please take my advice and save yourself from two hours and nineteen minutes of nonsense.",3
19 March 2023,Def. not Oscar worthy,"Sitting through the first 30 minutes was hell. Trying to keep up with whatever was happening was exhausting. The characters were definitely trying too hard, everything about this film was outrageous. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody I know :)

Sometimes a very ""unique"" movie makes the cut, and gains a lot of attention-""EEAaO"" was it this time around for the Oscars. The fact that it won 7 out of its 11 nominations does not make it a great movie, just a lucky one-the Academy just perceived it as a great one, but it's not.

I strongly disagree with some of the Oscars it won, including Best Supporting Actress (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Best Actress (Michelle Yeoh)-it is clear that these two awards should've gone to Angela Bassett for her performance in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", and Cate Blanchett for her performance in ""T√°r"". Snubs aren't really strange at the Oscars, it happens all the time, but what a shame for the other great films and actors that could've won.",1

17 September 2022,Unentertaining,"The main actors and actresses were good. There was not much of a story to follow and no structure to anything. Everything was a mash of very brief absurdities / bizarre happenings (hence other reviewers referring to it as an acid trip). I kept hoping it might get better and saw it through to the end. It was really long and boring. Confusing if asking oneself - why is this still going on and what has happened to the story?

Based on reading the positive reviews, it seems like viewers feel positive from finding hidden messages about emotions and human behaviour. Perhaps too, from happenings in the film triggering personal memories.

Maybe you'll like it if you consider yourself full of emotion and have good memory.

Not entertaining if you like what you're watching to have something of a structure or a story. It was a sore disappointment.

The rating of 8.1 and top #200 makes me wonder if a lot of bots are involved. Always check the newest reviews for more reliable ones.",3
14 March 2023,"There is no story, plot, or events that you can link together","There is no story, plot, or events that you can link together and follow.. The movie is about excerpts that have no link between them. They were put together with weak plots (which won an Oscar).. I do not know how these major awards such as the Oscar, BAFTA, or Golden Globe are awarded?? ? Is it for films that do not contain a coherent story .. This insignificance wins an Oscar ? The Oscars, rather, it is correct to depend on its location in the box office, which means whether or not the film deserved to have people pay money or money to watch it. However, I regret wasting more than two hours of my life on this insignificant film.

29 January 2023,Pretentious Altered Reality,"After all the hype and buzz, we finally sat down to stream ""Everything, etc."" tonight. My first reaction is, why all the hype and buzz? There's not much here that we haven't seen in one form or another before.

* Failing relationships confronted and reevaluated? Check.

* Multi-cultural confusion? Check.

* Alternate universes? Check.

* Altered reality? Check and double check.

With the exception of the concept and script, this is a well crafted film. It's visually stunning, with exceptional acting by Michelle Yeoh. At least some of those Oscar nominations are well deserved. The martial arts sequences are technically well done, if overlong. But at its core, it's still a mishmash of pretentious clich√©s - Kill Bill meets Interstellar meets The Matrix.",5
22 May 2022,Terrible and profoundly boring,"I'm a fan of absurd humour. I like Jackie Chan & Michelle Yeoh. I like films which have a long build up... but this... this... something is just boring, pointless, stupid (oh yes, and I like slapstick humour). I couldn't even watch it till the end and had to turn off after an hour and a half, my worst spent 90 minutes. Avoid... just...avoid.

PS: my reference to Jackie Chan is meant for this second class Jackie Chan look alike...

2 March 2023,Overrated,"I was really looking forward to watching Everything Everywhere All at Once, but I was sorely disappointed by this overrated and silly B-grade sci-fi drama. The premise sounded intriguing: a Chinese-American woman who can access infinite realities and use her alternate selves to save the universe. But the execution was sloppy, confusing and boring. The movie tried too hard to be quirky and meta, but it ended up being a mess of clich√©s and nonsense. The characters were flat and unlikable, the plot was full of holes and contradictions, and the special effects were cheap and cheesy. The movie wasted the talents of Michelle Yeoh, who deserved a better script and direction. I don't understand why this movie got so much hype and praise from critics and audiences alike. It was a waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one.

2 March 2023,I passionately hate this film.,"My instincts told me to avoid after watching the trailer. It reeked of being the sort of try-hard artsy, divisive loved/hated sort of film that happens every so often. I should've listened to my instincts.

If you want a ""fun, silly"" ride, this ain't it, at least not for me. I recommend watching RRR (Rise Roar Revolt) instead. RRR was delightfully absurd and over-the-top but in an enjoyable way that leaves you in a great mood. I was similarly skeptical with that film at first, but before I knew it three hours flew by and I was only disappointed it had to end.

I had similar hopes for this film. Nope.

In comparison, EEAO is a flaming dumpster floating down a flooded street in a hurricane of pretentious nihilistic post-modern suck, that just leaves you feeling like you finally escaped an intensely exhausting ordeal with someone having a psychotic break.

It was painful to watch from beginning to end.

The family of characters is introduced, and they are cliche, irritating in different ways, and unlikable. You may hope that will change. It won't. The plot is paper thin with no room or time for them to believably change.

The film gradually ramps up with increasing absurdity like a bad acid trip, and once it's fully off the rails, it stays there for what seems like an insufferable eternity.

The humor: So outlandish, vulgar, and immature that even my raunchy-comedy/adult-cartoon loving partner grew tired of it very quickly.

The action/fighting: Relies heavily on the absurdity of the above humor rather than exciting originality or execution. It's stunningly dumb and unbelievable, which in turn makes it boring and unimpressive to watch. As an action fan, this probably pained me the most. I won't even mention how many films it ripped off, poorly, even as a parody.

Take the comedy, the action, and add in an extremely shallow, barely fleshed out concept of a multiverse to disappoint the sci-fi fans, and then beat it to death over and over because apparently the audience is too dumb to get it the first 50 times. It's as if the filmmakers were so utterly impressed with themselves for being 'So creative! So quirky! So edgy!' that they just couldn't stop, move on, and get on with it.

Then in the last half hour or so, the filmmakers suddenly remembered they were supposed to be making a movie and clumsily shoehorned in a bad attempt to have a point and character development. But it was too little, too late, feeling completely forced and frankly unwelcome after the pile of garbage I just endured.

I've lost a great deal of respect for anyone involved with or involved with promoting this film. I hated virtually every tortured minute of it.",1
13 March 2023,Not great :(,"Love quirky weird movies, love Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan seems a lovely guy but... what a dreadful movie! So disappointed. Seemed to just be ticking various boxes to be quirky and weird, not serving the story or the film. Acting not great, production values like an episode of Crossroads and just disappointed. Glad individually they got Oscars but overall film was really not great :(

Apparently I need to carry on writing as my review is too short. Seems a bit weird as I'd already written pretty much all I had to say, but as 600 words is the minimum I need to keep going... almost done... phew!!!

31 December 2022,it's not funny,"I liked the concept and message of this movie which is similar to ""Red panda"", a struggling relationship between an Asian American daughter and an immigrant mother. However, the graphic was horrible and all the dirty jokes are not funny and very childish... I understood that there is no mega-hit Asian SF action movie in Hollywood before, so this movie was a big deal for especially Asian immigrants. But as I'm Asian and grow up in Asia, I think this movie is overrated. I've seen greater Asian movies in my life, so hope Hollywood will catch up soon so that people don't have to praise this kind of horrible action movie.

22 March 2023,It's really not even worth your time to watch it.,"Like I just don't get the hype about this movie. Even less all the awards.

The point itself is very plain and basic, and the whole fuzz and effects around it are just annoying to watch, like it's exhausting to watch it, not thrilling as some might say.

Like I wasn't enjoying probably even a single minute of this thing.

I think I jut agree with the other 1 star reviews. Probably also because I really expected something very interesting at least.

And I wouldn't say I'm super picky about movies, but this one in particular I really cannot recommend to anyone and will never understand the hype about it.

16 March 2023,I tried,"Do not waste your time. This movie gives you a headache and doesn't make sense. Michelle Yeo is a talented actress, no doubt, but in this movie, she is completely wasted. You can't understand what's going on, and everything is messed up and confusing. I don't know how it's received Oscar or other wins, but it's not my cup of tea, sorry. You better watch cartoons or old movies rather than waste your precious time. I wanted to end the film thrice before it became a mess. In short, it's a mixture of many different characters and movies. But it failed immediately. I don't recommend it to watch. Thank you.

25 September 2022,"Everything Everywhere, All so Random","Film makers tried too hard with this one. The plot was random and made no sense, the entire multiverse but was loosely connected. A valiant yet pathetic attempt to do a drama movie differentely.

After looking at all the good reviews, i feel that it's cool nowdays to appreciate anything offbeat and absurd. The plot is so silly and unreal that it makes Marvel movies look realistic and possible.

Michelle Yeoh was good, apart from her acting it was a pain to watch the entire thing. Rest of the casting was poor, screenplay was chaotic, don't watch this one unless it's a matter of life and death. ..

10 August 2022,Too much of everything & all at once.,"This movie got very high ratings. And I get it - it's imaginative, different, crazy, unconventional. But at two hours-plus, it is also unrelenting and wearisome.

I thought it was melodramatic and ironically I had this feeling of ""I am watch this from another dimension"". I wasn't in the story, I was spectating a movie instead.

Similarly ironic, I didn't care about any of the characters whatsoever because everything could happen at any moment, all at once. There was no purpose to invest in the story because there wasn't any real threat, just chaos. The daughter said it herself: ""it is all purposeless because everything is possible"". Very nihilistic in a way.

It was fun to see the protagonist gained skills from other dimensions, but set aside the funny visual gags and fighting scenes, I didn't think that concept was leveraged that much creatively.

A movie that bombarded me with so much visuals and melodramatic craziness left me bored and uninvested.

I did love the way how the mind made the travel between dimensions possible. The production value: editing, direction, post-production, etc was top notch. The acting was average. Not bad but nothing that'll remember tomorrow.",3
6 May 2023,1 / 10.... because it has a sound,"No no no and hundred times no. Great example how and where wrong movies reached their highest potential, close to zero. Do not waste your precious time, play with your children, walk out with your dog, play with your cat but never ever make mistake like other people and me, who watched that super sick and poor movie. Unless you are super high, maybe then it does not matter. That movie definitely confirms one thing: every person can take smartphone or other camera and record the movie. Topic is not important, it must be super stupid, super strange and that is the only way to exist in current world. And you can even can Oscar for that. Crazy world.

26 March 2023,"A Kung fu, Zombie, Slasher dud","Imagine giving millions of dollars to a bunch of sophomores at film school and asking them to make a kung fu, zombie, slasher movie within a multiversal time-loop so the audience trapped inside a video game. Then with a slender plot device, stage it as a three-act play to better fool sophisticates into imagining they're seeing something weighty.

If you think that's a great idea for the best movie of the year welcome to the 2023 Academy Awards where ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" just won seven Oscars. So, now you don't have to sit (and sleep) through two hours and twenty minutes of a futuristic fable, because I already did. And what's the moral of this fairy tale? Be nice to your daughter and by all means tell her grandpa the truth.

26 July 2023,I must be really stupid,"I tried to watch this twice but could not finish it. What an awful, tasteless, senseless, pretentious pile of garbage.

The only reason I tried to watch it a second time was to try to understand what I was missing. Since most viewers loved the deep deep messages in this movie, I must be shallow and stupid.

I must admit I do not enjoy martial arts scenes very much. But I can tolerate a long fight scene if it fulfills a meaningful purpose in the plot. Even a meaningless fight scene with good choreography may be enjoyable if it does not take a very long portion of the movie. This movie takes meaningless fight scenes to a new level and sprinkles in disgusting content for added enjoyment.

Maybe I am not that stupid but I accidentally sent myself to an alternate universe where tastelessness is appreciated.",1

18 March 2023,Worst movie I've seen,"The director tries to make the film look like TikTok videos. This idea might have been good at first, but the result is hard to watch. The fast editing and bright colors make you feel dizzy and tired.

From the beginning, it is hard to understand what is happening in the movie. The quick cuts do not let you focus on the story. It is unclear if there is a real story or if the movie is just about showing off the visuals.

The actors in the movie are talented, but their performances are too much. They act in a very exaggerated way, which makes it hard to care about the characters. The main actors' acting is annoying instead of interesting.

The other actors also struggle with their roles. Their characters are like stereotypes of people on the internet, which makes them seem shallow. The things they say do not sound natural. It is hard to know if this is because of the actors or the script.

The movie is confusing and hard to follow. There are many problems with the story, and it is hard to understand what the director wants to say.

When the movie ends, you feel relieved. This film does not entertain you, but instead makes you feel bad for watching it. The movie tries to be different and modern, but it does not work. In the end, it shows that sometimes trying to be creative can go very wrong.",1
16 April 2023,Terrible pointless garbage,"What a total waste of time, energy and effort to watch this. Couldn't make it through. How could this movie possibly win even one Oscar? This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever sat through. It's not that I don't get it, I get it but it's just a waste of time. It's not funny it's not enjoyable. I'm finding it difficult to come up with 500 characters even describe how poor this film is. Don't waste your time watch anything else. I'm sorry I wasted my time. Ok, don't believe me, give it a try. On second thought, don't waste your time waste your time on giving it try. It should have received the award for the worst movie of the year.

The plot was stupid, of course the storyline has to be woke, I feel like I wasted part of my life watching this hoping it would get better. Instead it got worse and worse. I feel like I'm in school and I have to keep coming up with words because my paper is too short. I've said pretty much everything I really wanted to say. Terrible movie save your time. Stupid plot. Nothing special in the least about it. As I said I have no idea how it won all these awards. Pretty sad when you consider movies like gone with the wind and Ben-Hur and such used to be the ones that won awards. And the Godfather. Not drivel like this.

29 January 2023,A movie for PlayStation fanatics,"This movie is for those hooked on Playstation games. It's for gamers. So it just was not for me. I got dizzy with all the special effects and bouncing back and forth. Thank goodness Jamie Lee Curtis was in it, albeit as a strange oddball character. Who would've thunk she'd be a Terminator-type decades after her old co-star Arnold pulled it off so easily. Jamie Lee's IRS office outfit would certainly make a great Halloween costume.

This film was like Battlestar Galactica meets Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.on steroids. Wear a seat belt when watching the film. Be prepared for a futuristic rollercoaster ride.

29 October 2022,"It's a very, very bad movie!!!","The movie ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is boring, repetitive, with a bizarre script, childish dialogue, and bad direction. The actors look like robots directed by novices out of school. I couldn't believe that the great actresses Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis were part of the cast of this disastrous movie.

The plot may have all those allegories and metaphors that are in the review comments, but the movie is odd, weird, and full of unconvincing bestiality. It's too childish and it's the fault of directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.

The more I read the review comments, the more I wonder if I watched the same movie.

2 September 2022,Boring nonesense,"I have tried to watch this movie twice. I could watch about 30 mins at first try, second time about an hour, then I realized it's just waste of time. I don't get how this movie got an 8.2 score, I even had doubts about the movie's file I've downloaded, I had to check the trailer on YouTube to be sure.

The main problem of this movie is that there is no logic. The story won't remain loyal even to its own logic. The first 15 minutes is just irrelevant prologue about the lesbian daughter and stressful life of business and family. Then in the elevator scene we get informed that husband is from another dimension and there is no time, So the main character has to defeat an ""enemy"" in another dimension in the middle of an IRS meeting. After that, there is no destination or logic, just random battles and random dimension visits without any hurry. After an hour, comes the realization that the story hasn't progressed even a tiny bit and probably there is no story.

So this movie is a great example of why movies should have stories, non-random-well-thought stories. A better title for the movie would be ""Everything everywhere all at random in favor of protagonists, because we couldn't think of anything more sensible"". From other positive reviews, I suspect that maybe you have to be a stoner or acid user (which I am not) to enjoy this film. With all said and bad acting, the only relatively positive side of this movie is special effects. Bottom line: This is a bad Kong fu movie with some stupidest sci-fi backstory, that some may enjoy.",2
26 January 2023,Tried hard to like it,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

I was really hoping to get in to it, but nothing. So dry, no flow. In my opinion terrible acting. I still can't believe I watched 30+ minutes. I couldn't take it anymore.

6 May 2023,This is not Kung Fu Hustle,"My wife & I finally gave into this Oscar buzz. We regret it. The editing failed to convey the timelines when the characters should have had more connection. This cast was actually in 50 movies, blended into 1. By the end of the film you are left with scraps from the original act. The characters you bond with in the opening timeline were never real, which diluted the premise of the climax to the point where you simply wanted it to end. The quantum mechanics of linear timelines is an ongoing science, that has been the new hype since Back to The Future. Fortunately the classics will never be forgotten, unlike this flash in the pan shock drama.

4 September 2022,I tried - it really did,"On paper this was right up my street, sci-fi, alternative reality, and challenging concepts. The cast is fabulous, wonderful to see Ke Huy Quan back on screen, and Stephanie Hsu was just fantastic in ""Mrs Maisel"", I really hope she gets more major roles.

But .... It just went over my head. It's like an endless series of vaguely connected visuals. It's done very well, and is great to look at, but overall it's just a bit too bonkers for me. I can see why some people like it though, it's one of those films that you either get, or you don't. I didn't.

Five stars, one for the three main character performances, and two for the Rocks. The Rocks were the best part. By far.

18 March 2023,"Boring, tedious mess","Quite simply one of the worst films I have seen. How this won multiple Oscars most people will never know! Michelle Yeoh was good but that's the only praise I can give. Pretentious, nonsensical and worst of all, dull ! It was a real struggle to get through but kept with it expecting something miraculous to happen that would warrant the praise. It didn't. Having a worthy sentiment does not save this self indulgent mess of a movie taht may well do down as the worst film to win the Oscar! . Watch Banshees of Inisherin instead, weird too but a little gem that stays with you...and has actual Oscar worthy performances.

14 March 2023,Love it or Hate kind of a Movie,"Well, I go to the movies with my kids every now and then, especially when they insist on how great those movies are, in the majority of those cases I literally enjoy the movies sitting with my kids with popcorn and drinks along with blankets and good movies like Black Panther, Coco, Up and several others. This time around my daughter dragged me to this movie.

Just within 15 minutes into the movie I started feeling sleepy and after 30 minutes I was struggling to keep my eyes open, there are two things that kept me awake one the jarring outburst of sound, and second, I don't want my daughter to feel bad that I am really not enjoying the movie.

Well, I watched the movie several months back, the question is why not wrote the review then, well, as you guess, I am literally furious after last night's Oscar awards when this movie bagged every major award including a Best picture which literally boiled my blood, so please bear my rant and hence this review.

If we remember a couple of years back Academy awarded The Parasite as the best movie, well, I liked the movie to be honest, except I still don't think that movie deserved the Best Picture award.

But, this nonsense, overhyped, overacting, over VFX, basically everything over and as the name of the movie, all over the place, everywhere and without any sense of storyline, character development or cinematography, or direction.

Every now and then, our friends got divided on a few movies where a few friends thought a movie is really great and gives like 5 stars, but, the majority of us, think otherwise and give 1 star, then during the discussion, we asked those who gave 5 stars what they see that we couldn't able to see, they usually just couldn't justify or answer that question, it seems like they just try to look cool and think that if they give 5 stars to some stupid dump movie, they might look very intelligent.

This is exactly the case with this movie and I do not even have a shred of doubt, those who gave more than 5 to 6 stars, didn't even understand this movie, they just think that giving one or two stars would make them look stupid, so let us give 8-9-10 stars and look intelligent, but the reality is something different if you ask them few straight questions about this movie they won't able to answer.

And make no mistake this movie is not something like the Inspection kind where we were divided, but not as bad as this movie, we mostly ended up giving 3 stars out of 5, but others gave 5 stars, so we were kind of in the middle. But with this overhyped movie, we are firm 1 star and no one can convince us or is able to convince us through anything yet, to increase our rating to at least 2 stars, because they simply can't, there is no base on which they can able to do that, in simple term, this is the garbage movie and a waste of time and money.

It seems like Academy judges have a new trend of giving awards to some crazy Asian movies to look cool and intelligent, here is the news Academy, please go and watch the movie and just don't give an award for the sake of looking cool or intelligent, in fact, you look more stupid than a 6-year-old.

Well, the best part of the movie, of course the ending, not because the movie finished, well, that really was the best part, but in my case, my daughter realized that I didn't enjoy the movie a bit, but she said something which made it all worth. Thanks, Baba, I know you don't enjoy the movie and I dragged you into this movie, but you just sit and pretend like you were enjoying the movie just for me...I love you Baba.",2
24 May 2022,Just wasted 2 hours of my life on this garbage,"I usually don't write reviews, but this ""movie"" encouraged me to do so after I feel a victim to a bunch of 10/10 reviews and decided to give it a shot.

Tasteless, with ""humour"" deserving low-budget student-made film, this pretentious piece tries to touch philosophical matters but does it with so little quality it almost pains to watch. Just a set of arbitrary kung-fu scenes mixed with tasteless humour.

If we look at IMDB Top-250 we will see ""12 Angry men"", ""Seven samurai"" and other amazing movies having similar rating to this. Does anyone even dare to compare those movies to this piece?

I wish people who rate it 10/10 and mark as ""masterpiece"" would explain why they think it is so. Watched until the end trying to find any sense to absolute failure. Wish would have walked out.",1
15 June 2022,Disappointing! (Maybe a me problem tho),"I was amazed at the reception of this film, seeing all the glowing reviews and praise this film was getting. It was encouraging to see plus the fantastic box office as well meaning it wasn't just snobby critics that liked this film but general audiences as well.

Wow was I disappointed by the outcome after watching this film. I feel as if I have watched something completely different to what everyone else saw.

Firstly I completely respect the craftsmanship this film is made with, it is very unique, original and bold. I have to give the filmmakers/writers credit with that. Cannot claim they are doing something boring and re-done many many times. I can also understand how that would resinate with people and become popular, plus the allure of an A24 production. Also what a boost this must be for the Asian community having such a huge film like this be so popular in ""western"" culture, huge win!

It's all good being original, however its still got work as one cohesive film. That is why I do sort of feel that this film might be a ""me"" problem as well. I never got on board with the story right from the get go. Never got behind the characters, never felt attached to them in any way shape or form. This 100% feels like a film that needs multiple viewings to be appreciated and understood fully. However I was never enjoying myself watching this.........the multi-universe wall breaking concept, although fascinating, becoming very boring quickly! At some points it was almost cheesy, not a good sign!

More felt like ""To much going on"" all at once! Nothing felt cohesive as if this film had like 20 writers working on it all at once. This film aims for stars, for me it facepalms the moon....... I can see where its going and its potential however for me I just never could get into the story. It introduces a new thing and then within minutes its onto the next, nothing gets to marinade and breath.

Maybe I'll re-watch it again in the future and it'll click for me? I'm on the fence, I appreciate and can see the talent on had with the concept of the story and the directing....(acting is also fine in the film)......Sadly for me it doesn't work overall.

50% out of 100.",5
25 March 2023,Hugely disappointing and overrated,"This feels like 2 people playing at make believe in school break. Seriously absolute s###.

You swap your shoes to wrong feet shut your eyes and imagine your in a janitors cupboard and all of a sudden you're in a parallel universe? Are they having a laugh?

It alternatively peal a piece of gum from under a desk and there you are again?

The best thing about it is Jamie Lee Curtis zombie IRS worker!!

However acting has to be credited for keeping a straight face for the period of each shot.

I've read a lot of books similarly themed but this one just doesn't hold together. Not sure if it's serious or a comedy and if you have to ask....

25 August 2023,"Too much, in too many places; not what I wanted.","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

28 January 2023,What's all the fuss about?,"It's a mystery to me how this film managed to get so many accolades. I enjoyed Babylon a hell of a lot better, regardless of what the critics had to say. This film isn't so esoteric that one cannot decipher the point that life has inherently no meaning; every action and thing has a meaning in and of itself. Okay, fine. I'm not sophisticated like others in interpreting film, so I'm not going to pretend I can explain the various layers of this one or point out all the metaphors to sound smart. I'll suffice it to say my final thoughts in the movie theater were, ""I can't believe I spent the last two hours and 20 minutes feeling like I was on acid."" With that being said, I was totally on board with the Raccaccoonie Universe. I love raccoons!

14 March 2023,"If you don't understand the multiverse, don't watch it!","Written post Oscars.

This film had a lot of press pre Oscars, so I made sure I watched it before the awards. I really wanted to like this film. Michelle Yeoh is a superb actress. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant. However, this is a multiverse film and if, like me, you don't understand this concept then don't waste your time watching it. I enjoyed the acting. It was superb. It was great to see Short Round all grown up. I understand the bit about love, families, choices. But it was such a disappointment and I was thankful I didn't waste my money seeing it at the cinema. I was bored and couldn't wait for the credits to roll.

By the way, do NOT watch this of you are an epileptic..

14 March 2023,Rubbish,"I don't think I'm stupid. I've just come from a Alex McQueen exhibition at our NGV. Alex McQueen is a brilliant costume designer who unfortunately left us far too soon. As far as film making goes I thoroughly enjoyed Being John Malkovich. That too is about multiuniverses. Charlie Kaufman is a brilliant writer who wrote a very clever script. Mulholland Drive is a David Lynch film that delves in alternative realities. That too is clever with an ambivalent ending that is open to interpretation.

As far as this one goes, if the intentions of the writers is to say something about the human condition using the metaphors of multiuniverses, then sorry, I missed it. The initial premise of a laundrymat being audited by the IRS I can understand. Taxes drive me crazy. I normally reach for alcohol after I've been audited. The character in this movie I think took a tab of acid and that explains the rest of the movie. I kept with the movie till the end. I'm sorry I did because at the one hour 10 minute mark the credits appeared on the screen. The sensible thing at that point would have been to walk out of the movie. It kept going another hour and I stayed with it, which shows I'm not a sensible person.

Sorry, this movie is a convoluted mess. One star.",1
31 December 2022,Couldn't finish it,"I tried. Watched an hour even though I'd had enough after 40 minutes. I hung in there hoping I'd connect but it was so tedious I just couldn't keep going. It was hard to follow and hard to enjoy. It still had an hour to go when I bailed so maybe . . . But I just couldn't.

I suppose I should be more specific. There is a constant barrage of changing universes which is annoying. The characters aren't likeable although Michele Yeoh's character is tolerable. I got to a point where I didn't want to watch anymore. I don't know how it all got resolved and unfortunately I don't care. Maybe I'll try again but I doubt it.

The action sequences are alright but that's all that really keeps the film together. It's a visual roller coaster and I left feeling Ill.

17 March 2023,"Oh dear, where did this all go wrong?","I wrote this before the Oscar awards.

Interesting concept which seems to have been abandoned for a heavy handed attempt at moralising.

Everything everywhere all at once is what is happening in the life of Michelle Yeoh. Chaos reigns. For ""reasons"" she gets sucked into the a multiverse. And what a disappointing mutlitverse it is.

Ke Huy Quan was by far and away the best actor in this movie.

Much as I like Jamie Lee Curtis I have rarely seen more ham outwith a delicatessen.

Michelle Yeoh is a fine actor but nothing outstanding here.

20 March 2023,I feel nowhere all at once.,"Not the worst movie ever but best picture is beyond generous. I'm not sure if this is satire or not, it seems to poke fun at a particular movie that is far superior to this one. The acting is fair but nothing to brag about. This is a worst best picture winner than ""Crash"", and I am surprised to say this. It felt like a marathon getting through this and I would not return to this ever, unless I'm watching the reaction of someone else watching it.

The best picture winners have not been strong the past several years, but if ""Big Trouble in Little China"" came out today, I feel like it would win best picture because I get similar vibes from these two movies. If you need a laugh and truly want to scratch your head over how this won seven Oscars, check it out.

8 July 2023,WTF is this?,"I couldn't stand more than 15 or 20 minutes of this inane garbage.

One of the most ridiculous excuses for cinema I've ever seen.

It's the equivalent of someone throwing up, ecasing it in plastic, and calling it ""modern art"".

I'm sure some will say I didn't understand it, but the idea of a movie is to entertain it's audience........this is totally without any entertainment value.

I wasn't shocked when I saw that this thing won multiple Oscar's, that seems to be the direction the academy has gone in the past couple decades.

Apparently there's a severe lack of talent in Hollywood these days.

I'd be more entertained watching paint dry.",1
31 January 2023,Not my kind of multiverse,"The thought of paralell universes, the multiverse, has always been interesting and intriguing for our 'noble' human mind; unable to process 'unreachable situations' of such magnitude.

We stand scared and fascinated of such a reality, the possibility that another of ourselves exists, needless to say many more, throughout the cosmos. Different paths, alternate life choices.

Well, fascinating as this looks, the film does not manage to approach accordingly. It is chosen a more ridiculous, unfunny, frustrating and tiringly long view of the matter. After some time into the film, the desire of the viewer is not to continue and eagerly see what is going to happen, but instead stop watching early; as soon as possible. Continuation feels undesirable and require some kind of bravery and patience.

It is true, have not doubt about that, nothing matters really...about this film and in this film, everywhere, everything and all at once!",5
15 March 2023,Terrible picture,"A convoluted mess of a movie that tries too hard to be clever and profound but fails miserably. The plot is confusing and disjointed, jumping back and forth between different dimensions and timelines without any clear direction. I love quirky, strange movies. ""Blue Velvet"" is one of my favorites. There is a dream logic at work there. Throwing around a bunch of weirdness for weirdness sake does not make a good movie. There is nothing good here-juvenile humor, cheap effects and poor writing.

I can't believe that this movie won seven awards, including best picture. It should be nominated for a Razzie.

Ten times worse than the previous worst Oscar winner, ""Crash.""

6 May 2023,"Simple story, too much decoration","Simple enough story, but way too much decoration in terms of the special effects, battles, multiple characters and universes. It was sensory overload after a while it became tiresome and added nothing. It was so repetitive. Constantly changing props, and outfits of the characters just wasn't making the scenes any more interesting. More certainly could have been added in terms of character development in stead of so much energy going towards all the special effects fluff. It would have made me more sympathetic to the individual characters. It was in three parts and I kept hoping it was over before it really was.

19 February 2023,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"It was so weird and hard to follow. Nothing made sense. It kept jumping around in a random order and it got so confusing that I finally had to turn it off. The worst part is that I was actually angry by the time I turned it off. I was angry because I was trying really hard to follow it and I kept getting blindsided with absolute nonsensical jumps from one scenario to the next. With no flow or aim. Who made this and why? That was my main question and I still feel that way. I got absolutely nothing out of it- not even a story line. Major thumbs down.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone- unless you are a glutton for punishment lol.

28 June 2023,Disappointed-I Just Don't Get It,"I borrowed the DVD from my local library, but I kept procrastinating about watching it. I guess there was a good reason. I wanted to see it on the big screen, because there are a lot of action scenes that I thought would be more impressive than seeing them on TV. Well, I didn't get around to seeing it in the theater, so I took what I could get.

The story line, such as it is, was confusing. At first, I thought Michelle Yeoh's husband was her brother. Then after I figured that out, they went to the IRS building to meet with an agent, taking her father along with them, though he was in a wheelchair. The movie, which was already chaotic, became even more so. I bailed after about 35 minutes and I don't think I'll try to watch it again. It's partly my fault. My DVD player sometimes makes a droning sound and it's difficult to make out the conversations between the characters.

The movie was just weird. I'm not a fan of sci-fi or fantasy movies or TV shows, so already I was primed not to like it. I was glad that the heroine is an older woman who looks like a typical person, not a fantastic superwoman like some of the actresses in action movies. Maybe it's unfair of me to rate the film, because I'm judging it by the first 30 minutes or so. Even if it was free, and it is, I can't stick with it. Now that I know the directors made that movie about the corpse with Daniel Ratcliffe in it, it makes more sense that I wouldn't like this film. No, I didn't see the other one with the corpse. I just heard about it.

A friend of mine knows someone who saw EEAAO and warned him that the film was confusing. I agree. I had to laugh at some of the Kung fu fighting scenes, but otherwise I was not interested enough to continue watching it. I'm glad the actors who were nominated won Oscars, because it seems like they went through a lot. But otherwise, you can have it.",2
18 March 2023,Maybe it's me but why did I waste time on this.,"I'm sure the cast had a great time, that's about the best I can say. I think there was a plot and a message but I have no idea what it was.

Sometimes the industry gets an attack of ""Emperor's new clothes"" where no one wants to point out that something is just plain poor rubbish. In my opinion this is one of those. I felt the same about Spiderman into the Spider-verse if that helps you judge whether you may feel the same. This has a similar feel but without the Spiderman.

Simple questions, If it's a comedy was it funny? - No, If it's a thriller was it compelling? - No, If it's a moralistic message did that message get though? - No, If you had spent money watching this would you be happy? - Unlikely, Will this be something you look back on snd fondly watch the reruns in 5, 10, 15 years? I very much doubt it.

I wonder how the other nominees felt when they heard the announcement.

It's a clear message to whoever puts all their knowledge, creativity and skills on movie making that for the academy that means nothing... it's a shame but it's the truth.

The actors were fifty shades of terrible too, most of 'em were obviously extremely untalented and inexperienced, specially the husband, that makes you really doubt the intentions of the academy.

I daresay some will love it simply because it won Best Picture and ergo must be great. I didn't love it because it was exceptionally silly without being funny enough to compensate. I can't really comment on the 2nd half because I didn't last that long - I had lost all interest long before then. I'm just glad I watched it on Amazon Prime and didn't have to waste money on cinema tickets. Small comfort, mind you!

26 December 2022,Steaming pile of crap,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",1
17 December 2022,Switched off 45mins in (sorry),"I really hate to write and give a bad score like this one. However myself watching with my mum both agreed it was time to turn off around the 45minute mark.

It's just such a bizarre movie, at first I was intrigued as to what may come next, but I was only left with confusion and uncertainty.

For me it was in comparison albeit no where near its level to a ""fake"" inception movie but as previously mentioned no where near the class or production to even compare.

Upon seeing this currently rated at time of writing this review at a steady 8.1 out of 10 I'm left disapproved and dissatisfied, and begin to wonder if the ratings mean anything anymore?

Just really wasn't for myself or mum this turn round.",2
5 April 2022,Ambitious but doesn't work on many levels,"I always go for these types of crazy, imaginative, unique, out-there, weird movies. I give major props for the ambition and for showing me so many things I've never seen before. And the fight scenes, although scarce, are pretty awesome. Unfortunately this movie really doesn't work for me.

The first major issue is the comedy. I laughed a few times but most of the comedy fell completely flat for me. Comedy is subjective, so others might feel differently. My audience laughed more than me but not nearly as much as the movie wanted them to.

Another major issue is the weird factor. It goes way too far. Most of it is amusing but at some point it starts feeling weird for weird's sake. This is especially true when it comes to the story. There's not enough concrete to grasp onto. It starts feeling like a bunch of nonsense.

Lastly, the pacing and narrative don't feel smooth at all. It was difficult to tell where I was in the movie (for example, nearing the climax). Here's my theory on why:

Some movies will have what I call an epiphany moment. A moment where everything comes together, usually accompanied by heightened musical score and flashes to different moments. It usually happens in the climax and evokes emotion. In this movie, the epiphany moments comprise what seems like 35% of the movie. Scattered throughout the movie, not just at the end. But nothing ever comes together. It just keeps getting stranger with more questions.

In the end I had a pretty bad time with this movie. And I'm annoyed I drove 40 minutes to watch it in one of two theaters playing it in the Chicagoland area, which has 100+ theaters. (1 viewing, 4/4/2022)",3
13 March 2023,Feel Compelled,"I feel compelled to write this after the Oscars sweep. It's nice that Michelle Yeoh won an Oscar. As for the movie--I continue to be mystified. It starts out by introducing the main and supporting characters. Yeoh's character is the owner of a laundromat and she hasn't been keeping up with her taxes. She wants to divorce her husband. It seemed unpleasant but I kept watching, expecting a family drama of some sort. Then Yeoh and her family go to the IRS office and what could be more boring than that? Then there's a sharp twist, as it turns into a supernatural Kung Fu movie. A character starts beating up innocent people in the IRS office and I found that to be repellent, as the character is supposed to be one of the good guys. I guess it's ok to not pay your taxes and to beat up innocent people. At this point I stopped watching, but I've seen various clips from the rest of the film. It's a lot of over-the-top costumes. The overall impression I had is that this film is psychotic. I'm giving it five stars for the cast, otherwise it would be one star.

23 February 2023,Chaotic ride through the multiverse,"This is one of the two movies released in 2022 that got a rating of 8 or higher. This is in comparison to other years a poor and shocking number. Movies are getting worse. This is a fact. And what do you say if I tell you that this movie in my opinion does not earn this rating either?

Well, in terms of editing and cinematography, maybe sound, too this movie is top quality, that is not debatable but if we talk about the story which is told in a confusing and complicated way this is just solid and nothing more. As I watched it I felt a bit dissapointed because I had quite some expectations. Unfortunately the multiverse story could not catch me.

And this may be the key point if the movie fits to you or not. Do you like multiverse and stories told in a complicated way like Christopher Nolan? Than this is your movie. If not, stay away from it.",4
6 April 2023,Waste of time,"Today i spent two hours fixing my daughters iPhone, and two hours watching this crappy movie. Four hours i will never get back. At least fixing the iPhone was useful.

OK, this is not my genre, but this was just a mess. How this movie could win 7 Oscars is a big mystery to me.

Might be some elegance in the colourful production, some funny scenes...i dont know, but where to start...the story is chaotic, bouncing from one end to the other. Leaving me thinking ¬´Titanic¬ª felt like a short movie (1 hour longer).

So i will keep this short. If you are not into fantasy or science-fiction, watch another movie instead. This just felt like a waste of time. I understand i am in opposision to most people, but someone has to yell it out: this was a crappy movie!

21 May 2022,Tedious and excruciating experience..,"This movie is that kind of art - either you love it or you don't. There is a point don't get me wrong but coming to that point could have been done in a more entertaining maybe even fun way. Jokes are not that funny at all and everything seems like the producers and directors along with actors took some really heavy drugs before making this movie. I liked the ending but it was an effort to go through this entire movie without turning it off.

27 March 2023,Utterly overrated,"Awfully absurd and meaningless!

I just wasted my time watching this silly movie.

The quality of movies just dropped dramatically after COVID, but seriously this movie deserved an Oscar???? No way!

Next time if a movie won an Oscar, I may skip watching it... Overratedddddd!!!!

You must be high over the clouds to be able to write such a script, even weed can make end up with such a high amount of nonsense.

If you make zero logic out of a movie, the movie is not a masterpiece or a pioneer. It's just rubbish. I don't know how some people calls such stupid stuff rebellious and deep. Silly is silly....",1
13 March 2023,Academy Ajokes,"I was thinking to myself yesterday, when the thought residue that the Oscars are taking place floated through my mind, how giddy I once was on the day. Yes, I love movies. I still do, somehow.

How many years, now, has it been that without any ill will I simply could not care to tune in? At least four, maybe a few more. But this happened gradually, by natural erosion of faith and trust. In what? Human taste? Intelligence? You pick.

I won't speak to the movie. Scroll down the reviews for that. I wonder if its rise is yet another communal rebellion against quality, driven by the fear of being the first to stop clapping in a digital auditorium with an eye in the sky.

18 March 2023,Please let me escape from this world,"When the The Banshees of Inisherin got 0 Oscars, and this ART gets 7 - I want to teleport to other multiverse. Now.

The money spent on this movie could make a difference in this world, but someone thought it was better to record this mush by fooling the audience. I don't know who in their right mind could award this movie. It can be compared to the failed experiment of crossing Inception, Doctor Strange and Dude where is my car. I advise against enabling this for people who still have some sense of taste in this strange world we live in. Unfortunately, however, I believe that chinese threads in this movie and 7 Oscars will pay for this film if it is shown in China.

13 March 2023,Migraine induced movie,"Let's start by clarifying this. Those who give 8-10 stars are either morons who are easily brainwashed by media hype, or are paid to write glowing reviews. I am a filmmaker and I am very critical when analyzing movies with little biases and prejudices. Being Asian myself, I am more than willing to champion good Asian movies that are worth praises. BUT this movie ain't it. It's one of the worst movies I have ever watched. And I could not bare myself to finish it. Incoherent plot and mediocre actings; little character development. Bad editing! Little to no substance! There are more worthy movies that are being ignored. All quiet on the water front, which deserves more praise and awards, but got overlooked. Maverick is more entertaining by many miles. It's a hot mess from the beginning to the end. I got migraine watching it while trying to understand its reasoning and the plot. There are better movies that have the same messages about kindness and understanding out there but of course the academy was already bought and determined to give this all the awards it could fake and come up with. My advice is stay away from it, unless its free and you feel the need to torture yourself. This is movie should be a punishment by the court to all criminals, cause I am sure they would never want to commit any more crimes if the sentence is having to watch this garbage!

I sincerely hope the academy will pull its head out of its ass and start being real and objective in finding the best movie out there to consider for the awards. Either that or shut it down. Maybe Elon Mush should buy it and destroy it all together or revamp it by hiring people who know movies and those you cannot be bought.",1
25 April 2023,"""Everything Everywhere Matters to Everything""","I like the 'Daniels'. I thought Swiss Army Man was a sweet and tender loving little dark comedy with a four-quadrant head on it's shoulders telling a tale about how life sucks and life is beautiful. It showed a disturbed, singled-out, man who gave up on everything and found a deceased suicide-victim who came to life with supernatural powers. These supernatural powers gave him the life to live while also learning about life from the ""soon-to-be"" suicidal. It showed empathy, gave nostalgia, and the flaws of man. The most POWERFUL line in that movie was: ""Everything everywhere matters to everything"".

This movie does a complete 180 degrees in terms of morality and says everything means nothing and we don't know anything and you are stupid to say you ""know"" an exact one thing. While I agree with the message ""Be kind"", it detracts the ideology about diversity. I hate politics and social justice issues being forced down people's throats but isn't the point of diversity being able to co-exist with one another? Or rather The Daniel's saying ""We shouldn't exist, we don't matter."" - a line from a very famous yet skeptic nihilist Nietchze who, in my opinion, couldn't tell a goat from an amoeba.

The positives: This movie is very beautifully shot, very well edited and they deserve a raise. The team is insanely good at recurring shots with different make-up and the cinematography is more beatiful than I've ever seen. The actors go 110% with what they're given. This movie is eye-candy.

The negatIves I already spoke about but I'll end it with this: It's a very pretentious movie with two men who want to forecast their beliefs with a hammer to your head about ""life""; whereas their previous gem Swiss Army Man taught hope and acceptance in the simpler term that we can co-exist and be happy with one another rather than reject every belief system and accept oblivion.",3

11 March 2023,Fell asleep,"Saturday night, I made a bowl of popcorn, and signed up for a seven-day trial period of Showtime (notating on my calendar when I should cancel if I didn't wish to pay $10.99). The plan was to watch ""Everything Everywhere..."", an Oscar nominated movie. It was going to be great!

The opening was promising, fast moving, colorful with multiple things going on, interesting characters, eating, talking, customers in the laundromat etc. I laughed and felt optimistic about the film. And then a family trip to the IRS, but I'll say no more so as not to ruin ""the plot"".

Jamie Curtis was funny, as some sort of odd cartoon-like caricature of an ugly, older woman, government official. But then the movie slips seriously into that alternate people, universes, broom closet, who know what reality......and then some sort of kung fu martial arts thing with people flying around in the air, and by that time I was losing interest. It's starts to get confusing..How does one get into that alternate universe? By chewing chapstick or pushing the green light on your headphone...and then looking at your cellphone for the GPS coordinates?. (Did the app come from the Apple store?).

You know how four year old children in nursery school like to dress up and run around acting out some plot, that no adult can understand, but makes perfect sense to them? One might have a cape on, the other with a fairy tiara and tutu, the other has found a toy sword and plastic knight's armor vest. They run around, calling after each other, hiding and pretending to fight some imaginary enemy. It's amusing for adults to watch for a few minutes, but usually the game goes on for about ten minutes or less, not one and a half hours.

That is how I feel about the characters and plot of the movie. It seems to turn into some sort of cartoon/action/matrix-like film and as another reviewer said, I think viewers in general don't want to admit it's hard to understand. At some point I fell asleep, unintentionally. That pretty much sums up the film for me. I might give it one more try before my ""free trial"" expires.",2

The theatre which was full of college aged kids including us was fairly packed. This was my first time being in a packed theatre where the joked barely landed. It was dead quiet and everyone was pretty bored and disappointed including me and my friends.

This movie physically hurt to watch. I enjoyed my popcorn though. I'm only reviewing because I can't understand the high ratings after watching that movie. It was too much garbage and not enough actual content.

30 March 2023,I am a bit puzzled,"Sincerely... I tried already 5 times to watch and I cannot reach the half of it. Maybe the second part is great but the first part is a boring non-sense mixture of poor martial arts and some sort of multiverse future. I did not even like the performances which were kind of ""funny"" as if it was a comedy. I still did not get what kind of movie this is. Is it a comedy, a thriller, a martial art movie or a hymn to women? Please explain. And believe me I tried. It is frustrating not being able to see the end of the movie because it is so boring you cannot get towards the end. So maybe I should just resist and keep going? My advise is no. Do not waste your time.

29 December 2022,Shallow flashy movie with good cinematography and no cinsistency.,"Do you know what a MacGuffin is? Basically it's a plot device with no reasoning or depth, that exists only to move the plot. Well here, you have a movie where every character is a MacGuffin. Cinematography is the only thing that stands out with quality here, and for that I give it 5 stars. The story is all over the place, non of the characters have depth to them. Evil guys are evil just to be evil, good guys are good just to be good, main special person is main and special JUST because they needed someone to be so. You will see a lot of scenes ""inspired"" by old classics, but it feels like the creators didn't see any of them, relying on the movie poster to understand what those classics were all about. Imagine if all you knew about ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is that it's a movie where monkeys find an obelisk, and that's it. This movie doesn't borrow from years of quality cinema, it is a shallow attempt to pretend to be one of the cool kids.

Maybe you will like the movie if you're drunk or high.

5 February 2023,Dreadful,"Now, I must declare an interest. I'm a martial arts expert and kung fu movies do nothing for me - I see the fakery. The entire movie seemed to be a loop of the same fight scene. Boring.

The parellel universe has been done to death in other movies and no matter how bad they were, they were better than this.this.

It is the only film I have watched to the end and still hated - how did it get so many 10 star reviews???

I didn't care a jot about any of the characters, could care less how it ended or who won. Take this movie and remake it word for word, scene for scene, with unknowns and most would have given it a one star. The ratings are more for who is in it than the actual content. Dire, dire, dire.",3

22 May 2022,Every meme everywhere all at once,"As much as I enjoyed Michelle Yeoh's acting, the movie itself is no more interesting than a series of combined social media memes. It will appeal to a younger generation but the visuals were not for me and thus had no comedy quality. What was left then was an interesting storyline that would have been better off without the unnecessary goofy elements such as the bagel which for me ruined the entire movie and made it seem like it was trying too hard to be symbolic, accessible and popular. The underlying messages and references were nothing but a sweeping acceptance and self-acceptance thing. Not so much to think upon.

I found the opening scene to be much more promising when it stayed in the realm of realism which made the title less literal and the story somehow deeper. Being everywhere all at once with no time for yourself to figure out what is happening in your life is a great theme and a more realistic portrayal of the situation would have led to the same amount of absurdity, only maybe more subtle than what it turned out to be.",4
6 June 2022,Unbearable,"!

It was good for ten minutes. Then -- for the 1.5 hours I could bear it -- it was a procession of kung-fu fight scenes, scene after scene after scene after scene, merged with a really bad video game, written by a ten-year-old who stayed up for three nights by drinking several tank loads of coffee.

Truly unbearable.

11 July 2022,"Good ideas, very bad executed them. I wasted much my time","I wanted to wait until the end to see if it gots better, but I felt that I wasted much of my time, the movie is not worth it. Many people find it very interesting, but I cannot cherish most of it, only simple part of it.

10 March 2023,Nothing Nowhere Never!,"I watched the first fifteen minutes hoping that the film would become less unwatchable, but it never did - in fact the opposite was true. Equally offensive to eyes and ears, and full of characters to instantly dislike, I had no option but to quit before I wasted any more time on this truly awful film. I cannot understand the hype, the Oscar buzz, or the glowing reviews on this website - all of which are as unfathomable as this movie. A classic case of The Emperor's New Clothes, with the only saving grace being that I had not wasted any money on my aborted viewing. Do yourself a favour and avoid this movie like the plague!

18 March 2023,Not worthy of even being nominated for an Oscar,"Thought this might be worth a try given the number of Oscars its just picked up, however we gave up and turned off after enduring it for forty minutes, very confusing story line, total nonsense, with some very ridiculous scenes.

Plus as someone with hearing loss the dialogue was difficult to follow and I'm afraid I didn't feel the acting was any more than average either.

All Quiet on the Western Front was far more gripping and thought provoking and for entertainment value the Irish Goodbye and Top Gun were leagues ahead of this drivel.

If anything this has left me feeling disappointed for those who missed out on picking up an Oscar due to this very poor film, which shouldn't have even been nominated, getting in the way.

27 May 2022,The rating is misleading and it is a waste of time,"The movie pretends to be interesting but it is really meaningless. It is a mixture of random ideas without depth or any novelty. It is not funny as well. When the very first matrix came out was amazed by the novelty of the idea and it made you think because there was some coherent basis. This movie has no such aspect. It is really an insult to intelligence.

29 January 2023,Amateurish,"Quite possibly the stupidest movie I've seen in many years. It looks like it was made by a high school movie class. Silly special effects, low budget ""sci-fi"" props (2 Bluetooth headsets used together? Really?). I cannot for the life of me figure out why this is nominated for anything. Apparently this is ""the film"" this year. Really dumb.

From the outset of this movie I kept waiting for it to get interesting, the only thing I could think of throughout the movie was that the actor who played the grandfather was the same actor who played the manager of the Chinese restaurant in the famous Seinfeld Chinese restaurant episode. Every time he was on screen I kept hearing him say ""Cartwright?"" Unfortunate for him, I'm sure he's a talented actor.

Really, don't spend a dime to watch this. It'll be streamable for free soon enough. It's just bad.

31 May 2022,It's Like The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy Flick...,"...But without the catchy dolphin song.

The level of idiocy increases the further you get into the film to the level where you wonder why they didn't just make an animated movie designed to keep little kids entertained while their parents get a short break from family life.

Eye rolling ad nauseam.

27 January 2023,Very overrated,"While I do love stories involving the multiverse I found this one to be very fast paced, very weird and confusing.

It's on the order of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy with it's outrageous and nonsensical theme, only this one is somewhat more extreme.

The action sequences, and there are a lot, were great and the acting was good with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Guy Quan in the lead parts along with a very unrecognizable Jamie Lee Curtis, but to categorize this as an Academy Award contender just shows me how the Oscars are out of touch with so much when it comes to these action and science fiction films.

Don't listen to the critics and their high appraisal of the movie because they don't look at these like an everyday viewer and solely place their opinions on the artistic approach or the type of cast involved. I also have my doubts as to the high approval rating coming from the audiences.

But, don't take my word for it. Watch it for yourself and make your own judgement. Just be prepared to say that you want your 2 hours and 19 minutes back.",3
5 February 2023,Not for me,"I watched this after all the hype so maybe my expectations were too high, but this movie wasn't for me. I thought the acting was great and I did like the message of it, but it had too much going on without enough explanations and character development. It really is everything all at once and not in a good way. The concept of the multiverse and what was happening sometimes in scenes were not explained in a way to make everything conducive. I saw some reviews say the idea is kind of like the Matrix and I do agree a bit - full disclosure, I'm not a fan of the Matrix either. Maybe I just don't like these types of movies lol. I felt like I needed to be drunk or something to enjoy the ride to be honest.

4 February 2023,Chaotic,"I understand the message. Nice message hence two stars but the film is absurdly chaotic and more like a colorful circus performance than a superb film. I do not understand how this film can receive so many Oscar nominations! I am a movie buff and also studied film theory at University. This movie is a tornado of incoherence and you cannot wait until the tornado moves through so you can collect your thoughts after the storm. Reminds me of Symphony Fantastique by Berlioz, which was allegedly composed under the influence of drugs. However, Symphony Fantastique is actually an fascinating piece of Program music.

26 March 2023,Original? Yes. Deserving of best film? No.,"To say the least, the story does have a point. However, getting to it is an excruciating experience. If you're extremely disciplined, you might manage to get to the last thirty minutes or so, and realize that there is some decent content to be found. However, the first two-thirds of the movie will have many people walking out of the room, or simply turning the film off. Most of it is a well-edited, extremely confusing story which can best be described as an incoherent The Matrix. There are lots of colours, some good martial arts, and the feeling that everything possible is being thrown at the screen. However, it is neither dramatic nor funny. It is also neither compelling nor thought-provoking. It really is a pain in the ass to watch, and however acceptable the ending is, a viewer is still likely to feel as though he or she has wasted their time.

16 March 2023,Could have been way better than expected but this oscar winning is worst,"I didn't like it at all because the idea was amazing and they came to solve only mother-daughter husband issue with what I mean seriously!

It's also flashes so much at one point I had migraine and didn't wanted to continue so fast forward little bit and all. Acting was okay I feel not so great like oscar winning stuff what is wrong with them.

Story was flat line simple they could have solved this without other fuss. Please dont watch it or watch it at your own risk and please take a paracetamol or aspirin with you. This will surely gonna give a headache. Oscar you lost your reputation, get a life.

7 June 2023,Worthless,"Could not finish this meaningless travesty of a film. Shame on the Academy and others who praised and awarded this pointless waste of time. Oh so clever, jumping frenetically from one reality to another. Who cares? Does this really campare to Amadeus, or Out of Africa, or Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago or 2001 a Space Odyssey? Is it a wonderful story? Does it make you cry or laugh? Is the acting superb? Do you leave the theater uplifted and a better person for having wasted 2 hours? Is this the best that filmmakers can do in 2023? Terribly disappointed in this visual hodge podge of junk. You can have it!

14 March 2023,Had to trully push myself to watch it till the end.,"I wonder how much the level has fallen to have this title at the Oscars and even win some. The movie steps on on the idea of parallel universes, shifting minds and some action... which I don't mind, but the rest is just awful. The bottom was reached when they lost their com devices and decided that they have to stick objects in their asses to regain their super powers. Sorry, but this is on the level of movies like ""Scary Movie"". Though the last brings some laughter.

As conclusion, the film has a simple script based on some ideas of love, but with total inability to keep that message on rather than shooting the audience with bizarre scenes and action that jumps around full of meaningless ideas.

17 March 2023,So bad it makes me angry,"The utterly dismal state of cinema today is represented here in this charmless, frenetic, yet unwatchable piece of dross. There is not one award this has been given to this film that could be justified in any sane, civilised society. The first scene was quite watchable as the characters were introduced in a busy laundry run by Michelle Yeoh. Her life seems utterly out of control as so many elements of work and family collide. The customers like to hang out there and despite the family entanglements the laundry seems to have an important place in the community.

Then it all goes south when she visits the IRS. The remainder of the film is so breathtakingly confusing and lacking any kind of entertainment value.

Think a bucket of 'The Matrix' that has been emptied into a stroboscope.

19 March 2023,So much for so little,"This can't possibly be the best movie of the year. Yes, I know the Oscars rarely pick the best movie of the year but to choose this one they seem to have lost the plot.

It starts very well, basically until they go to the tax office and go into the parallel universe. From that moment on it's a fantasy movie full of nonsense characters and nonsense action scenes most of them Kung fu like that I don't buy, I don't understand, I don't follow.

Beautiful photography and settings but that's it. It had so much potential if they didn't go into the fantasy world after about the first 15 min.

Luckily I watched it at home and not in a cinema because it would have been embarrassing to be nodding off during the last hour of running time.

9 January 2023,"In some universe, this was a good movie. Just not in this one.","In some universe someone bothered to hire a writer to transform their random thoughts into a script.

And then an editor, who politely explained that you can't just throw your moodboard at viewers. Your acid trip isn't a finished movie.

And then a marketing team, who transferred the viewers from that universe to leave reviews in ours. That is unethical marketing practices and should be called out.

I didn't hate it as much as others, some parts were sort of cute, but so diluted in endless nonsense that in the end made it just a pretentious waste of time. There was nothing life-changing or thought-provoking, at least not beyond thoughts any functioning brain has dealt with by the age of 15.

There was hardly anything funny either. It just tried too hard to be shocking and deep and absurd, but it all stayed on the surface, without being willing to put in any work to create some substance underneath.",4
6 April 2023,Just really poorly done movie.,"I really wanted to like this movie. Didn't see it when it first came out. Heard raving reviews, saw the Oscar wins, thought it must be great! Then I started watching it, was painfully bored. Turned it off after 10-12 minutes. Was painful to watch. Then a few days later decided to give it another try... got maybe 30 minutes in and immediately wanted that 30 minutes of my life back. Was just really bad. Not interesting. Not realistic. Gave me no reason to continue watching. I didn't care about the movie, the story, the characters, nothing. Completely dumbfounded by its success. The back and forth between Chinese and English along with the on and off subtitles was very annoying. It was unique, I'll give it that, but in the worst ways. Honestly couldn't stand it.

Actors, producer, director, Oscars should be utterly ashamed of this mess of a film. Why 15 certificate should be 18, vile. Rubbish film, poor acting, the only thing that a good was my expectation of seeing a good film, after 15 minutes it was not to be. It is a grubby worst film ever. Astounded that a film this bad ever got to the screens let alone winning awards. The film industry need to smarten up. Never will I understand where all the good reviews came from; not had a problem with other highly reviewed films just this one. Avoid this film.

30 March 2023,One big headache,"The concept of multiple dimensions and parallel universes is overused but still they somehow made it that for the life of me i couldn't grasp the plot of this movie, The movie is a major disappointment from start to finish. While it had the potential to be an engaging and thrilling experience, it ultimately fell flat due to an incomprehensible plot and a predictable ending that left little room for surprise or excitement. The constant cuts and jarring transitions left me with a pounding headache and the feeling of disorientation. The editing choices seemed almost gratuitous, with rapid-fire cuts and dizzying camera movements that served no real purpose other than to create a sense of chaos. The result was a film that felt disjointed and overwhelming, leaving me feeling disoriented and unable to fully engage with the story, just waiting for the ending. One thing that cannot be denied though is the strength of the actors performances. Despite the challenges presented by the disjointed plot and dizzying editing, the cast delivered powerful and convincing performances that were truly captivating. In particular, Evelyn Wang deserve special recognition for her outstanding work. Her performances were nuanced, heartfelt, and incredibly moving, and she managed to elevate the film despite its many flaws.",3
20 May 2022,Calvyn Lee,"Not my type of movie. Perhaps I am not artistic enough to understand. Thumb down for this movie.

17 March 2023,Not worth the hype,"Decided to watch this after it won 7 oscars. The movie is messy, not interesting storyline. There is no story for most part, it just continues for 2.5 hrs without a storyline. Don't recommend anyone to watch.

The only differentiating thing is probably that no one has explored this kind of plot and movie. But that's not enough to make a good movie IMO. The last 30 mins just drag along and you wait for the movie to end.

I didn't understand why its being praised critically. It could have been more structured in its message and stuck to conveying 1 message. But sadly, that's not the case. Recommend to not watch.

This mad succession of consequence-free events, trains of activity which get cancelled by a switch to another parallel world, means that nothing is actually at stake, and the film becomes a formless splurge of Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time. Again, this film is much admired and arrives adorned with saucer-eyed critical notices ... I wish I liked it more.

Personally I couldn't wait for it to finally end and, when it finally, thankfully, did, reminded myself that, in future I'll only read the IMDb reviews after I've watched the film. Lesson learned.

26 January 2023,Ummm ......,"I bought a subscription to Showtime just to watch this since it's been hyped so much and I love JLC and Michelle Yeoh. I'm only an hour into the movie and I do not see what the hype was about. I'm going to finish it because my card was already charged the monthly fee but I don't have high hopes at all that it will suddenly be a great movie. I just had to pause the movie and come to the reviews cause I knew I couldn't be alone in thinking how absurd and just stupid this movie is.

Also, why is there a required character limit now to post reviews? I'm only typing out all this to fulfill it. DUMB!

18 March 2023,Pretentious,"I don't feel the urge to write a review very often, however, after watching this overly hyped nonsense I felt compelled to review. I don't think that I'm over forty years of watching movies I've seen something so pretentious. I'm convinced that once the hype has passed the rating for this film will fall significantly. How it managed to win so many Oscars is beyond me, especially supporting acting awards. I rarely feel the urge to stop watching a film once I've started to watch, but this film came as close as I've ever come to doing so. This is a classic case of style over substance and is spectacularly overrated.

I made it through maybe 40 minutes of the movie and I had to leave the room. I should have read reviews before spending $20 to watch this utterly chaotic and nonsensical movie. It begins slowly, and then erupts into bizarre, rapid fire scene changes.... I just didn't get it. I loved the actors in the movie and had high expectations that they would give me an awesome movie night experience. But, even the great Jamie Lee Curtis could not keep me from shaking my head and just walking away. Such a disappointment.

20 October 2022,Sensory overload!,"This movie about meaninglessness is, ironically, equally meaningless.

Except for tiny emotional touches of depth near the end about the only emotionally engaging thing in the film; the dysfunctional family relationships, dysfunctional family patterns and how to grow as a person and not be a heartless robot going through the monotony of a self-chosen way of life.

They should've kept to the story and cut out completely useless and nonsensical headache and seizure-inducing visuals.

I suggest watching Dirk Gently instead for way more fun (eeaao wasn't funny in the slightest Except with the rocks) and more meaningful craziness. Also Cloud Atlas.

13 February 2023,Seriously,"Was hopeful that this would be another solid vehicle for Michelle Yeoh. Was hopeful that this would be a thought provoking venture and kind of sci-fi.

Unfortunately it was neither. I watched it in a flight, but I'm pretty sure that's the only reason I watched it to the end. I had a feeling that the producers and directors were have a bit of a laugh to see what they could get past the audience.

Frenetic, hard to watch. I fully accept the martial arts aspect of it and how that arises and fits within the Chinese genre / idiom, but it did feel a lot like Kung Fu Hustle. At least that movie was honest. I am completely bemused how the movie community can allocate a range of significant nominations for this movie.

30 July 2022,Uhhh ... no,"I think this was supposed to be entertaining. Instead, the chucklheads who came up with this disassociation come on camera ... before their movie ... giggling about how many times everyone has supposedly seen the film. Let me put it simply. I'd rather tear off each of my fingernails, one by one, than watch this movie again. Maybe it had potential at some point. Until the same ""verse jump"" theme is played over for the 35th time and you're wondering how, during filming, that the actors weren't slamming speedballs on top of 5ths of Vodka to stay sane. Maybe they did have unlimited Peruvian flake for the cast and crew. That might explain things. 30 minutes in, I was done. I was seriously contemplating standing up in the theater and screaming something unhinged about 1.5 hours in.

Then I looked at the online reviews. I feel like my heart has been forcibly removed from my chest and my eyes have been pierced with ice picks. WTAF is wrong with people??

12 March 2023,Too long,"Did this sci-fi-comedy/family-drama (there's a new category, huh?) have an editor? Two hours and nineteen minutes of exhausting images relentless thrown at the viewer is way too much. There is no repose. I found that it has to be taken in 20-minute chunks. This could have been a reasonable 90-minute film. It could even be a very good 30-minute short. At 139 minutes, it's excruciating. And it's nominated for a bunch of Oscars? The premise is simple and accurate: 1. Whatever life you're stuck with is better with an unconditionally loving, kind partner and 2. If you have a LGBTQ kid, be supportive or you'll mess them up.

14 July 2023,Overrated and loses direction,"Ok so yes a lot of the reviews on here are right, I have no idea why this film was so highly rated by the academy. It was probably political, and some of the performances weren't that outstanding (JL Curtis in particular).

I feel that despite its efforts to be groundbreaking it's neither that new (other films have handled the whole multiple universe thing better) nor deep (the tedious interaction between Jobu and Evelyn was meant to make us think...but it was trite and shallow and overly obvious).

It's a film of two halves, which is done on purpose, and it starts off excitingly - there's a baddie and a goodie and one has to prevail. A good amount of people die at the hands of Jobu. She's cruel and unforgiving. Sets it up nicely. Unfortunately in the second half the whole thing unravels, it gets lost and slightly preachy and also the humour just doesn't work. The ending is saccharine, and left me feeling...meh. What about all the innocent dead people? It's as if they ran out of ideas and went for the easiest option which again is not very groundbreaking. Just the usual Hollywood fare but with some good fight scenes because of the actors involved.",4
30 May 2023,What is all the fuss about?,"How did this become such a success? I really don't get it. It is a cheap Chinese B movie with a plot that I could predict after a few minutes. In the end it was not even a dream, this was suppososed to be real. A 2D sketched universe, yeah right. A good actor can make me forget who she really is, but Michelle Yeoh did not do that for me, so why the Oscar, beats me. I found the dougther Joy more convincing. Jamie Lee Curtis was acting good, but sadly way over the top becoming some kind of zombie some times. The grandpa was the worst actor in there. Waymond and Michelle Yeoh did not show chemistry for me, not even as a married couple. The only thing funny was the scene with the Rocks, the rest was just absurdidty. You will miss nothing if you did not watch this movie.

All in all, my advice to fellow movie buffs would be to ditch the remote for this one and go and find your local coffee house and have a latte and brownie instead!!

7 January 2023,Well that was weird,"I think I am in the minority when it comes to my thoughts about this movie. As at the time of reviewing this (movie), it had an IMDB score of 8.1 (Jan 2023). I gave it 5 stars, and I was being generous at that.

For me, the story was confusing, with only limited spots of action here and there. But overall, it's not an easy movie to follow, and was disappointed for the reason given why all the caos is happening. Its saving grace is the suberb cast. The movie is well acted (it's why I gave it 5 stars), but the story pace is all over the place. Very slow in the beginning, then fast, then slow, then even more slow. Some great action when it happened, but nothing new that we haven't seen before, and they (action) come far and few in-between. The interaction between the characters is not great neither. There is no chemistry with all of them. Although it was good to see ""Data"" and ""Short-Round"" (aka Ke Huy Quan), all grown up.

I really wanted to like this movie, but in the end it just left me confused, and the journey to my confusing wasn't really as entertaining as I would have hoped.

VERDICT: If you're a fan of Michelle Yeoh and like multi-verse type movies, then this could be your cup of tea.",5
25 July 2023,Worst movie ever...seriously.,"This was such a horrible movie, I don't even know where to start. My sister and I stopped the movie about 1/4 of the way through, and I have literally NEVER done that.

It was a complete hot mess. I love Michelle Yeoh - fantastic actress - but this movie was beyond bad. I had heard so much hype about it and couldn't wait to watch, but it was the most disappointing movie. My sister and I were trying to think if we had ever watched such a bad movie, and we couldn't think of any movie this bad. So, it receives the WORST MOVIE award ever, from both of us. Just....blegh!! Don't waste your precious time watching this film.

14 August 2022,I can sort of see why people like this,"The plot sounds like something I'd really enjoy. But it just felt drawn out. Half the movie is in the tax office. If I read the plot I would understand why people seem to universally love it, but I think my expectations were too high that I felt like they could've done so much more with the concept instead of most of the movie showing a series of fight scenes before you really understand why they are fighting.

16 June 2022,"INCREDIBLE IDEA, POORLY TOLD","What a waste of talents, potential and ideas. The concept of the story is actually wonderful, but they spoiled it while trying to make some comedy of it, missing the target by far!

The outcome was a mess!

But Ok, congratulations on the idea.

Next time, leave the supposedly funny part out of the script!

You're definitely not good at that!

29 March 2023,Utter nonsense,"I'm disappointed to see one of my favourite actresses working so hard in this awkward and non sensical film. Michelle Yeoh is great, but this conglomeration of ridiculous ideas is just vomit inducing. The storyline is pretty weak and jumps all over the place. The cheesy dialogue is horrible.

The premise is good and could have accomplished something that was inspiring and meaningful, instead, it seems like a film that's trying to be quirky just for the sake of it...

I wanted to turn it off half way through but also wanted to see if it got better. It didnt, however, and now I feel like I've wasted an evening..

3 January 2023,Not my cup of tea.,"I am still puzzled by the number of people that give this film such high ratings. I watched the movie with the expectation that it was a great film but a third of the way through I just wanted it to end or just fast forward it to see where it was going. But no, regretfully, i watched the the whole thing, hoping there would be some revelation. Yes, some of the acting is good, but at the end of this too long movie, I left with nothing, not caring for any of the poorly developed characters. There are so many great movies with the same premise, fast action scenes (the fights) and good acting but this one fails in everything and everywhere!

28 February 2023,Popcorn-TikTok-Absurd movie,"I absolutely do not understand how you can seriously evaluate this popcorn-tiktok-absurd movie for acting, etc. Well, except for the editing and costumes. I don't mean it's a bad movie. This is a good movie for once. I have a feeling that there are 15 years old teenagers of Marvel fans sitting in the film academy, who, in addition, are also preoccupied with various types of perversions. Are you seriously? What's wrong with you? You just spit on the entire history of cinema. You are losing respect for yourself. It feels like you haven't watched the movies before at all. If you think that toilet humor is worthy of an award, then I feel sorry for you. Create a separate award for such movies. Don't touch history. It's not professional at least.

5 March 2023,"So, So Bad","Parallel universes, flaccid plotting, over long, poor acting, jokes that don't land, and massive hype. There is so much to dislike about this film. At some point, when all the noise around award nominations and wins has died down, people will step back and take a cooler analytic look at this film and recognise it for what it is: ill structured nonsense. Yeoh, Quan, Hsu, Curtis.etc. Can't be blamed for the mess for they are just fitting into that the director/writers have constructed. Watch the trailer, and if you have even the slightest reservations, don't subject yourself to the whole 2hr 19m debacle. Stupidly I didn't follow my instinct and let someone persuade me to watch this. Oh, but the regret. This film is so, so bad.

18 March 2023,Ridiculous,"It appears that the makers of this movie wanted to take a shortcut to success. It is customary in arts to bend the rules, or amend the customs. This seems to appeal to critics. What the makers or Everything, Everywhere, All at once seem to have missed is that you need to learn the rules, and perhaps prove that, before you break them. The mediocre acting and inferior story-telling of this movie are best described as someone who paints for the first time in their life, and calls that surrealism.

The movie attempts to associate itself with thoughtfulness when it talks, plainly, about how little we are in this universe, when it addresses the importance of not letting go of your loved ones, and when it encourages people to love and appreciate their lives as it is. However, it all seems forced upon the two meaningleas hours before that.

2 February 2023,Chinese Matrix Meets Legion (not in a good way),"Ow! My head!

This movie is WAY too confusing. It's as if someone had an ok concept for a 30-min TV show (Love, Death, and Robots) and stretched it to over 2 hours. It was entirely too long which added to the confusion. There were numerous extraneous characters (grandfather, big nose, etc) that they tried to build up, but ultimately failed because there wasn't enough time. And the fight scenes were confusing because they were meant to be confusing to add to the story.

The ONLY reason this is up for Best Picture at the Oscars is because it's Chinese. Chinese actors, Chinese writer, Chinese director, Chinese stereo types (laundry). The Chinese have bought Hollywood and now are buying awards.

Take your money and get drunk. Your hangover will feel the same, but at least you had fun getting there.",3
9 May 2023,I didn't like the movie at all,"From the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to like this, despite really trying to. I'm 19 years old but this movie went way too fast in different languages and with so many multiverse switches so fast and by the end I had no idea why anything was happening, why I should care or what I was supposed to feel. I felt nothing and I was happy when it was over. I watched a different movie then everyone who gave it a 6 or higher I think. I do reaaally appreciate the effort it must have taken to make this movie especially with the editing but overall I just really wanted to like it and was disappointed by it, hated it even.

Everyone sees it clearly. Plenty of films like that we wish not to waste time on.

But we should not concentrate on this particular one as much as on the Academy Award committee. Those people are responsible for promoting lack of quality. If it is a political decision - okay, I can understand it.

Otherwise any Oscar nomination for Everything Everywhere All at Once makes the Asian community really embarrassed. The Asian cinematography is proud of many fantastic productions that have past unnoticed. And you choose EEAAO just to take the piss out of Asia.

11 March 2023,Popcorn; leave your brain at the entrance,"In my opinion it's like a Tarantino: very well executed, very well acted, very well directed, very well photographed, funny, but completely devoid of any semblance of an interesting or worthy world view. I had fun up to the middle and then I stopped caring -- it became completely boring when I realized they had nothing solid to say.

The philosophy defended in the story is just awful. A work of art, especially a sci-fi comedy such as this, requires a layer of meaning, which here is so wrong that I am not being unfair in considering it totally missing.

140 minutes that should either have been only 70 or turned into something worthy, instead of self-indulging in dirty jokes.

I am not a religious person; it's just that if you think about the one-sentence moral of the story, you quickly realize it's nonsense.

If you are looking for a sci-fi comedy, you are better off watching ""Back to the Future"" again, and there's no way this is as worthy of that, or worthy of all the praise. I predict everyone will have forgotten this film very soon.",3

It was boring. I love Jamie Lee Curtis and her scenes were great and at times very funny but everything else about this movie just didn't work. Yes I understood the message. No it didn't go over my head. It just wasn't that clever. It was an average movie that dragged and had me watching the clock. Definitely utterly amazed that it's won best picture. (Watch The Banshees of Inisherin instead. That's clever movie making). I should add my husband enjoyed this movie so clearly there's an audience for it somewhere (not everywhere all at once tho) but I wouldn't recommend.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is essentially the rebirth of Kung Pow: Enter the Fist. Twenty years later, without humor, and lacking the self-deprecation of Kung Pow. At least Kung Pow knew what it aspired to be.

30 May 2023,Totally garbage interpretation of the multiverse,"What a load of unwatchable nonsense. This movie pretends to explore the concept of a multiverse, but it is nonsense. It is completely implausible that a new universe is birthed every time any individual makes a decision, as there are billions of people who continually make decisions that seem trivial at the time they are made that change everything downstream. Even worse is that the alternative multiverses contain key elements that defy evolution - for an alternate reality to exist, it would still have to make sense. If you want to watch something that has something real to say, watch Beef and skip this garbage.

Insult to class movies from 2022 such as 'No Time to Die' and 'Top Gun Maverick' which should have won Oscars just for their closing credits compared to this senseless movie.

Michelle's acting was great but what a total waste of talent. Her fight scenes were good but that was it. It amazes me that it won 7 Oscars and as such I will now associate more Oscars wins with more reasons to avoid watching movies. There was nothing 'deep' about this movie. Just a mish mash of random scenes of absolute brain cell obliterating garbage.

I wish I could get that 2+ hours of my life back. I can't. But you can-avoid this at all costs. You'd happily rather watch paint dry I can assure you.

31 January 2023,The Oscars are a joke,"Seven Oscars for this? A confused mess of a movie that is way too long, tries to be too clever and rewards people that don't really deserve it. I don't think anyone would seriously begrudge Michelle Yeoh the Oscar for best actress but the simple fact is that Cate Blanchett should have won for 'Tar'. I like Jamie Lee Curtis but was this an Oscar winning performance? Not in my opinion.

If there was one Oscar that was truly deserved it was for editing and there is no doubt that it is superb in this movie. But overall this most definitely did not deserve to clean up the way it did, hell I even hit the fast forward button as I was bored to tears towards the end. Over hyped and overrated.

From the plot to the acting to the frantic directing to the unfortunate attempts at humor in the writing, it was a complete flop. I really don't understand where it received any awards.

I think that the multiverse is a real interesting concept and the attempt to draw the viewer into it was the right theory. But it didn't come across well at all. The characters weren't anyone I cared about nor felt compelled to support. The larger fight that they were supposed to save didn't make you appreciate the weak, unfortunate characters that they were.

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

27 March 2023,Worst movie ever!,"I can't believe this movie won so many academy awards! It is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and that is not only my opinion it's the same opinion as the three other people who watched the movie with me! Thankfully i didn't pay to watch this absolute piece of trash of a movie! Halfway through this movie i kept looking at my watch wondering when this is going to end! The movie is just plain horrible and unbearable to watch! At the end the four of us couldn't believe what we just watched and all of us agreed it was the worst 2+ hours of our lives that we'll never get back. Don't waste your time watching this filth!

13 March 2023,This won best picture Total BS,"This won over top gun and avatar for best picture give me a break Hollywood just doesn't get it anymore... Top Gun and Avatar saved the movie industry post pandemic and they award this steaming pile of garbage the best highest honor award.....Sorry but don't waste your time with this movie it's awful and thats putting it politely. I'd have given it no stars if I could. The story is all over the place and it's just plain bad I didn't even finish it and I've watched some pretty bad movies in its entirety..I honestly thought the Oscar was the best of the best of the best but honestly anyone can win one now.

13 March 2023,Nothing Nowhere Never,"Could be the most overrated and under preforming movie I've ever attempted to enjoy. A juvenile portrayal of life's challenges. A typical Hallmark inspired movie plot reimagined in a delusional drug fueled haze.

Obvious self taught special effects are comical, but not in a funny or entertaining way.

When the writers also direct the movie ,there is a tendency to go ploughing through the script full speed ahead, whether it works or not.

I found this movie unwatchable. I enjoy good science fiction. I enjoy good portrayals of alternative universes or interconnected multiverses, unfortunately this has neither.

For whatever reasons the reviews are amply peppered with 9s and 10s. I know I watched the same movie as they did, but I guess I decided to review on it's over all merit rather than a bunch sight gags and badly veiled references, although the Ratatouille reference was a high point. Can not recommend on any level. My condolences to all competitors who lost an award to it.",1
7 March 2023,Too Much! Everywhere All At Once!,"I consider myself to have a pretty open mind when it comes to film but this was just too much! Is all the hype surrounding this movie Hollywood's attempt to be more inclusive?

Too bad Crazy Rich Asians, which actually had a storyline, wasn't recognized with a few more Oscars nominations a few yrs back.

Yes. Every decision we make alters our lives forevermore and puts us in an alternative universe but WOW! Sensory overload!

I appreciate the overall message and theme of the film - Be loving and kind and be grateful for what you have. Accept life as it is. Not what it could have been.

Everything, Everywhere All At Once in my opinion is a BOMB!

26 August 2023,"Tedious, uninteresting","The makers had a thought like:

'Hey, how badass would be a trailer look with a lady punching her way through different lives?' ""Tight, but what's the story?"" 'Am sure we can contrive something'.

They couldn't. The film is disconnected, it fails to create any tone right from the beginning. One doesn't empathize with the protagonist. One doesn't feel the urgency when she's said to be in danger and one doesn't feel thrill when she starts fighting. Leave alone the lackluster 'theory'. I spent a freaking 45 minutes, trying to connect with it, finally gave up on it and felt like I should warn others to save their time.

17 March 2023,"No, never ever an Oscar movie","Given I have watched this movie after a long (I'm in Europe) and sleepless Oscar night, but I doubt this has risen my expectations too high to be fair. Based on a very simplistic view at the concept of multiverses and stuffed with every personal problem a family encounters nowaday, fast editing, some fair actors and few cheap visual tricks fail to cover a flat script.

Everything is connected in some way to everything and husbands and daughters aren't much help if you cannot cope with your own demons, but can anybody tell me, why this movie is worth over 2 hours of my own life? Even the first half of Monty Pythons 'Meaning of Life' offers more insights, fun and katharsis than this overlong, overstuffed and overrated roller-coaster ride into the emptiness of life, without even realizing that this movie is part of the problem it apparently tries to find a solution to.

Even a 'box of chocolates' give me more entertainment than this doughnut and I didn't even like other movie.",5
14 March 2023,[3.5] Butts and sausages,"A horrible, nonsense and nonsensical movie with near zero and sub zero everything, refrigerating and freezing viewers minds with utter trash mumbo jumbo and that is a disgrace to the mumbo jumbo expression and meaning.

How it managed to win so many ""fields"" in the Oscars is just mind numbing, completely baffling and in my opinion just showing corrosion and downgrade, year by year of what once was a hallmark of standard, quality, deep thinking and marvelousness in the motion pictures (industry).

Though i very much like Korean productions, but this one is just good for a stoned pastime played at 1.8x lightning speed.

9 June 2022,Overhyped,"I went to see it because of the hype and reviews like ""near flawless movie"". I found this film to be boring, predictable, silly and unoriginal.

To me there were too many parallels to The Matrix: Jumping between the worlds, regular people turning into ""agents"", downloading skills, love will save everything, etc..

The childish fraternity-style sexual humor was not funny and seemed unnecessary.

Switching between English and Mandarin was annoying. I get it. They are family of immigrants, so thick accent explains it fully. Why do you need to switch to Mandarin with English subtitles? It's distracting.

.Way below expectations.

17 March 2023,Ridiculous overrated mess,"This film is a grossly overrated , disjointed , boring giant meandering mess. It has a weak plot with no significant character development . I Watched most all of it to give it a chance and I can't find anything that worked other than maybe the special effects . I'm at a complete loss as to how this film could hold anyone's interest . If wasn't interesting , coherent, fun, or funny. Yiu can't tell whether they intend to be serious or funny or if it's just a very bad attempt at a black comedy . Either way it doesn't work and mid way through , you just don't care about the story or the characters and at that point even the special effects become as annoying as the actors and the bad dialogue. This film just went nowhere very slowly and very painfully .

14 March 2023,Seriously???,"I turned the movie off three times before I made it to the end on the fourth try. What the heck was that? This was pretty much torturous to watch. Is this what the Oscars have come to? Simply produce the strangest, offbeat movie you can imagine. The Academy will see it as art and award it regardless of how inane the storyline. One thing that I did try to focus on was the acting performances. I didn't find that either Jamie Lee Curtis or Michelle Yeoh had enough dialogue to be considered for any 'best of' awards. For the most part the movie spends a good amount of time between scenes with no dialogue, just a good amount of siezure inducing flashbacks. Not recommended!!!

30 August 2022,Wannabe Philosophers,"This movie is around average, I really couldn't connect to the main plot. It uses some exaggerated multiverse concept that none can actually understand, inorder to try to solve a family crisis. The jokes are pretty awful, idk maybe they'll be funny in another universe ü§î

I think most of the high reviews are from people who want to think that they are some big shot philosophers who have just witnessed a movie about the infinite multiverse, which apparently (according to the movie) the same infinite multiverse can fit in a floating donut.

I really wanted to like this movie, and to be true, it's an experience. I won't advice against watching it but if you do watch it, make sure there's lot of popcorn and be prepared for shallow jokes and ton of weirdness.

Good luck !",1
14 March 2023,Not even mushrooms made this enjoyable,"I was on mushrooms watching this and still had a terrible time. Why all the acclaim for this asinine production? Take notes, film students: You, too, can win all of the awards if you include allll the things! Do you like peach cobbler? Make an entire set dedicated to peach cobbler! You can have peach cobbler chairs and peach cobbler clothes and-no wait! Now you should suck everyone into a new setting altogether because creative whiplash is cool now! We might revisit peach cobbler later for no reason, but now let's focus on horse racing where the protagonists are the horses, and the jockeys are pterodactyls (but, like...in a sad way). The creative direction here was akin to having someone scream in my face about 100 different topics while flashing a nearly continuous strobe of various colors for 2h 19m. I can only imagine this what it's like to be in the mind of a completely psychotic individual. The acting was good in that it was chaotic and ranged the spectrum of emotions, but that's all I got in terms of praise. This movie threw spaghetti at the wall in every possible way: costumes (You don't like bagel hair? Well how about hot dog fingers!); setting (Don't get too attached to the laundromat idea, because we're about to spend an insane amount of time looking at rocks in silence); themes (Love? No, betrayal! Actually, revenge! Sorry, it really was love...but then shame. Also fear. And of course there's the recurring you-can-do-anything-as-long-as-you-have-a-Bluetooth-earpiece-no-one-has-used-in-two-decades). I can't believe how much praise this is garnering. I'm just a millennial, but I really hope this kind of film doesn't become the norm. Watch Casablanca and then watch this, and tell me we're headed in the right direction.",3
19 March 2023,"chaotic, confusing, exaggerated, weak plot, incomprehensible, poor character development, forced dialogues, unbelievable, clich√©, messy.","This film is a perfect example of chaotic storytelling, with a disjointed and often confusing plot that leaves viewers struggling to follow along. The pacing is frantic, and the sheer amount of over-the-top action sequences only serves to further muddle the narrative. The storyline is weak and far from engaging, and the lack of proper character development makes it difficult to invest in any of the on-screen personalities.

The dialogues feel forced and contrived, with many clich√©d lines that detract from the overall experience. The film's relentless chaos detracts from any meaningful emotional or thematic exploration, ultimately making it an exhausting watch. Despite its ambitious premise, this film fails to deliver on multiple fronts, earning a disappointing 4 out of 10 rating.

18 March 2023,"Sometimes the ""Academy"" is very wrong","Learning that this film won 7 Oscars at the academy and it stared Jamie Lee Curtis we thought this is going to be good. We settled in for a 2 hour and 20 minute treat. Starts off about as manic as a movie can get, I sat thinking what am I missing ? I can't get into this, it won 7 awards. I began to lose interest by the 30 minute mark. By the time we were 40 minutes in my wife says, I have no idea what's going on. Relief struck as I surely thought it was just me. She says to me, I can't watch this, my feelings were mutual and with one click of a button we made this rubbish disappear and agreed that the Academy truly has no credibility.

11 February 2023,Complete disaster,"This movie combines The Matrix ( very good), 12 Monkeys (excellent) , Eternal Sunshine of The spotless Mind (masterpice) and Tennet ( also disaster) and puts it into the blender to create an unwatchable spree of nonsense. It tries to be funny in places but fails horribly. The over-acting completes the mess. We turned it off after an hour of waiting for some turn to make it worthwhile to keep on watching, but it only deteriorated into more misery. Strange hat this complete chaos manages to score an 8 on IMDB and is candidate for several awards. I wonder if I saw something completely different or that I had to wait for the end of the movie to move up my score wit 4 points. Or, maybe my signal was scrambled.

18 March 2023,Total Garbage,"I'm 63 years old, and watched this movie based on it winning Picture of the Year. Warped minds but this drivel together. I am embarrassed for Hollywood to recognize this as a work of art. If I could give this movie rating a negative #, I would. Don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this.

The science fiction effects were disjoint, made no sense, and were arbitrarily glued together. The entire premise of being able to get along and accept others' ways could have been summed up in about 10 minutes. The movie industry continues to get more and more abstruse and rewards efforts of the deranged, imo. Sorry, hugely disappointed.

11 November 2022,Disappointed & OVERRATED,"Such a mess, awkward, waste of time movie .. I tried to give it a chance but I didn't understand anything the whole movie, it is very strange the rating is high!!!!! I didn't laugh or enjoy watching although i was waiting till the end mybe i understand something but it was so complicated and unclear, i feel like this movie was made to transfer hidden messages only with no appropriate scenario or clear script.. i wish if it started slowly then the action part starts so we could watch the rest 2 hours with passion

In my opinion, the idea itself doesn't worth to make a whole movie to discuss such an issue, what a joke .. With this professional production you could make better movie and interesting story ..

NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!!

2 August 2022,Off the rails ... and into the ditch,"Although the first 30 minutes of this movie was quite compelling and showed much promise, the remainder of the film consisted of senseless vignettes that failed to engage me and included various attempts at humor which were often in poor taste, if not outright disgusting. Eventually, it became an embarrassment to watch.

Did I understand the plot? Yes. Was it easy to follow? Yes.

A movie like this begs to be watched multiple times, to discover the hidden gems inside (think, for example, of Mulholland Drive). Unfortunately, I could not bear to watch Everything Everywhere All At Once a second time, let alone a 3rd, 4th, or 5th viewing.

29 January 2023,Everything except a story and everywhere but an ending,"Actually started strong and was pretty original first Act. Michelle Yeoh is always strong I thought this was definitely her best role in a decade but once we got to about the halfway mark it turned and by the third act it was completely off the rails. Another example of style over substance and leaning on the special effects and martial arts choreography. It was fun seeing ""short round"" all grown up but he was pretty flat, he had a couple moments but not enough to win me over. Worst role I've ever seen Jamie Lee Curtis in and the actress that played the daughter not dynamic, seemed like she was way out of her element. Pretty alarming that a film this bad has been nominated for this many Oscars. This is how far we fallen In our film going expectations, If ""the room"" was released now it would probably have about five nominations.

28 November 2022,And everything and everywhere all again and repeat...,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is undeniably awesome in its payoffs, but it just really isn't good at building those up. In this movie, Michelle Yeoh travels around the multiverse, looking at her different lives. Scenes often get thoroughly climatic, like the one where Yeoh's character bursts through all the different lives she lives in the multiverse. The way it was shot, with all the color flying before our eyes, was so adrenaline-pumping that I wanted to leap out of my seat and cheer. But the movie is rapidly losing its magic when this kind of scene is played for about the hundredth time. We have to go to all the universes again. Imagine my exhaustion.

""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a fair description of the movie's pacing. Scenes overwhelm us with flashes and blasts. Once in a while, Michelle Yeoh would showcase her performance when the script required her to give a heartfelt speech. Those are touching for the first time, not so much for the twentieth.

A big selling point is the martial arts in the movie. Yeoh is obviously an expert, but the fights themselves don't get better than a Jackie Chan movie. I found them maybe too choreographed, and I didn't get the use of extreme slow-mo. The moves are predictable; when a bad guy raises a fist towards our protagonist, we already know that she will block it, and make a counter-attack. And so on.

I do get why the story is so beloved: The protagonist doing taxes is a fairly clever idea, except a tax office is too bland of a place to have half your movie take place in. I struggle to take the whole multiverse aspect seriously. Everytime there is a smart idea, the spotlight of it gets stolen by a joke. Example: The backstory of the villain involves them experiencing every universe, every life all at once, but unimpressed by what they encountered. They decide to destroy everything with...a giant bagel. And this whole villain arc is solved by...that's right, another heartfelt speech. I acknowledge the creativity and craft behind Everything Everywhere All at Once, but I don't really buy its structure.",5

The actors are some of my favourites but what we're they thinking , I can't believe the hype around this film , I've read some reviews and a lot of people have given it awesome reviews and some have given it really bd reviews, it's like marmite, u either love ot or hate it, nothing in between.

Sprinkled with Chinese martial art, what's the message? Gay rights? Multiculturalism? The good against the evil. I can't believe this movie is nominated for the Oscar of best movie; it's ludicrous. Bad script, bad acting, bad sets, bad effects, bad costumes; this movie as all wrong and I can't believe I wasted my time on that lemon. And i still have to write 123 characters! How painful! And it's supposed to be funny; you know the kind of humour you find in cheap TV soaps in the afternoon. Hope the academy will not fall for this. Yeah, its a melting pot but the result is lame.

But then it turns into a madness of effects, hilarious setups and fighting scenes that is a love or hate.

I do like action movies, when done right, but no - when each action turns into is a matter of doing disgusting stuff to change to a world where you can learn.

It turned out to be nonsense and off putting in 3the degree.

I love comedy, but no where here the effects used to make a situation ""funny"" worked. I did not laugh at all.

21 May 2022,Handbook for filmmaking that forgot to add a plot,"This was two-plus hours of how-to vignettes on how to add razzle-dazzle to your film. Pick and choose which one will work for YOUR film!

Like....

Here, have her move down the aisle at light speed in her chair. Wow! Pretty neat!

Here, have her relocate - again at light speed! - to another universe and, yeah, track the universes on a cell-phone screen with pixels left over from PacMan. Cool!

Here, a sex toy! Use it somehow! Cool!

Oh wait, need some faux philosophy. Let's use something my kid wrote during therapy. Cool, just cool.

Then they realized that with all these vignettes that you too(!) can insert into your film that they needed a plot. So naturally have it all happen at a laundromat! Continuity!

Ok, Everything team, you really do know how to film gimmicky scenes.

So I know exactly what this is. It's a Filming Gimmicky Scenes documentary.

5 February 2023,Everything is Too Much,"I listen to a film podcast The Filmcast (great show) where the hosts actively avoid using the word ""pretentious"" when describing a film. I generally agree with their view on not using the adjective, since it rarely describes the movie and often short shrifts its content. This time, however, I must say I find it very difficult not to use this word in describing Everything Everywhere All at Once; the title of the movie already begs for the adjective, after all.

I found this movie to be extremely boring and opportunistic, while at the same time it was trying way too hard to be inventive. There is a fake ending at around the half point of the film, which was a cruel joke. After that scene, the film seemed to drag on even worse. The technical directing, on the other hand, was masterful. Unfortunately, beautiful moving images aren't enough to keep me entertained.

How this got 7 oscars I would never know. Most overrated movie ever. You know those Christmas movies which are being produced with a budget of 5 bucks and never make even to theaters? Well normally I cannot watch them as I find them too cheesy, until the moment when I realized I would rather watch 100 of those in a row, than continue this pain called everything, everywhere. Glad to see that there are people enjoying it, definitely not one of them. If you insist to watch anything in this line, id recommend memwnto.

Too many parts of the movie that leaves you wondering - was that really necessary. Some real unnecessary parts of the movie

Keep it clean - no need for cussing or foul language No need to make it rater R if it about family and love

Always hard to watch when there are things in a movie that does not add to the meaning of the movie.

Lucky, I borrowed it from the library so I did not spend any money on this movie. Heard about the awards and finally decided to watch it but I never was going to watch it because it looked so weird and now I know it is weird and not worth the time I spent on it.",1
10 September 2023,What is that?,"Only made it 45 minutes in and it started so slow I nodded off for awhile. What an excruciating experience. Just a hot mess of nothing even remotely appealing. Every time something switched I cringed. I've never seen anything so horribly ridiculous. What in the world could the members of the academy have been thinking when the even nominated this garbage, much less give it awards???? I just wanted a scene that made sense to play out and not keep jumping all over the place. Finally, I just didn't even care. I couldn't grab the remote control fast enough. Who ever wrote this must have been on a weird mixture of drugs. I absolutely hated it. That stupid movie about the end of the world, I think it was called ""The End""...terrible movie and if given a choice of watching it or this one, I'd choose The End in hot minute I want my 45 minutes back.

16 April 2023,Nothing Nowhere Stop,"I don't think this is worth your time. This is too weird. I didn't care for it at all and I do like Sci Fi movies. The acting is wonderful, but the plot is so difficult, weird, and hard to follow. The movie follows a barely speaking English speaker who suddenly and complely embraces her superpowers with few questions asked, and speaks English perfectly. I thought Inception was a challenge... well meet EEAAO. There were a couple of scenes that made this not recommendable to any of my friends, sorry producers. Some people still have morals. I don't ever want to see this again. I now understand why nobody I know has commented on it.

28 May 2022,Sentimental psychodelia: powerful but partially ruined.,"It has to be said that, for all its originality, it's still the same three-act movie Hollywood has been making for decades, the only one they'll ever make, this time spiced up with sentimental chinese psychedelia. A24 is still part of the industry. But, for a moment, it really is fresh, fast and fun. Michelle Yeoh is a star, the action is great and there's one of the funniest scenes I've ever witnessed on a screen.

Some very strong film-making. However, at one point, the film disintegrates. First, it struggles with the task of actually explaining what's going on, and suffers from it. Next, it struggles to maintain an ever-increasing momentum, throwing at the viewer, well, everything all at once. Like making a cocktail with everything at the bar, nothing sticks, it becomes something on your screen for a period of time (sorry). And yet, some occurrences, such as the raccoon, are still absolutely irresistible.

My main issue is in the end it shifts priorities, it becomes worried about being taken seriously as a thoughtful piece of drama with pseudo-philosophical musings. That hurts the film immensely. I was disappointed, checking my watch, wondering why this movie suddenly was trying to over-explain basic human emotions. I guess a big part of the audience needs to be reminded of what makes them human. I'm ok with it, though, I'm not going to complain about a possitive message, the problem is there is so much noise the emotional climax is non-existent, or maybe I was numb.

Of course, as expected, there is a subtext of criticism of the Chinese family, supposedly severe, diligent and demanding, contrasted with the permissiveness, communication and affection of the ""new"" American family. The daughter is eventually the one being right, conveniently English-speaking.

It will undoubtedly be one of the most powerful films to come out of USA in a few years, it's got everything to please today's film fauna. I enjoyed the first half greatly and I personally hope it soon establishes itself as the best multiverse film because that would mean no more are made.",5
1 June 2022,"As ambitious as the title suggests, this surreal philosphical morality-tale is so complicated it's perplexing.","In ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" Michelle Yeoh's an inner-city laundromat owner bogged by: dad James Hong's birthday party; hubbie Ke Huy Kwan wanting a divorce; daughter Stephanie Hsu wanting independence; & tax auditor Jamie Lee Curtis doing her job. But when an alternate universe cuts sharply in she sees limitless alternate versions of all these (and herself) waging often violent battles rooted in questions like 'What's the point?' & 'Will love conquer all?'. Co-director / co-writers Dan Kwan & Daniel Scheinert sure were ambitious with this surreal philosphical morality-tale, but too much so - being so complicated as to be perplexing.

12 April 2023,When does it get good?,"We watched about 30 minutes of this movie, just waiting for it to get better. It never happened. Maybe it's one of those movies that you have to painfully watch till it finally becomes a great movie.

Maybe the younger generation enjoys it, but from the first 30 minutes, it definitely does not appear to be worth watching.

Even when English is spoken it is not very clear.

So much foreign language is bothersome.

The filming does not seem to be up to current day standards.

Oh, so very disappointing!

I wish I could have enjoyed watching this movie as much as some of the reviewers did.

It's like I'm thinking to myself ""What element of enjoyment am I missing from this movie""?",3
21 June 2022,Wanted to like this,"The women in this movie are terrific: Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Jennie Slate. But the plot and script are weak. The metaverse aspect asks viewers to suspend more belief than I was able. Absurdest comedic lines fell short. Plot development dialogue rang false. Intimate characters mother tounge is Mandarin and husband and wife talking to other in English. So much came across as unnatural... in the end it was not for me so two enthusiastic thumbs down.

14 March 2023,It's really difficult....,"...to write 600 characters on a movie you only watched for 15 seconds. Let's be clear, this is a foreign language movie so subtitles in English are included. I feel cheated. Why isn't this movie sold as a foreign movie, like Parasite was? If I want to read I'd get a book. Movies are a visual medium and although there are rare examples, like the aforementioned Parasite where the movie might be significant enough to make the odd exception I want my movie watching experience to be focused on looking at the acting, cinematography, sets etc. Not a ticker tape of text at the bottom of the screen. So that's how to write 600 characters on a 15 second movie. Crushed it!

13 March 2023,Awful...,"This is a terrible film. Not funny, not entertaining, not thought-provoking, not informative, not well thought out or put together, not anything. Just a terrible, boring, meaningless waste of time. The basic idea is good, I suppose, and probably could have been developed into something really interesting, instead of a confused and confusing mish-mash.

I really have no idea why anyone would think any aspect of this film is deserving of any of the awards it seems to be amassing, but I'd advise not be tempted to waste a couple of hours of your precious life watching this film just because of the Oscars.

19 April 2022,Worst movie ever!,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

Grade: A.",1
24 February 2023,Nothing Special,"I didn't know anything about this, other than the fact that the approval ratings were high. I had also knew it had Oscar buzz, so I thought I would check it out. I watched it on-demand. I actually had to fight not to fall asleep.

I am giving it a five because it is imaginative, but otherwise I probably would have given it a 3.

The story itself was all over the place early, but by the end it became predictable. To me, It was shot in the style of The Matrix. Lots of fight scenes with fast cuts then going to slow motion.

The story itself was quite original for about 45 minutes. They took you in all kinds of directions and it was hard to follow. Then they seemed to realize they needed to pick a story and they settled on a common, somewhat boring, family drama. They were still doing The Matrix style with more fighting, but it really didn't move the story along as quickly. The second half of the film ran out of steam.",5
9 March 2023,I don't get why this is so highly rated,"I don't get why this is so highly rated. I love indie films but honestly after 30 minutes I was losing the will to live. Very disappointing. Maybe the chaos was just not my cup of tea. I appreciate others love it, but I don't get why, so rather than sitting through all 2 hours I gave up. Maybe it would have become the visionary masterpiece others believe it to be. Or maybe it's best appreciated by people with first hand experience of psychedelic drugs. I feel that the actor's talents are wasted, but if they enjoyed making it, good for them. I realise I'm in a minority, but that's ok. If you insist on watching it some really good snacks will help!

17 March 2023,Utterly overrated!!,"This movie is a full on catastrophe version of Get Out (2017) how come an amazing version cannot get 'best picture' and this utterly annoying and confusing bad trip movie does get so many Oscars including 'best picture' is insane!

I waited till the end to make a sense of it! No chance! The movie is an absolute disaster with a bit of Tarantino, a little Ratatouille, a touch of Matrix so far so forth.. CONFUSING!

It is.a complete waste of time not getting better but getting worse and worse with each scene.. i serioisly doubt the judgment of critics and especially the Oscar committee or else I have no clue or taste whatsoever: either bagel or nothing!

29 November 2022,A Twilight Zone episode on steroids,"This film is like a twilight zone episode on steroids. If it had been a twilight zone episode, it would've been great done in less than 30 minutes given commercials in a half hour show me made back in the 60s. Unfortunately, this movie runs for two hours and 19 minutes give or take considering the end credits. There really wasn't very much original in the plot, considering the twilight zone plots. We're filmed over a half a century ago. There were some good roles for the leads, but like the plot, they lose some of their punch when stretched over such a needlessly long film. It took me four days to complete watching the film because I kept falling asleep and had to stop and watch some thing else and then come back to try and digest another chunk. By the time I watched half of it I had invested enough time in it, that I felt the need to finish it and see if the film had any redeeming qualities. In the end, it's another empty-nester film. How do parents bring up their children to be independent from them and then actually grant them that independence, complete with a heartwarming, happy ending where everyone finds true understanding of themselves and others. Grant you there is the Chinese cultural overlay, but this story plays out in every culture in millions of families every year for hundreds of years and has been made into films and TV shows many times. Again, it could've just an is as easily been made in a 30 minute episode of the twilight zone.",2
17 April 2022,"Good message, but...","...way too long. Some great moments about crucial wisdom that hopefully every human comes to realize in their lifetime. If this movie helps people gain that understanding then that's great. I definitely appreciated those moments. So much so that I may have gotten a little teary eyed... Yet, the humor aspect of it didn't really click with me. So through most of it I debated walking out of the theater. But I'm glad I was there for the payoff in last 25 minutes or so of the movie.

15 March 2023,The Emperor Has No Clothes: The Most Overhyped Movie of All Time,"I recently had the misfortune of watching Everything Everywhere All at Once and must say that it was a massive disappointment. The movie tries too hard to be eccentric and quirky without actually having anything substantial to offer. The plot is convoluted and lacks coherence, making it difficult to follow or invest in the storyline.

In terms of direction and pacing, the film was all over the place, making it tough to understand the purpose of specific scenes or why they were included in the first place.

The acting was the only bright spot. However, that's about the only bright spot.

Overall, Everything Everywhere All at Once is a lackluster attempt at being avant-garde that falls flat in every aspect. Save your time and avoid this film at all costs.

10 April 2023,Utter chaos,"As soon as I had heard the amount of Oscars this movie had won and the recommendations from a friend of mine, I set pretty high expectations for this movie. Even though the premise about the effects of life choices on the course of our lives is very intriguing and promising, I was deeply disappointed with a piece of cinema that resembles the blasting sensory stimulation of TikTok and all its alternatives.

At times the movie felt like a B-tier parody of The Matrix or a bad comedy with disengaging action scenes and poorly executed butt plug jokes. Acting was not convincing, and the plot itself does not engage the viewer, since the high speed of alternating scenes at most causes disturbance and discomfort. The only things that seem to keep viewer somewhat interested are special effects and scenery. However, these visually well made parts are buried by many ridiculous plot choices by the writers.

As this big black hole of the film script has devoured the last bits of interest from the audience, the movie tries too hard to convey its two main messages: Kindness and love cures everything & If you do not care about anything (judgement, opinions, your past), you can do and become anything you dream of. The messages undoubtedly carry lot of importance in modern world, even though they may sound a bit cheesy for some. However, the means of conveying these messages just do not hit the spot.

This film is either a hit or a miss for the viewer. The film gives a flawless depiction of what type of content attracts the majority of today's society, a fast paced and poorly structured line of meaningless events, where meaning is drawn from chaos. In my opinion, this type of chaotic storytelling is synthetic and it fails to make you identify with characters, their struggles and growth. Simultaneously it backfires at conveying the intended message. However someone who is used to watching content that requires only few second attention span might have completely opposite opinion about the movie. Personally, I hope this is not the direction of storytelling in film making.",2
15 March 2023,Got to balance out this crazyiness,"Apparently having some themes and spoonfeeding philosophy is now Oscar worthy? So many people keep saying it's because it's deep and subtle and layered. It's not. The metaphors and philosophy was nice. That's it. The film was shot amazingly and really funny. But in what world did the 2 supporting actors deserve oscars? There performances were fine. Not Oscar worthy

It is funny, heartwarming, unique and well done, but massively overratewould I recommend it 100%. It's good fund, really sweet and does give you something to think about.

Should you expect one of the most awarded films of all time to deliver? No.

26 March 2023,Boring and overrated,"Just plain overrated. Absolutely nothing is interesting. I try to enjoy it but cannot find a single moment worthwhile. All the Oscars nomination are simply a scam.none of the Oscar winner and nomination deserve it. What is the movie about ? . Far better movies other than this. Also the performance are ok. Simply boring and waste of time. There is no excitement no thrill no story no logic no message . The direction is one dimensional the acting is ordinary. Watch twice to see if missed anything but end if day simply avoidiable. Do not waste your time and watch any Marvel movies. Sometime it's just a hype.

12 September 2022,"Throw everything at every wall, all at once, to see what sticks...","I had heard so many rave reviews about this, that I had to give it a go, but I'm afraid I wasn't impressed.

Michelle Yeoh is good, as always, and it was great to see Ke Huy Quan again, who makes the best out of a somewhat thankless role. Beyond that, the movie is a drawn out, somewhat ponderous effort.

Have you ever asked yourself, are there only so many stories that can be written and only so many songs that can be sung? Have all the ideas been used up? If so, what is left, and what would you need to do, to grab someone's attention?

That's what this movie feels like. When all the ideas are gone, lets throw absolutely everything at the wall in a blinding kaleidoscopic mish-mash of so many half-baked ideas and details, that nobody will notice that there is no real story going on and nothing really happens.

I'll grant it a '5', because on first watch it's odd enough to maintain your curiosity, rather than simply switching off. Although it feels at least an hour too long. Perhaps more... It's the kind of thing that would have been better suited to a 25 minute Twilight Zone episode.",5
27 June 2023,Best Picture?,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The most pointless script ever. How such an awful movie could win many academy awards is just testament to how lame the members are. Special effects are quite good, but to what point? There is none. When it's all over you can only wonder if you could have devised a bigger waste of time than watching this movie. I remember seeing the actors and other contributors to the movie seemingly surprised beyond belief about all of the awards they were winning at the Oscars. I understand why now. If like to watch splashy special effects for more than too hours and wonder where it's all going, then this is the movie for you.

It's like a chinese ideea of a Matrix, but it is too tryhard and I can't believe it won so many oscars because the storyline is just nonsense, I did not experience anything than just trying to understand what is going on in this movie and the amalgam of scenes that wanted to make u understand something about existence or whatever, but really it is nonsense absurd and u should just watch Matrix if you want to get out of this universe and be mind blown by a movie... it is a waste of TIME in all UNIVERSES.

TRYHARD that is what this movie is .. please... i want an oscar and I will put so many scenes and try to give you the reason of why we exist...the rock scene if i should even get into that was the only second I could catch my breath and realise how stupid this was really... please I know there must be others who think the same ... this is absurd.

23 January 2023,Just not for me,"I'm not even sure what to give this movie for star rating, it looks beautiful, the main actress is wonderful and it's pretty much technically stellar, but I think what's missing is the heart of all filmmaking- storytelling- After a while the constant fighting and craziness just wears on you, the first two 'parts' of the movie are just constant fighting and conflict, I must admit at some point I just gave up and zoned out, it started off ok and to be honest I think I would have rather watched a movie with the lead actress struggling to save her laundromat and Jamie lee Curtis the tax person, that actually would have been more interesting.

Edit: 11 nomitations for Oscars, are you freakin kidding me.

The goody bags provided to Oscar voters must be worth a lot. The plot is simplistic to say the least and looks to end the search for intelligent life in the multiverse. How Jamie Lee Curtiss got involved in this travesty is beyond me. Looks as though the standard of acting required to be an Oscar contender like a lot of todays life has been dumbed down. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay to watch this at a cinema. But it will not be the first time the luvvies and critics have fallen for a terrible movie that has been to say the least poor.

Plenty of other great movies do a better job portraying the message of this movie. Save your time, you're not missing out on much. There is nothing masterful about this movie, the story/message is recycled from other ideas, and cinematography, acting, and directing is ok (could even argue being subpar) but not Oscar worthy. If you want watch a movie that actually gives you the feeling of laughter and sadness with great direction and shooting from this years films, watch Banshees of Inisherin.

17 March 2023,a loss of 2+ hours of this lifetime in my universe,"I am not a movie snob. I watch, and mostly enjoy, many many movies per week. A great story told well is a great movie.

However... after 15 minutes of this story i was befuddled; after 60 minutes i was confused; after the movie ended i was looking for the time i lost on this one.

EEAAO reminded me of the kind of psychedelic slop put together to warn kids from using hallucinogens back in the 60's. I was waiting for a flash back from my hallucinogen days while watching this 'story'....

on the plus side, really interesting use of lighting and editing.

Take a half of a xanax before this movie-- Look out if you like closed captioning, as you may miss tons of dialog and possibly go blind.....",2
16 October 2022,Unique but convoluted,"I am a big Michelle Yeoh fan.....I knew and liked her before Crouching Tiger made her internationally known. I really like Jamie Lee Curtis. And the actor that played the husband is an excellent actor and was the most believable in switching emotions. Even the guy in the wheelchair is famously known and played the main villian in 'Big Trouble in Little China'. So the movie got it right with the casting but there is another huge problem....story and pacing. While the story seems original, it is a mishmash of 'The One'(multiple universes) & Sense 8(grabbing abilities from other selves) & Matrix(alternate reality).

The problem is the movie is trying to be all three while trying to be a comedy and family drama with the already science fiction/fantasy/kung fu elements that exists. Does that statement sounds confusing? Then you understand how this movie will be. It is extremely chaotic, jarring and the combination of drama, comedy, scifi, fantasy brings down the movie. There is so much going on and so much explanation needed to understand that the director should have slowed it down a few times in the beginning so that the audience can understand the rules. Instead each scene is explaining something new as if they are making it up as they go. After a while, you are tired and don't care anymore as the director tries to amp up the action and special effects of a scene without explaining why the scene is even happening.

To put this in perspective, imagine Color Purple, Fast and the Furious, Jackie Chan movie smashed together and directed by Michael Bay and that is what you have here.",3
31 May 2022,Too weird and chaotic,"I understand the movie was very creative and was trying to communicate lots of deep statements. However, i just didn't like it. My GF also hated every minute of this.

If you are an artist you would probably enjoy this. But if you are not into scifi and lots of craziness then this would not be for you.

It was a bit on the funny side though. But I couldn't sit through the craziness.

13 March 2023,"4 stars, just for the effort and jobs created","As the title review mentions, I offered 4 stars just for the effort and the jobs created while making this movie.

Apparently, script, story and everything else does not matter when you have to follow a political agenda. We need to give Oscars to Asians, because they never got one. Next time on Oscars - we need to give Oscars to Africans because they never got one. And so on, until everybody feels included, even though their movies are crap, without essence or authenticity.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is the start of a new era, where talent doesn't mean anything, as long as it's socially correct.

Jamie Lee Curtis got the Oscar for this movie just because she was fading away, so there was no other chance to award her for years of activity.",4
15 March 2023,Modern Day Eraserhead on Steroids and Hallucinogens,"Surreal, hyper and ADHD satisfying paced cinema that should come with a prerequisite course to prepare the viewer of its intentions and meaning. Like the vintage Eraserhead, it can leave the viewer agitated and confused instead of entertained. For some, they ""get it"" and that's ok. For others like me, it's too much work to invest in getting satisfaction. The Oscar accolades and numerous awards are an overreach but I do agree that there is talent demonstrated in the concept and cinematography. Whether Hollywood is attempting to show its acceptance of the Asian community with all of these awards remains a question, in my opinion. Frankly, I'm impressed but not to the point of believing it deserved so many awards.

25 January 2023,"Overlong, Overstuffed and Ultimately Ridicilous","I watched ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" recently. It is a very strange movie about multiple realities intersecting and affecting the entire universe. It is up to a middle-aged Chinese immigrant (Michelle Yeoh) to save the universe! Also involved is Jamie Lee Curtis as an overzealous IRS auditor! To me, it seemed like being in an overlong acid trip (although I have never taken LSD, it seemed like something one might experience on that drug!). So, I am not sure I can recommend this movie, except that Michelle Yeoh and especially Jamie Lee Curtis's performances are very good. I found the movie itself to be overstuffed, overlong and ultimately ridiculous. 5/10.

27 January 2023,I would give it 0 stars if possible,"I couldn't even watch the whole movie, if I was watching in the theatres I wouldve walked out early no question. This is complete garbage just a bunch of random scenes that aren't correlated .. there's no build up of the story, the fighting scenes are stupid and mostly not funny. You know a movie is bad when it literally takes you days to get through half of it .. I cant watch this nonsense for more than 20 mins straight. God it's so awful it's almost mind blowing. I was expecting so much more after seeing the reviews .. what happened to the inceptions of the world? They dont make movies like that anymore I guess.

28 January 2023,Kung Fu Movie Masquerading as Philosophy,"We all know the politics served up every year by the Academy. This film fits the mold. Fundamentally its an overrated and derivative superhero movie full of action movie tropes. I mean whats more cliche than asians owning a laundromat? Yes the female lead is well acted, but big deal. You want some inter dimensional movie content, try Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai or even for the most juvenile, go all the way back to Back to The Future. These movies have no pretence of philosophical underpinnings for Millenials who more and more get their bread from TikTok and think they know something about a ""multiverse"" from Youtube University. Pass.

13 February 2023,"Came for the nihilism, left disappointed","Went in with high expectations, especially as someone who enjoys mindscrew media and nihilism, but this was a mess of a movie. The first 45 minutes telling the story of a struggling immigrant family had me engaged, despite the rather hamfisted misunderstood lesbian daughter drama, but as soon as they go to the IRS office, the entire movie goes off the rails and turns into a wacky kung-fu romp. I struggled to suspend my disbelief because the writing was so stereotypical that I just assumed they were going to pull back the veil to reveal they were parodying bad science fiction, but no, they spend two hours on this weak plot. Most frustratingly, Ke Huy Quan (Waymond) mumbles and rushes through most of his lines and switches frequently between Mandarin and English, making his frenzied explanations incoherent and hard to follow. This was an annoying and disappointing watch and I found myself constantly checking to see when it would be over.

19 March 2023,One word: illogical,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

23 September 2022,Too much hyped,"I had a lot of expectations for this movie after hearing so much positive about the movie from both critics and the audience. The makers tried to be deep and profound, but what resulted was two hours of head-splitting chaos and confusion. I just don't understand the hype for this movie. They tried too hard to be weird. I think at the end they were trying to pull the heartstrings, but I was too confused to know for sure. I'm not even sure what the movie was about. Whatever it was, they should have had an epileptic seizure warning. Overall, it was just a messy movie with bad editing and it was just movie's luck that it worked at box office.

7 May 2022,Tries to be Kung Fu Hustle,"Clearly a lot of people liked this, but to me it came across as just an attempt to distract the audience with a barrage of senseless images. Kung Fu Hustle pulled this off in 2004, but I don't think it's possible to get away with that a second time. Also, Kung Fu Hustle culminated in a pretty decent martial arts sequence. I won't see this one again, if I can avoid it. It was cool, though, to see Short Round back on the screen!

27 March 2023,Couldn't connect,"I tried watching this movie two times. First time couldn't pass 20 min. While watching I fell asleep. Then when I heard it won Oscar and Everyone kept talking about it. Thought about giving it a try one more time.

It was just too much for me. I couldn't connect and I kept getting confused and felt asleep again. I read others reviews to get the insight. Like the title of the movie it was everything, everywhere all at once.

I really wanted to like it but it just not for me. There are so many people who really like it. I'm not one of them.

I love the Asians representation and I'm really happy for the cast though.

20 May 2023,What a mess!,"I've struggled through many movies before, but this one takes the cake. I get what it was trying to do, it just didn't do it as well as Rick & Morty have done with multiverse and interdimensional travel. I didn't feel for any of the characters at all. The father was memorable from Seinfeld...""Sign-fell.....FOUR!"". Yeah, it's that guy. I just cannot believe how long this movie was for such a thin plot. I can see a lot of effort was put into effects and visuals, but they should worked on presentation of the story itself. The jumping around to ridiculous segwes was more aggravating than intriguing. It was really unwatchable for me and it took me four tries to get through it. I'm pretty tolerant and forgiving with movies of all kinds, but with all of the hype this received, it was more overreach and overcompensation of a terrible movie. And no, it wasn't deep or too intellectual for me. It was being made it up as they went along. I was hoping to be challenged and to grow from it. It failed me.

25 March 2023,Celebrates naturalistic violence,"I was really hyped to see this movie, especially to see the multiverse visualization and it was the first film I wanted to watch in a cinema for years.

I also wanted to watch it on my birthday in an open air cinema but that didn't happen due to torrents of rain and I am glad. Why?

This movie celebrates naturalistic violence. It starts innocently enough depicting a realistic family facing all kinds of struggles, mostly about money and relationships.

Then it suddenly descends into graphic cruelty towards average people (think a tax officer, low level unarmed government building security or innocent bystanders).

If you enjoy average people viciously hit in the face, necks snapped and inflicting pain this one is for you.

I watched this with my date who was a victim of brutality (indeed her face was broken once) so I suggested to leave the cinema after 20 minutes or so as the graphic violence just got worse and worse.

We went home and had some intimate sex instead. That was the best part of the movie.

The multiverse idea is just used as an excuse to justify depictions of sadism and gore. The fact that this celebration of naturalistic violence received so many Oscars proves the poor state of our world and how numb audiences are who actually laugh about physical harm inflicted to their fellow human beings.

And don't think that I did not watch some Eastern type of movies in the past where supernatural fighters would fly and do kung fu in fantasy historical settings. This movie here is different in that people like me and you get hurt.",2
14 May 2022,Eyes hurting from all the rolling...,"This movie tries way too hard. Maybe it's an attempt to match the the extreme pace of so many movies these days - trying to dazzle audiences with constant action, humour, emotions and story so we don't lose attention...or something. I suppose many of us have lost the patience to appreciate the character development, subtlety, and simplicity of well-crafted plots. Maybe we have been conditioned by Marvel, tik tok and YouTube to crave bursts of action, CGI, flashing lights and simple, accessible, and lazy comedy. This movie fails to capture my attention because it's all there, all at once. I don't have to wait for anything, and I don't have time to wonder what will happen next. Mind you, it's too random for this anyway. I'm disheartened to see this movie rated so highly. Nothing but cheap thrills here.

5 April 2023,The worst movie makes no sense,"People who made this movie were on the worst drugs on the planet. Pointless endless totally bizarre, like taking heroin acid methamphetamine and jumping out out a plane at 35000 feet while having sex with a donkey in front of everyone you ever met in your life. I would rather try to learn every language in the world standing on my head in the desert while being humped non stop by every animal that God ever made and never dying. It's almost a contest to see how far you can make it watching this movie before you finally realize what a total waste of time you just experienced. If you like subtitles throughout an entire movie, than this one is for you.

9 January 2023,Everything (a) Bagel?? Very overrated movie,"Lots of thoughts and colourful spots. Like an abstract expressionist painting. But this movie doesn't fulfill a simple definition of art: ""A work of fiction that creates its own reality."" No. This movie has no reality. Only bits and pieces of craftsmanship that add up to 2 hours of nothing. Heard (and seen) in dialogue like ""I want to be Your daughter in a place that is not this but somewhere where that place is me"". (Or something similar. I paraphrased). If the amount of energy to write childish and primitive, repetitive jokes about bodily functions or adult toys would have been invested in plot, characters, and more than two and a half funny dialogue lines - well, the movie could have been okay. And hopefully 65 minutes shorter.

10 March 2023,Who doesn't find sausage hands hilarious?,"This movie reminded me of two other movies that I've seen in my life which were so terrible that I had a hard time watching them. These were 'This is the end' and 'Dumb and Dumber To'. In both cases, I watched the movies because a friend chose them. However, this time, I had only myself to blame for sitting through 140 minutes of the film and wondering ""What am I watching? Where do the 8 stars on IMDB come from? When will it get better? Is this supposed to be make me laugh?""

Usually, I check IMDB before watching a movie as it gives me an idea of the quality of the movie. This particular one had received an 8 out of 10, yet I had never been more disappointed with a movie. The plot was incoherent and bizarre, while the attempt at humor consisted of oddities that seemed like they were meant to be funny just because of their randomness. If the idea of an alternate universe where people have hotdogs for hands makes you chuckle, you might want to check out this movie. But only do so if you also enjoy childish humor, tasteless unnecessary sex jokes, and a cheap 'message' that is slapped in your face. Otherwise don't bother.

If you're curious, read a few other mixed or low rating reviews first (I wish I had done that) and you'll find out soon enough if this movie is for you or not. But I would suggest skipping it altogether. I don't regret watching it, but I do regret finishing it because it never got any better and it was a waste of time.",1
30 May 2022,What the f is this rubbish?,"Honestly this is the worst movie I have ever watched for a long time, couldn't bare any longer than 45 mins. I can understand why Jackie Chan was originally supposed to be the main character but he didn't act in this movie.

It's a disgrace to the movie industry and to Asian community as well...

15 April 2023,"Virtuoso performances, but a bit of a drag overall","There's nothing not to love about the utterly stellar performance of Michelle Yeoh; never was an Oscar more richly deserved. And she's supported by a terrific cast, with Ke Quy Kwan as the husband, and Jamie Lee Curtis - an inspired casting choice - playing a dowdy (but powerful!) IRS agent.

That being said, the film was too long for its content, and I thought it lacked coherence. Rather than one film, it felt as though I was watching about 5 very similar films all spliced together, and by about half way through I'd begun to lose interest. (My partner outdid me in lack of interest and fell asleep.) And by the end I was checking my watch with impatience.

In a way it was like watching a virtuoso violinist or pianist playing brilliant music - you start off being entertained and amazed at the sheer technical mastery and wizardry of the musician, but after a while you get bored by the pyrotechnics and wish for something with a bit of heart. This film was a bit like that - intensely full-on, a madcap wild ride, but ultimately lacking heart.

My partner was also uncomfortable about the scenes with the dog being used a sort of catapult or sling shot.

There was humour of quite a broad sort (who will ever look at a butt-plug the same way again?) which I felt was a bit out of character for the film. I should say that I'm no prude, I just thought that these scenes were gratuitous.

In short, too long for its content, and lacking depth of feeling.",5
16 January 2023,Torturous,"2+ hours of vapid filmmakers screaming at me, demanding that I acknowledge their brilliance. Through 139 minutes of screamed cliches and bumper-sticker psychology, they continue to pound home some meaningless insight(?) like a self-impressed 14 year-old. Loud and piercing, this movie is entirely populated by shallow, miserable characters, none of whom are likable nor draw us into their stories. The movie noticeably changes gears right about the time the viewer wishes it to simply end: realizing that whatever its intention was is not working, it quickly devolves from dumb to ridiculous to patently stupid. A total regret.

13 March 2023,"TERRIBLE MOVIE, SO HYPED AND OVERRATED WORST MOVIE EVER!","This movie does not have plot you can follow, just random scenes. I could not finish the movie and I never not finish a movie because no matter how bad it is, but this became so stupid and unbearable it border on torture then entertainment.

The actors are the only thing that gives this movie any hype, since there are big stars. This goes to show you that Hollywood has gone down hill and would stick big names in any movie regardless if this good or entertaining just to make a money.

Do not go see this I promise you are not missing out on anything. You cannot recover the time loss watching such terrible trash.

7 February 2023,Trying to hype the multiverse theory?,"I am seriously struggling to understand the amount of praise being heaped on this movie. Granted, the lead (M Yeoh) and a few others provide commendable performances, but this barely compensates for the jarring scene transitions and often weak/trite dialog.

While the pastiche of colour and special effects was meant to help convey humour and levity, it's overuse became tedious and harder to watch as this lengthy movie progressed.

Efforts to ""Mormanise"" the audience with their repeated religious 'be kind' messaging, felt contrived, inauthentic and predictable.

In summary, attempting a smorgasbord of sci-fi humour and relying upon an Asian laundromat setting & often-clunky special effects failed to deliver on expectations. However, I've happily scored a solid 3, acknowledgment of the first time I've seen this (multiverse) premise being explored in a comedy.",3

There is some decent actions and funny scene but boy I was confused. Someone else mentioned that it reminded them of the matrix and I agree. I think the directors aimed for this movie to have a deep message but im kind of unsure what that is. My interpretation is basically the obstacles the mother has to go through on her own why also learning to let go of her daughter, let her be her own person and live her life. The mother seem to have a hard time doing this because of how easily her own father was willing to send her away. In the end the movie was long and drawn out I do not recommend.

4 March 2023,I guess I was in the wrong universe to enjoy this film.,"I was looking forward to the movie but upon initial viewing I only got about 1/2 way through and quit watching. I continued to see the great reviews and Oscar nominations, what was I missing?

I decided to give ""Everywhere, Everything, All at Once"" another try. I watched it all the way through but it never captured my attention. The presentation of the multiverse didn't work for me. I guess I'm just limited by my linear thinking.

The actors were engaging but the story was not. I know the movie was trying to convey some grand message on living one's life but it was lost on me.

On a technical side it should win the Oscar for Editing!

26 January 2023,What?,"I watch movies to be entertained. I watch documentaries to learn. I watch comedies to be amused. I watch horror to be frightened. I watch sci-fi's to make me dream of the future. You get the idea.

What I don't want to watch is movies, like this one, that I get nothing from. It's someone's idea of a comedy, not mine. It's a bunch of dumb situations, with people doing dumb things to get dumb results.

For me, it was a gigantic waste of time. I only watched to the end to see if it had ANY redeeming qualities that would make people want to give it an Academy Award for Best Picture. I didn't see any.

But, I guess in this world where people vote in politicians like Donald Trump and company, where crazy theories get people to March on our Congress, etc. The universe really is going crazy and in that crazy universe this just might be considered an excellent movie.

24 August 2023,The Most Baffling Movie,"When I first heard about this movie all I heard was praise. Everyone around me was going on about how good this movie is, among reviews online saying it was the best movie of the year. From my curiosity, I played this movie. At first I was extremely confused. I came into the movie blind not knowing much about it at all. I only had it hyped in my head (my first mistake). I continued to watch this movie and as this movie went on. I thought at some moment there would be a movie changing moment and cinema moment. There was nothing. The entire movie was absurdism and just plain unfunny. Humor of what? Fighting with dicks? Hot dogs for fingers? Did I watch the same movie as everyone else. The same movie that won over a multitude of awards. The most baffling thing was that this movie won 7 Oscars. I did not think the performances in this movie was out of this world or anything crazy to deserve that many awards. At first I thought it was just me. All the people around me were crying over this movie. So I rewatched the movie again. It became painfully harder to watch this time. The movies runtime is so long and it is just plain boring to me. I ended up giving this movie one more chance with a third watch. The third watch made me realize that the movie simply was not for me. I understood the movie. I understood that the movie was about a mother becoming accepting about her daughter. For reference I'm a bi girl with immigrant and homophobic parents. So it is not that the movie did not relate to me. I just for the life of me can not understand how people are rating this the best or their favorite movie. It for certain did not deserve all the awards it received either.",1

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

24 April 2023,What a load of ****,"Rarely am I motivated to write a review of any film, however bad - but this is simply one of the worst films I have attempted to watch for a long time..

I don't know what the Oscar reviewers were smoking when they watched this, but if it in any way normalized this film and made it appear in any way good, I would avoid it.

I only gave 1 star because one cannot give zero..

I truly feel sorry for those films that were not given any Oscars and who I feel really really deserved them, after seeing this chaotic, confusing childish rubbish which lacks any of the values I would assume are usually used to judge a great film..

A perfect case of the emperors new clothes and which I would recommend you avoid.

17 March 2023,No wonder it's free with Prime,"Stuck with it for 50 minutes expecting it to improve; it did marginally to earn 3 stars!

Hubbie would give it 1 as it gave him a headache with the constant diatribe of burbling drivel. The main character, Everlyn has a husband who should have been cast as her son (by appearance of age). I imagine the chaotic storyline and acting requirements must be a credit to the actors. As you can guess, not my kind of movie and as with all movies, it's personal taste. Sadly I was drawn to it for its Oscars but I would class this film as definitely a ""Marmite"" offering. Typically one could separate the storyline from the quality of the actors; well they deserve a ""bravo"" for sticking it out and I'll try not to let it prejudice what I choose to watch in the future.

24 April 2022,A dog's breakfast,"There were a few pieces of nice meat in there...but, most of it was messy filler. The movie is reminiscent of The Family Guy episode where Stewie uses his machine and travels to different universes. I think they even hit some of the same places. The nice thing about Stewie's adventures is that was less than 30 minutes. Perhaps it is my age, but I am done with movies that go on and on. Does anything ever end up on the editing floor anymore? Lord, I'm trying to finish this review and I keep getting the message that it is not long enough. Really?

14 March 2023,Puerile,"Let's just say the unsayable... this movie is puerile. That single worded description sums it up better than anything. It has nothing. It is childish, silly and painfully unfunny. There is an attempt to present big spiritual, universal themes, which just come off as confused, shallow teenage tropes. The ""humour"" is nerdy, lacks sophistication, wit and is devoid of actual laughs. Whatever comedy is there is cringe worthy, and you find yourself referring to your viewing partner to see if they are as silently bewildered by its lameness as you are. It's got colour, multiverse-jumping madness, martial arts, quantum physics I'm told. All of that is fun and great, but there is nothing of substance in any of it. No story, no feeling, no guts.

It also suffers that thing so many bad films do... running massively overtime by trying to be an otherworldly epic. It drags on an hour past it's natural cut off time. Just an attenuated, over-boiled mess that results in nothing significant.

I wanted to like this film, I really did. I saw it well before the Oscars hype and was beguiled by how bad it was because I was genuinely looking forward to it going in. At first it was unpopular opinion to say it's not actually good, but after being the most overrated film in living memory (especially post-Oscars) I can see a steady pushback fomenting from the unconvinced masses.",3

19 June 2022,Just sad and disappointing,"I'm still in the movies, 1h38 minutes into the movie, and have absolutely zero interest in seeing what will happen. I'm so disappointed. Many people on tweeter saying this is not only a good movie, but one of the best they've ever seen. Wtf happened to people???

My guess is Tik Tok has ruined people's brains and attention span and so this is the kind of movie they enjoy: cheap comedy, very short scenes that make no sense and shallow 'philosophical' ideas. Totally depressing. I was expecting to at least see Yeoh performing some quality martial arts scenes, but not even that. They've added so many ridiculous special effects that the fight scenes become embarrassing to watch. They're not funny at all. Disgraceful. I'm giving a 1 in order to maybe save some people from having high expectations as I did and wasting their money in the kino. Total garbage that may please social media addicted adolescents, that's it.

2 January 2023,Overhyped tosh,"Came to this expecting to be blown away, but what a let down. Just a series of idiotic fight scenes, ridiculous characters and plot less. Note to self to ignore reviewers in the future. Beauty, and appreciation of film, is in the eye of the beholder and this was plain ugly.

Make your own judgements of course but my recommendation would be to avoid this like the Plague. A bubonic nuclear powered bustard hybrid of a COVID/SARS mankind ending Plague, wrapped in anthrax. Life's too short to waste watching this, wondering why others love it and when it's going to get better/ become watchable. It doesn't.

I strongly recommend to watch movies that actually make sense and stop using the ""native"" language in movies then adding things like : Damn , Holy sh^^t and so on to , quote : make a point! - We get it it's funny. Good idea , bad landing ,Overall -1.

13 March 2023,Most Confusing Film,"The first 40 minutes of this film caught my attention, but the rest of it was a mess of jumbled confusion. With the exception of Jamie Lee Curtis for comic relief, the rest of this film was just unwatchable. There were many talented actors in EEAAO, but there was too much going on, and it most certainly made many viewers puzzled. It was like one big LSD trip to me. It kept going from one dimension to another, and the viewer could not comprehend what was going on. A person has to understand what is going on first before too much else is going on. Therefore, it was just one big mass of confusion, and the movie was much too long and boring.

20 July 2022,Nope. Didn't get it.,"This is one of those movies where it's so ambitious, so much going on that people are afraid to criticize it. I'm not afraid. This movie was a mess. Characters and scenes added with reckless abandon. A plot that went nowhere. The choreography was pretty good. The acting by the daughter was good. That's it. This was a silly movie and it only got an 8.2 because people won't admit how dumb it was. The work that went into it was pretty impressive but wow. Just a dumb movie. Not for me.

17 December 2022,The movie equivalent of Thumbelina (with kung fu),"This movie started of well with an intriguing beginning and concept, but got too carried away with it's own cleverness. It's like the writers got progressively drunk.

It reminds me of Thumbelina, a story with a passive person, which is really just a random string of plots cobbled together and everything turns out it ok because of (insert random event here).

It had its moments of laugh out loud wacky but the endless derivative Matrix-on-acid kung fu scenes were actually boring and should have been edited out. We get it ok? They can draw on other universe skills, but did we need an hour of that?

18 March 2023,Peurile Junk,"Good news. Editing is fine. Bad news. Everything everywhere else is a mess in this pretentious chasm of Jet Li meets Wonder Woman in time travels. Script's an utter mishmash of stale and misaligned references. Just I: It's a ripoff of great films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" This makes no sense a couple of minutes in and it gets worse by the minute. I watched it three times, hoping against hope that I'd find a nugget of wisdom or teardrop of emotion. No such luck. Best delusionary screenplay in ages. Singularly the worst film ever to even be nominated for an Oscar, let alone winning one. Hollywood's gone mad.

It feels like Chinese investors bankrolled this and insisted on it being entirely in Chinese. I've seen reviewers giving it 100 out of 100. Unbelievable. I gave it 30 minutes more than it deserved and you shouldn't give it 3 minutes. Awful on every level. Truly the ""emperor wears no clothes"".

What a waste.

Am I the only one? You people are giving this 8+ out of 10? Hell no. A confused expensive mess pandering to Chinese investors. Bafflingly bad.

25 January 2023,What a Total Mess,"I just watched Everything... What an absolutely horrible movie. It made no sense at all. How in God's green earth did Yeoh and Jamie Lee get nominated for this is mind-boggling. The same goes for how this is anywhere near being a Best Picture. This is just a horrific movie. Which means it'll probably win. This is exactly the kind of frenetic, ""art"" that the Academy voters love to have win. They all think this is so cutting edge and groundbreaking. In reality, it is a jumbled mess that one really needs to be on hallucinatory psychatropes to appreciate. Every other nominated movie is better than this - even Top Gun: Maverick, and that's saying something.

22 December 2022,Disappointed really...,"I guess I don't really know what I was expecting... I came to this movie on the recommendation of a movie influencer I follow but purposefully didn't look into it much. I knew it was about exploring other universes and that is usually right up my street.

I was expecting something like ""About Time""and ""Butterfly Effect"" - quite moving storylines with real substance.

Unfortunately I found this verged on the ridiculous. Which I know you have to expect a little with a 'time-travel' style film, but there's ways to it without it becoming silly.

I'm sure some people will find some scenes moving or emotional but I unfortunately I didn't care about the characters enough. It did make me laugh in parts big overall, it was a miss from me.

27 January 2023,Hyped spoof ripoff of Matrix + Inception,"Insanely hyped ripoff collage of The Matrix + Inception but in a Steve Martin spoof comedy style.

The equation is: Chinese Kungfu B-Movie from the '70s + The Matrix + Inception - great concepts - the meaningful parts - the great CGI.

The film itself is a comedy, so suspension of belief and all, but it's rather dumb, even demented here and there, with a few funny peaks in Monthy Python style. Its attempts at being spiritual, deep and dramatic are but cheesy, silly and all in all the gullible same ol' family issues that seemingly afflict most people out there. Or so Hollywood seems to think anyway.

If you love forced tears, hypocritical hugs and last minute redemptions, you are in for a treat. Like, I can live 99% of my life as a complete jerk to everyone I know, but I did that because I was worried about bills. I can always turn into somebody completely different in 3 seconds, share a few tears, hug the people I mistreated for decades and all will fall magically into place. With a hug. A very cheesy one.

The film itself is a so so comedy, but I am so annoyed by the insane hype that this is going to be a well placed 1.

Yes, I will cheat this time. It's 1/10 and I ain't sorry folks. Next time be more honest in your ratings. If you give this dough a 10/10, what would you give to its originals (The Matrix, Inception)? 250/10?

And what about, say, any Kurosawa masterpieces? 3500/10?

29 March 2023,Matrix meets post truth world,"It was hard to tell what this movie was trying to get at. It was like a reflection of the philosophy of the age: everything. I mean really everything, is possible, and it iis up to you to choose it. And yet it didn't really believe that either, because it was fatalistic also, like toppings on a bagel. You have no control of it. There ate good themes, but they are jumbled up. Yet on the surface apparent selfless love wins through in the end for mo apparent reason.

The acting was brilliant, but the mediocrity of the script means it will be one of those movies that we will be wondering in years to come how on earth it won so many oscars.

21 May 2023,Oh so bloated,"Remarkable performances by Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis. Fight scenes were well choreographed. It's filled with countless metaphors (some of which are clever) in its attempt to deliver a worthwhile message.

But- It goes on and on and on implying that the audience is just too dim to grasp its deep meaning unless it explains it with another ""universe"", another parallel world. It is the equivalent of a hot pink prom dress with way too may ruffles, sequins, bugle bead fringe and peacock appliqu√©s. And it just goes on and on and on and on when it could have easily ended 20 universes in.

11 February 2023,Quite a whirlwind,"I appreciate the technical craft required to make this movie, and just how inventive the story is. I was with it for about half, but then it just got too weird for me. The main story about Evelyn and her family was not too hard to follow and executed pretty well. It was the story going on in the different multiverses that I started to get lost in. The multiverse with the hot dog fingers was a bit too much for me. I did laugh quite a bit during the first half, but a lot less in the second half. I see why people like it; it's just not my type of movie. I'll be interested to see how well it does at the Academy Awards.

19 March 2023,"The Matrix , Inception , Men in Black 3 All at Once","For me this is pure Joke. Literally for 2 h and 20 minutes , there are two scenes that mean something: the first one in the laundry and the last one (the hug). Everything in between is complete nonsense. Even LaLa Land deserved more the Oscar than this. Argo wasthe most boring and confusing Oscar winner for me but this tops it.

I barely can say anything positive: maybe the act of Jamie Lee Curtis and Ke huy Quan are goods of the movie.

I think that the creators try to make a visual resuscitation for someone already in brain death !!!

Just watch the movies I mention above and don't waste 2 hours of your time.

14 March 2023,I didn't like it BUT...,"After five attempts to watch this movie I gave up and came here to write a negative review. Then I read the review which said it gets better in the second half, so I went back for a sixth time. After about 10 minutes I FF'd to try to find that part, but I give up. I'm not a fan of CGI in general and this had so much I just couldn't stand it. But let me tell you about the parts I did like: Ke Huy Quan's moving Oscar speech, and the interview of 94 year old James Hong on the red carpet. They both brought me to tears. I am 75, so I have seen Hong my whole life, mostly in bit parts. He talked about the Chinese Exclusion Act (a part of US history some people don't want you to know about), and how he felt when he could not get parts in films about Asians because they were given to white actors with taped up eyes. It was good to see Asian actors finally get the parts and appreciation they deserved, but for me that is the best part about this film.

4 September 2022,Total Chaos and Outrageousness,"I don't see what people see in this movie. I was in an audience that was mostly 20 year-olds. What I found gross and offensive, a lot of the audience found to be funny. To use violence and sick humor to make points about how to treat others correctly and compassionately just doesn't do it for me. It's trying to please viewers' in a sensorial way which is totally contrary to the feeling, gracious way of creating a lasting worthwhile message in a film. There's just too much emphasis on sick, sensorial thrills in this. Let's make better movies, filmmakers that really touch and audience in a genuine way!

17 February 2023,Conservative,"The film's incredible importance lies in its unintentional depiction of what it means to be lost and confused (both artistically and practically) in a world of destabilized values.

Along the ""whacky"" journey, certain themes emerge: histrionic pity/compassion, tawdry humor, fragile weakness, the exhaustion of spirit, and the frightening, crippling fear of characters partaking and marginally succeeding in barely achieving the average/mediocre life. In essence, it therefore represents a narrative that dangerously projects a common ideal as if it is superior and noble.

In all the commotion, tiresome tricks, and ""shocking"" artistic choices (rocks, shameless sexual humor, etc.) the narrative does not fail to argue for its own set of specific values (weak kindness, categorical acceptance/tolerance, passivity, etc.). These values do not reflect courage, to me, but rather the voice of an exhausted nihilism.

As a whole this film desperately searches and lunges for something meaningful among the ""wild"" (not that wild) ""multiverse"" (not that multi). However, it forgoes any chance for meaning because it does not take the time and energy to create meaning itself.

Instead it shuns the responsibility of meaning to the viewer: please make something of this madness for me! In my opinion that is its appeal. But, the meaning made, the final conclusion of the audience is ultimately one and the same: there is no great standard for judgement anymore.

Perhaps worst of all, this film fails to realize that the inclusion of all things is precisely what it partially argues for. But, the inclusion of everything is itself the creation of meaninglessness since distinctions and judgements are necessary for making meaning. Ironically, that very meaningless it unintentionally creates is also what forces it to settle for the average as its goal.

Finally, its main contradiction is the second thing the film argues for: its own exclusive ideas which I touched on above (kindness, etc.). Therefore it rejects any complete concept of ""everything."" For example, it has a tendency to include the loud, unpredictable, overly-sensory, etc., but excludes the subtle, graceful, patient, delicate, confident, proud, healthy, tasteful, or beautiful.

In the end, despite its rowdy favoritism towards 1) over-stimulation 2) timid adventure, 3) cheap novelty, 4) the debasement/confusion of the human, and 5) alcoholic escapism, it only drifts back to common conservative values. In that it resembles an accidental advertisement for conservatism.",1
28 January 2023,"It's imaginative, new and bloody tedious","This film has moments of real quality throughout, it is beyond wacky and is the modern day Dr Strangelove in its out there brilliance. 5 sittings it took to watch the whole movie as it was like a constant buzz saw, unrelenting and demanding, an unruly child that wouldn't give up. I kind of liked it but will never watch it again as it is so in your face for such an awful long time that I had to keep stopping the movie and come back another day to continue.

The actors are good and I love the minimalist cast and the multi-roles, I can see this style working on the stage with minimalist sets and cast and it is very cleverly worked. Action scenes are great although the hot dogs are gross.

It just feels like too much and I love long narrative and FX laden movies but this was too much for me.

21 February 2023,Too complicated for me,"I'm sorry I actually paid to see this piece of art. I expected a science fiction movie with a touch of comedy. What I got instead was a nonsense script that got worse as the story progressed. The acting was great, however the story was confusing and made me wonder why this picture got so many good reviews. Maybe people saw something I didn't see. The fact is, if you want to be entertained without having to do some brain work, go somewhere else. This movie require a lot of attention and thought. I was looking for something light so I got disappointed. I hope this review helps people like me who are looking for some simple and funny form of entertainment.

17 March 2023,Rick and Morty ripoff,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

13 March 2023,"Messy, exhausting, just tiresome","To be fair: it wasn't that bad. It was certainly unique, but uniqueness doesn't mean greatness. There were a lot of interesting layers of this film, but the chaos and ADHD-like performing was just too dominating. It had slightly similar energy to 'dirk gently's hollistic detective agency'. The exception being that the latter didn't cause a seizure. There is nothing wrong with a bit of mind-bending and chaotic story telling, but when a movie is almost 2.5 hours of a headache causing LSD-trip, i'd rather just take the LSD. And yes, to be fair, it wasn't that bad. I'd give it a 4-5. But seeing the rating it currently holds, I just felt I had to bring the average down, cause it wasn't that good either.

It is a waste of time so watch this movie.... to try to watch it till the end, but I absolutely had to give up halfway because I was feeling I could lead a completely different life if I just stopped watching this senseless waste of my time.

Only a tech head who likes cool special effects will be fascinated by the overly long and tedious Kung Fu movie. Somewhere in there, a message is buried. I will be horrified if this film receives the Oscar for best picture.

I'm sure you can do better things that watching this horrible film , if o can call it ""film ""

And this film simply - no. I gave myself time, listened to other people's opinions to really see if I was missing something when it comes to this movie, then watched it again and I just liked it even less. It's as if it was written by today's typical Hollywood screenwriters who from the bottom of their hearts want to be original and different, but they don't have the potential for that, so nothing drinks water. I don't understand where those films that used to be Oscar winners have gone! Just some nonsense.

29 March 2023,An overhyped disaster .... :(,"Given all of the Academy Awards accolades, my wife and I had great expectations for this film. What we found instead was a loosely based storyline regarding a mother wanting to regain her relationship with her daughter, while somehow caught up bouncing between universes. Ninety percent of the movie is spent jumping around unexplainably and bizarrely from universe to universe without any storyline cohesion, as if the story tellers were striving to see how many weird scenes they could fit into the movie's 2hr -19min runtime. My wife and I looked at each other repeatedly asking ""where is this going?"" and ""is it over yet?"". Yes, the performances by the key actors were good given the material, but the movie itself was a total waste of time, never to be seen again. Ironically, Top Gun Maverick - which was the film truly deserving of Oscar recognition and which brought viewers back to theaters - didn't get on the Academy's radar. Instead, their votes went to this disaster.

11 April 2022,Don't be fooled by the rating; this movie is awful.,"I was so disappointed in the film, that I actually took the time to confirm my email address in order to leave a review. Completely borrowed storyline, basically a spoof of the Marvel multi-verse concept. Ridiculous, bizarre, shock-value stunts throughout, with no real meat or heart to the plot. Cliche and predictable ending. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is that they *tried* to have a feel-good movie about life choices and regrets, but it leaves way too much to be desired.

I don't understand the good rating whatsoever- usually IMDB is spot on, but not this time. Avoid this movie at all costs.

14 March 2023,Why so Many Oscars? Wasted my precious time.,"Really unsure how did this movie get so many Oscars... billions of people in the world will waste their precious time watching this rubbish movie because of Oscar hype like I did. How did it also get 7 Oscars? Don't waste your time. Boring movie with multiverse concepts going haywire.

Oscar folks please do your job properly next year and don't Rob people's precious hours by recommending movies like this.

The movie was so boring that I had to watch the movie in multiple days. I however watched the movie in my third sitting and the story, the make ups, animations etc makes no sense. And how is this movie a sci-fi movie! It's a bad categorisation. Humorous May be at some places but a childish humour in my opinion. I usually don't rate movies bad, but I had to rate it for those who haven't watched it yet. Don't bother watching and don't waste your time. Watch something else - don't go with Oscar awards hype - that's the lesson learnt for me with this one.",1
8 April 2023,Tried really hard,"I get what they were trying to achieve. As the mother of 2 daughters, as a Mum you try to be everything, everywhere, all at once.

Just missed the mark. By a few universe.

Jumps around so much it's hard to keep up.

No idea what the hot dog fingers are all about. Seemed a bit of a stretch.

Cinema-photography was good. Michelle Yeoh was also amazing in her role. It jus seems the story line tried to pack too much in.

Not sure how this won so many Oscars. Love love love JLC but don't know how she won an Oscar for this, think she was on screen for 20 mins tops. So many other more deserving roles she has played.

Overall. Disappointing.",4
18 March 2023,Asian porography won 7 Oscars AMPAS,"Blame Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that at 95th Academy Awards, gave an Asian porography picture 7 Oscars. I wanted to see who AMPAS awarded this year, 2023. Fortunately for me, in order not to waste my time with messes, I scanned this so called film, and I came across a more than disgusting scene, euphemistically speaking. On wikipedia, you'll found ""absurdist comedy-drama film"". I didn't understand where the comedy was. The scene is absurd, really. But what I saw next, was a mud stain, on the whole activity of the Academy. Like Jack Nicholson said ""I guess this proves there are as many nuts in the Academy as anywhere else."" They are totally out of their minds to give 7 Oscars. The producers made a movie according to their level of intelligence and unbalanced mental level. They are not to be blamed: they were, are and will be, all kinds of crazy people in this world. To blame is Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that awarded them.

26 February 2023,Worst movie,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

17 March 2023,Only Worth An Oscar In An Alternate Reality,"Wanted to like it as a I like the actors in it, but it was a lousy cable B movie at best. I have never been in such disagreement with people who felt this incoherent mess was worthy of an Oscar in my life! I'd like to ask anyone who felt it was a good movie specifically what they enjoyed so much? It made Jackie Chan's the Tuxedo look like the Godfather. The only thing that didn't make me want to turn it off was the idea of alternate universes, but I enjoyed the execution of that idea much better in the latest Spiderman film. I can only assume the real talent behind this mess of a film is whoever ran it's Oscar campaign. As to individual appeal it must cater to the taste of minds as jumbled as the film itself.

25 March 2023,Not really that original,"Was really looking forward to watching this but was hugely disappointed. This just felt like another Hollywood liberal moral finger wagging project. Why can't we all just get along. I'm so misunderstood. Nothing about the journey in this movie was significantly insightful or revealing. The characters didn't change that much either. There have been plenty other movies about time and space that were much more interesting. There have been plenty other better movies about love and understanding and redemption. Like plenty other reviewers I agree it has been way over hyped. Every time I saw it promoted it was described as an indescribable story. I found it pretty easy to follow and pretty easy to see what the film was trying to promote. Really glad Xfinity showed this as one of their free this week movies cause I almost shelled out $20 last week and that would probably have made me rate this movie even lower.

26 November 2022,Extended Vine Gag,"The cinematography was aesthetically and visually stunning but it didn't save this movie from being an extended Vine. Insulting stereotypes (so much so they had to go back and change a characters name), disgusting sexual gags, and corney morals all mashed into a Hollywood budget (that couldn't save this movie). I had to look up the directors to make sure they were both over 18 because I felt a lack of maturity.

I will commend the actors for what they put into it despite all the stupidness going on around them. Still they couldn't prevent it from going off the rails. Great to see James Hong tho'. Like always, he eats up every scene.

Unfortunately I can't pull out examples because I really didn't understand what was going on for 90% of the film or what they dubbed ""Chapter 1"". Then hastily wrapped things up in seven or so minutes in ""chapter 2"" üòí See the imbalance here.

So yeah, I perplexed at the 8+ rating. Must be a ton of pubescent boys trolling this site.",1
13 March 2023,Oscar is a joke!,"How could they have given 7 oscars to this irritating and extremely poorly written piece of ""movie""?

This movie proves that hollywood hasn't changed, it's still the same madness as usual, not that in the old days there weren't overrated, exaggerated and poorly written movies that also won oscars, but they never won as many statues as this meaningless mess I bet the audience for this edition must have been even lower than last year.

This movie is a mess, it's all over the place (literally), the acting is nothing but decent, it sucks, it's overrated, and it's extremely boring most of the time.

14 March 2023,WTH,"I've always been a film fan. I can appreciate sub-text, nuance and metaphor as well as the next person. Or at least I thought I could, Because I don't get this 7 times Academy award winning film at all. In my opinion it's quite simply boring and repetitive. Maybe it perked up at the end; I didn't make it that far.

Whichever universe you're in I think this will be equally boring and irritating. Apparently the critics enjoyed it. Or maybe they got their 13 year old kids to watch it for them? Because that's the only audience I can imagine (barely) enjoying this film. A real example of 'emperor's new clothes'. In my opinion, of course.

12 July 2023,So bad,"By far the dumbest movie I've tried watching. I've stopped watching it 3 times but every time I decided to give it another chance. It got worse and worse so eventually I stopped watching it altogether, couldn't see it to the end. How it received so many awards is beyond me. If this is what passes for Oscars now, then Oscars have set a very low bar. I guess this is what appeals to the young audience right now, and when I say young, I mean teenagers. I don't think any adult in their right mind would want to waste time on this stupidity. If this is the best that the film makers have to offer, then the film making is dead.

13 March 2023,Unwatchable,"Well, this is as far from Seventh art as it is Earth from Andromeda galaxy. It is simply unwatchable and anyone who tells you otherwise is full of BS. Hollywood is in a deep crisis, that's obvious. No ideas, no good scripts, it's all about CGI nowadays, but at least they could have kept the decency to evaluate the movies properly. Shame on you academy. As for the movie, there's really no point of describing it, you will have identical experience while watching your washing machine doing centrifuge. So, do not bother and forget about it like it never existed. I'm pretty sure that Fellini and Bergman are turning in their graves. Cheers.

* It's lot of abstract allegorical metaphors to illustrate the extremely intense dynamics in families - between mothers & daughters especially.

* If you do not like abstract art, you will hate this. It is basically live action abstract art.

* In spite of understanding it, I'm still glad I only spent $2.15 to rent this . . .

14 March 2023,Mildly Funny,"So the Oscar winner for best picture is a mildly entertaining and mildly funny comedy with a story that is, well, how to describe it, nonsense trying to look smart. I for sure can enjoy nonsense but it must be entertaining and here Everything Everywhere All at Once fails - I wasn't engaged, entertained nor was my neural network on fire but, well, most of the time watching I was half asleep or my mind wandered off (maybe in some alternative reality or dimension). Like Babylon, Everything Everywhere All at Once got a few good fun moments, but that this one got the Oscar award of best movie - like Coda last year (also a rather mediocre and overpraised movie) - leaves me rather perplexed. The production is okay but nothing remarkable, the acting mostly solid. I'm pretty sure a decade earlier, neither Everything Everywhere All at Once nor Coda would have been nominated, and winning? I don't believe so.

15 September 2022,Brilliant and boring,"That just about sums it up. Wonderfully acted and directed and shot but I was just bored throughout. It might be the multi-universe thing - how implicated can we be if 'nothing matters'? How can we care about a character if the character is one of thousands of versions of themselves? How can we bothered how a story ends or whether someone dies or not if all possible endings exist in the totality of universes? Well, we can't. And who was 'the baddie' and why were they trying to take over the world (or whatever it was they were trying to do or for whatever reason they had to be fought)? I don't know. As a philosophy BA and a lover of 'boring' films - Antonioni, anyone? - I had great expectations for this one but they simply weren't met.

13 August 2022,Unnecessarily complicated and confusing,"Some Chinese movies are made intentionally complicated and confusing because the directors want to show off their ""high"" skills. Otherwise they are afraid people will say it's too simple. On the other hand, many good movies are very simple and not much complicated plots. The performing skills of actors/actresses are the key of successful movies. The movie also has a very weak ending. Too many morals mean no moral.

5 March 2023,A piece of garbage,"I could not believe the positive high ratings for this movie. My spouse and I walked out of a theater half way through this film because it was so awful and this was before it became noted. We tried to watch it again online after it was nominated for a best film Oscar thinking we had missed something. It is even worse on a second viewing. If you hated this movie you are not alone. You are simply guilty of good taste. This movie deserves a Raspberry not an Oscar.

This is one of the worst films in cinematic history. Avoid this travesty at all cost. I cannot describe how terrible this film is. Under The Rainbow and Mr. Mike's Mondo Video are classics in comparison. Ed Wood deserves an Oscar before the director of this movie deserves one. Awful film. Avoid.

23 May 2022,A weird movie that tries to hard,"I dont know how to feel about this movie. After I saw it, I felt the need to give it a 8. I also feel the need to give it a 2. What was I watching really?

Movie plot and character motivation felt very lacking. Or well, almost non-existant. Story was mediocre at best. Acting was rather good. The storyline was decent but the development and progression of it was awful.

This movie mixes 2 genres that in my book wont really mix that well; Action/sci-fi and drama/deep meaning. Its not awful but it's certainly not a masterpiece either.

It relies on an attempt of great mature storytelling, trying to explain the true purpose of life, which is fine. And in the next scene people are jumping on buttplugs or tries to forcefully pee themself.

Just an incoherent mess with some of the worst acting i've ever encountered from all involved.

If this is what Hollywood is giving awards to then they have lost the plot big style.

It signals the end of an era in which there has been so much great entertainment. Nothing ever lasts forever but in the case of this nonsense it should never have existed in the first place.

It makes me wish I lived in an alternate reality, one in which this film doesn't exist!

4 February 2023,If a character has to explain the plot then the film fails,"I was curious to watch this movie because I had heard good things about it and I am a big fan of Michelle Yeoh. I was very disappointed by this mess of a movie. It started off well enough but then devolved into a series of jarring story shifts that overwhelmed any coherent story being told. Several times in the movie Evelyn's guide in an alternate universe delivers a rambling summary of what is going on. If a character in a film has to explain what is going on in the film then the filmmaker has failed in their primary task: making the film coherent to the audience. There is way too much dialogue attempting to describe what is going instead letting the story unfold on its own. The premise of the plot is interesting, but the story in the mind of the director was not translated before the camera effectively.

26 January 2023,Emperors New Clothes,"After all the praise and Oscar nods, and being a film buff of sorts, I thought I'd best watch this... and OMG, its really rubbish!

Its like a bad chinese movie of the 80s, with money thrown at it, spliced with Matrix/Multiverse theories willy nilly.

Michelle Yeoh, as always was amazing, but a very poor script and bad storyline there is nothing that can be done to save this movie.

In my opinion, I think the Oscar elites are thinking they are being clever in nominating this movie in so many categories, because they are somehow enlightened individuals who see so many levels in this film, but the truth is, Emperors New Clothes - there is nothing good to see as there is nothing good here!

20 February 2023,2GenZ4U,"The film strikes a good balance between stimulus overload and actually having a lesson to teach. Although the moral of the story has been told before, it is the mind bending form that sets this film apart. Though the film gets conceptual (and quirkily random UwU) really quickly, it does so with clarity and grace - Nolan take note. On the other hand, it does lose pace in the middle and desperately reiterates the same point. (Kinda like a kid telling a joke and asking if you got it, numerous times.) Also the setting gets a bit mundane as the film progresses.

All in all, the experience is worth it as the film attempts a striking a deeper note by allowing character transformations and reappraisals, something it's younger target audience can do well to follow.

27 March 2023,Just another Hong Kong action movie but more expensive,"I am so disappointed. Watched the film because I thought it was worth all thr Oscars. However, it wasn't. The story isn't new. The jokes are ok, but they don't make you die of laughter. Pictures are ok, sound effects are ok But not great. The emotions is the worst part. And the touching moment, oh, they try hard to make you cry but it was so boring. It wasn't touching. 7 Oscars, seriously? I'm not surprised that it's successful at the cinema, but the Oscars, really?

It can be a good movie to have fun with friends on Saturday evening, but I definitely won't watch it again. I would love to see the Oscar to be more inclusive, but I think they are forcing too hard.

20 January 2023,Nihilistic twaddle,"I watch a lot of movies and take the time to watch those that are thought provoking more than once.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is a very special as this is the first film that I have watched twice and can only conclude that in hindsight, I wish I had watched it zero times. This movie is a mess. It takes nihilism to the next level. I cannot ever recall watching such rubbish and trust me, I have seen some extremely bad movies over the years. Even with such a great leads with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan at the helm of this sinking ship. There is no turning the tide. This is one ship that needs to be torpedoed, as at 139 minutes, it is taking far to long to go down. I suspect that most Millennials will love it (though not this one), as it takes pretentiousness to new levels. If you are curious to see for yourself, watch the first thirty minutes and you have seen the whole movie. Just remember, it is thirty minutes that you will never get back.

The movie has A LOT of glaring continuity goofs and plot holes. Nobody in this world believes this deserves the best picture and best director awards. I still remember seeing Evelyne's ring in one hand and then the same ring in the other hand, that is very glaring, and everybody saying wtf in my screening... I strongly believe this is a click-bait, paid media awards driven thing. Absolutely believe that the academy just watch reels, not the entire movies. Like The Hurt Locker this is absurd, forgettable garbage. 1/10.

But if this is the best Hollywood can produce, they need to get out of politics and go back to making better movies. I cannot believe this was the best thing produced all year! What a mess. I guess Jamie Lee Curtis pressed enough hands to finally get herself an Oscar for playing dress-up. She was good but Oscar-worthy? Please!!!!

I can't even figure out who the intended audience would be for this movie. It insults the intelligence of adults, not quite super hero material, and too violent for children.

The only reason we watched the whole dragged out, 2 hour 10 minute movie is because we thought it had to get better since it won an Oscar. We were wrong.

Rotten tomatoes should have given it less than 50 percent, I have no clue why it won Best Picture, it was free to watch, of which I'm glad, because if I hadn't been watching it with someone, I'd have turned it off. Come on Academy Awards, just because it was different, does that make it good? I don't think so.

It's a mess! It really is everything, everywhere, all at once. But it's one of those movies where it seemed the shoom rip fell off and they tried to remain edgy. Until it reached a point quite beyond ""Really? This is not an organic mind altering/expanding experience.""

Maybe the people just failed to properly translate their trip. Like a song in a dream. Or like when I actually was able to translate my dream songs they ended up sucking quite badly.

In any case, this experience failed for me. But the core message was nice. However, a majority of the theater left mid-show this time. And I had no questions on why.

It's always fascinating to me how much people's opinions differ. Contrary to the laudatory reviews, the film has very little substance and message. The creators laid the foundations, but did not fill it with content, the conclusion is quite a cliche, and yes, in the end, life is a bunch of old truisms that can be deep and charming in their simplicity if the road leading to them, is real. But this film quickly gets lost in a madly spinning merry-go-round of colors, movements, words, and sounds. You can cut half of the movie and it won't change the message or the ending, the movie is 40 minutes too long. This isn't coherent vision at all and it just leaves you confused and with a headache. Someone may say that this form is intentional because that's exactly how life is, but sorry, the creators can't get a pass so easily. If you claim you made a movie with a real message it's your job to make the audience care, to show something that is raw and true not bore people to death and just throw random things around over and over again.

Everything Everywhere All at Once is in the end tedious and loud, and it leaves you with very little not some grand wisdom.

It's absolutely not an 8, 9 or 10. It's technically and visually well done, but the story itself pretends to be more profound than it really is. This is def one of the most overrated movies this year.",2
19 March 2023,Pathetic Trash/Sorry I made you finish it,"I know better than to let awards tempt me into watching a film. Any reviewer that liked this repetitive, chaotic, and confusing excuse of a film is simply trying to appear to be uniquely aware of hidden messages and full of deep intellect. I say that this movie is complete nonsense. I know trash when I see it. This was complete trash.

I made my spouse watch till the end hoping that something would tie the nonsense and chaos into a meaningful message. Never happened. I had to apologize. The pointless, never ending fight scenes were poorly made and tacky. I can enjoy a complex film with abstract presentations of real life messages and themes. This film didn't deliver anything but disappointment, confusion, and pure boredom. Don't fall for the awards credentials. They are 100% fake and unjustified in this case.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head.

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

1 April 2023,Marmite but did not deserve all the Oscar's,"I don't often leave reviews but this movie I had to. It's so overrated and for me tedious so much so I turned it off before the end. I wouldn't have watched it I only did so because of all the awards it received. Having watched all the other nominees of the other films this was by far the worst film and it's a travesty that the other nominees lost out to this movie. I will in future follow the Baftas which in my opinion got it right ! As I said it's marmite but I truly hated it.

Okay so have to continue to reach allotted words what more can I say ! Jamie Lee who I love totally overacts ! The guy from Raiders was the best but nothing compared to Elvis !

28 January 2023,INCREDIBLY OVERRATED!,"It's absolutely impossible to understand why critics and Hollywood considered this ridiculous and boring movie as one deserving to be recommended, or nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including the Best Picture category.

Even though the film has lots of expensive special effects, and good performances of the whole bunch of actors involved in it (including Jamie Lee Curtis' part as the IRS agent), it is absolutely void of any artistic essence.

While suffering watching this naive product, I was thinking about other films which had been nominated to several Oscars before, like the excellents ""BEN HUR"", ""GONE WITH THE WIND"", ""THE GODFATHER"", ""OUT OF AFRICA', ""LAWRENCE OF ARABIA"", ""PATTON"", ""THE DEER HUNTER"", ""APOCALYPSE NOW"", etc.; and came to the conclusion that films taste has unfortunately decayed through the years.

19 March 2023,The worst film of the year,"I never expected this time to come, when the dumbest movie won an Oscar. It's a joke when a movie about nothing wins. Nothing to say about the actors because Everyone is good in this movie. But the plot and direction were really such a mess. When a plot has anal toys or pointless hot dog fingers, that's rubbish. The beginning is very lazy and boring and then a crazy mess of times and Kung fu dances started. I believe it's a ploy to please the eastern world, or something like that. It would be a good movie because the theme of time and options in life could be very interesting. But no, nothing more than a carnival of images! Very bad.

13 March 2023,Its all about stupid viewers thinking they are smart by rating this movie highly,"This movie was an incredible slog to sit through.

It did have a moment or two. The acting was good.

People who are giving this movie high ratings, must be people who think they look smart by doing so.

Those who have some brains realize the parody, the ridiculously portrayed multiverse, and the meaning thereof, etc. Was just not all that good.

And, did we need to see 40 hours of fight scenes. It felt like 40 hours. It was tedious.

Maybe the movie received so many Academy Award votes was because many of the academy members, who are the voters, invested money in the film and are looking to increase their return.

13 November 2022,Not for me,"Matrix meets kung fu husstle in the multiverse. Nothing was outstanding in the movie. I got the Jokes but wasn't actualy funny for me. The humor in the flight scenes wasn't for me allthough that was probably the best scene in the movie. The title is correct but another title could be one big mess in the multiverse. Maybe i missed something. The actors did a good job because i do think this was the idea of the movie . So If you like a big mess the actors will not dissapoint. Looking at the other reviews either you like it or you hate it. Good luck If you want to watch. If you don't you will never know.

3 October 2022,Can't give a 0 .. utter garbage,"I created this account to write this review. I'm utterly gobsmacked at how many high ratings this film received.

Usually a rule for movie watching. No phones. Needless to say I was glued to mine whilst this garbage played. I have to say this. As a movie lover, I'm generally easy to please. This was hands down, the worse movie I ever sat through. Fight scenes were terrible and the story was unoriginal.

A fight scene with 18 inch dildos, and two men scrambling to jump onto objects to insert into their a$$? Cmon. Utter garbage. Wish there was a multiverse where I didn't watch this and I could teleport into my own body to save that last 2.5 hours which felt like 5.

Do not waste your time. Seriously. Consider this fair warning.

Switches between Chinese and English (I don't speak Chinese) To many flashbacks going from one scene to another. Too much ludicrous violence. If I could give this film a zero I would, it doesn't deserve a 1! How this film ever won an award,I don't know! It goes from one Kungfu fight to another. What redeeming qualities does this movie have? It is exhausting to watch! Where is the storyline? What life lessons are to be learned here? Absurd, ridiculous,farcical violence! This movie is more like several video games spliced together. This movie promotes violence!

2 February 2023,Utter nonsense,"""I recently watched a film that can only be described as utter nonsense, and I have to say, it was quite the experience. From start to finish, this film was a wild ride of bizarre events and nonsensical plot twists that left me scratching my head in disbelief. The characters were equally absurd, with their actions and dialogue making little to no sense.

Despite its lack of coherence, the film managed to keep me entertained throughout. The over-the-top humor and absurd visuals made for a truly unique viewing experience that I won't soon forget.

If you're looking for a film that defies all logic and reason, and is just a fun, silly romp, then this nonsense film is definitely worth checking out. Just don't expect to make sense of it all, because this film is all about embracing the absurdity.

Overall, I would rate this nonsense film a 2 out of 10 for its entertaining value and memorable viewing experience, but deduct points for its complete lack of structure and coherence."" Well, these are the words of the infamous ChatGpt AI.",2

Oh boy... It's just another Matrix, Inception movie.

About: A Chinese lady living in the USA is drawn into random stuff. Why? I don't know.

Story and production: it's another confusing sown up movie. Why? Who? What? Is happening I can not answer.

The quality I good. It's a creative movie.

The Wayne guy and some parts reminds me of William Janus from South Park. Where William Janus turns out to be Tuong Lu Kim who has multiple personality disorder.

Overall, a creative movie though its confusing me.

Genre: Sci-Fi, Chinese.

Soundtrack: It good.

Duratiom: 2 long bloody hours...

What can be learned? Do you really control your reality?

Should you watch this? Meh... If your confused by Matrix and Inception then that's what you'll Get. A headless dog... Haha!

Can you tell I am angry?

I AM ANGRY.

This film did not have ANYTHING that resembled a cohesive story.

My husband suggested we watch this quagmire on a Saturday morning. How I wish I could have those two and a half hours back! I've seen some weird movies in my time, but this just really takes the cake. I truly think the script writers were on acid when writing this. Truly, madly, deeply disappointed in this mess.

I suppose there is room in the universe for a movie like this: Two hours of nonstop A/V assault on the viewer. A thin plot, endlessly restated.

Heed my warning, gentle viewer. Set aside two hours of your life for literally any other purpose. Meditate. Pet a dog. Do the dishes. Read to blind orphans. Then congratulate yourself for dodging the bullet that is this movie.

Do not, under any circumstances, watch this movie. I do not believe any of the people who birthed this movie are inherently evil or beyond redemption, but they need to seriously reexamine why they are on this earth.

22 May 2022,Don't waste your time.,"45 min in, turned it off as it was getting annoying.

Cringe level: high.

The premise build is vaguely strung together via flashbacks that are literally flashes. Language is near impossible to follow as mixed with chinese and english and only partial subs (for the chineses).

Scenes are very short with incoherent dialogue. There is very little flow in any scene. Granted there is a lot going on, but it equates to a rather incoherent jumble of mediocre scenes and dodgy cinematography struggling to build anything resembling a storyline.

The storyline that does transpire is neither inviting or interesting.

This is one of those films where you wonder what anyone involved with the production was thinking. If this is what the editors could muster as a final version, then how bad must have the overall direction been?

The level of discomfort felt for the actors being required to enact the script, assuming there actually was one, was significant.

How this film can receive positive acclaim is bewildering.

3 November 2022,Dumping trash,"Stale plot with action-packed visual give rise to a movie that aims to simulate the audience. The goals of the writers is to explore the unimaginable... resulting in weird things and ideas.

There are aspects of Asian-American lifestyle that I experience myself. The characters also act in a very raw manner. Blurting out words and phrases in Chinese for example. I thought the beginning of the movie showcases the Asian-American lifestyle.

But, the film does downhill from there. The pacing increases, visuals pop-up, and the film ends with some open-ended idea.

Who knows that you are supposed to learn from this?

26 January 2023,"I'm Sorry, but I Just Can't","I just couldn't get through it. How this film fetched so much attention is more shocking to me than how the Avatar films became so popular. The film, mimicking typical Hollywood films, consists of two plus hours of unintentional ridiculousness and ham-fisted moralism about accepting people, regardless of how odd their oddities happen to be. The film especially lays it on with regard to child-rearing, specifically, how traditionalist parents have an obligation to simply accept their children's novel additions to their family's moral culture and sensibilities. It fails to so much as consider the question of whether children could be wrong or hasty in their changes (they are children after all), or whether the children should work with parents to evaluate them. Here, parents are simply obligated to ""get with the times"" and support the child's wishes lest they push the child toward evil.

The two redeeming qualities of this film are the gravitas brought by the lead actor (she is excellent), and the strange sense that I experienced in viewing the actor who played her husband. I am going out on a limb in saying this before checking it, but I think he is the same person who played a little boy in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" It was a bit haunting to hear him speak, now as an aging man, with the same inflections of voice and general mannerisms of the child of nearly forty years ago. Other than these items, I can't see clear to lionize this film as so many have done.",2

30 May 2022,Incomprehensible Confusiion,"Basically an exercise in post-modern cinematography, ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" lives up to its tenet that ""nothing matters"" by ignoring elements such as a plot. Character development is dispensed with by giving each actor multiple characters with both good and evil qualities. Watching this picture could be dangerous for those susceptible to epileptic incidents or subject to migraine headaches.

22 January 2023,Nothing Nowhere Never Again!,"Wow! With all the awards hype around this movie I expected to at least be mildly entertained. I was not. It is relentlessly over wrought, banal and narratively obsequious. Not worth reviewing frankly. What is going on with movies these days? Remember when 'Nomadland' won best picture? That was weird but you could blame it on the pandemic. Maybe if I saw it in a theatre where I'd be trapped into making more of an investment. This makes my list of worst movies ever. After the first ten minutes I paused the movie only to discover that I was forty five minutes in! All I could think of is what decisions had I made in my life that found me in a portion of the multiverse where this is considered a good movie! Yikes!

1 February 2023,I'm in the middle of watching it and just come here to check if I am the only one disappointed.,"Turned out I am not. I've rolled my eyes, felt embarrassed and cringed multiple times so far. The storyline is a mess. I guess they try to make it philosophical and profound but they really went way way to far into the abyss of confusion and nonsense. I'm Taiwanese so I can understand every Mandarin sentence perfectly and this makes watching it even more painful. I don't think this movie will stand the test of time and I think its right score will be four point something. Hugely overrated. Now I will go back and finish it. This is the kind of person I am but I guess I will have to find creative ways to amuse myself to hang on to the end. To those of you who really finished watching it, you deserve a big hand for your incredible tolerance of bad movies. It's slow death.

15 May 2023,Worst film I have ever had to sit through,"It is hard to fathom why such amazing actors, who have delivered some of the most unforgettable performances in cinema history, would agree to participate in a project so devoid of creativity and originality.

This sci-fi movie was the epitome of rubbish. The special effects were poor, the plot was uninspired, and the pacing was sluggish. It required a great deal of patience to make it to the end, and even then it failed to deliver any payoff. It was easy to see why it would be a great movie for someone trying to torture answers from their prisoners because it was pure torture to watch. It is perplexing how such talented actors could be involved in such an utter disappointment of a movie. It is best to avoid this film at all costs.

18 May 2023,A movie best watched stoned,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

7 March 2023,Horrible,"What to say? Waste of my time...

I cannot believe I survived until the end. The story is nonsense and the only good part is the special effects (thus the rate 2 out of 10).

Seriously, why is this movie in the oscar nominations? Pointless.

Two hours and a half of kung fu fighting with random objects, silly humor, mom and daughter relationship and crazy effects.

That is literally all there is. The plot is silly and the end is also bad.

Try not to waste your time with this. I have no idea why people hype this s*.

Waste of time, I wish I could have my 2h30 back so I could do something worth.",2
3 September 2023,Can't Believe This Won Best Picture,"I wanted to see this since it had such rave reviews. Honestly cannot believe this movie won for Best Motion Picture. It was a decent movie, reminded me of a 21st century sci fi version of the Wizard of Oz, but just all over the place. The entire time I was watching it, I kept saying ""I can't believe this won best picture."" Michelle did a great job...loved her since Crouching Tiger...very iffy on Jamie Lee Curtis winning supporting actress...out of all the movies she's been it, I didn't see it with this one. It was a good Saturday night movie, don't think I will watch again. Just wasn't my cup of tea.

7 March 2023,Cab I give it a negative rating?,"I was completely confused by whatever that was I was watching. I had no idea what was supposed to be going on, or what all the fuss was about. The fact I made it 15 minutes before shutting it off surprises me. I wanted to stop sooner, but kept waiting for something, anything, to keep my interest. Unfortunately that never happened. I'm upset I wasted that much time on this mindless nonsense. It did leave me with one great hope. If this piece of garbage can win so many awards, whats to stop me from writing the next great piece of mindless drivel and becoming rich? I'll tell you what. I will look at it again, just to see how easy it can be to come up with a nonsensical idea that will win awards and fool people the world over!

18 May 2022,This movie starts off promising and ends up bad 3/10,"I truly wanted to enjoy this movie especially after the first 25 minutes, but then it just ends up being trite, boring, pedestrian rubbish. It's not convoluted, it's easy to follow, but my lord it takes forever to get anywhere with substance.

This movie could easily have been and hour and 25 minutes long and better for it, though it would still have been childish nonsense in the main.

Have to say this; just because the movie is bad, doesn't mean all the acting is, the acting is the best part of the movie.

8 June 2022,I'll never get that time back.,"Where should i start? For me this movie was a complete disaster. I went to see it on the ratings from imdb and boy were they wrong for me. 2 hours 20 minutes for a final reconciliation that they could have done five minutes into the movie. I don't usually do ""other peoples trips"" but in rare instances they can be mesmeric just like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or The Matrix 1. But for me this didn't work at all. The acting was seriously poor, the comedy was juvenile, it was difficult to follow rambling from one scene to the next and it was way too long. The worst part was when some of the actors began to put pointed ornaments in their backsides. It wasn't funny but rather childish and crude. But all this is just my opinion. I heard people behind me say they enjoyed it and thats fair enough. Maybe something extra to enhance the experience was necessary but for me im just sorry i actually paid for the experience in time and money. If there were a minus on the scale id give it -10.

19 March 2023,"""it's a wonderful life"" ... on crack!","I've never done heavy drugs but I'm sure an acid trip is equivalent to what I just watched. It was like the Matrix meets It's a Wonderful Life meets the 90s TV show Sliders... all on really heavy drugs. I kept hoping for an explanation or an understanding as to what the heck was happening... but it never came. I have no idea how this won best picture. Nothing against the actors, they all did a wonderful job considering what they were asked to portray. I'm sitting here, writing this seconds after just finishing the movie and I still couldn't tell you what I just watched. Save yourself the 2.5 hrs and watch something else. Thank me later.

8 April 2023,This is my first review - I just need to unleash my amazement,"This is my first review. I simply just cannot understand all the hipe about this movie. It's a chaotic mashup of massive nonsense put up in a extremely camp and cheesy way.

The acting is very good (and my 5 stars are due to that) but I'm sure other actors deserved to get the academy awards more than the three that work in this movie and got them.

Technically the movie is overwhelming -but not in the right way. The cinematography and the visual effects are confusing, cloying, and sometimes stunningly cheap.

The music is just fine.

The storyline is a compost of absurdities that end up in an astonishingly sickly-sweet, mawkish, tricky and fake fable about love and acceptance.

I definitely think humanity has gone bananas. This movie and its success and the awards that it got are just another little evidence.",5
4 June 2022,"Like most A24 movies, this is another extremely overhyped pile of trash","The 8.4 score is unjustified. The movie has nothing going for it. The comedy is predictable. The story is boring. The telling of the story is amateurish. The characters are stereotypical. The length of the movie is too long for the substance that's there to work with.

I would rather watch paint dry than to watch this steaming pile of garbage.

18 March 2023,"What the...? How can this ""motion picture"" win so many awards?","I don't usually write reviews. If I watch a movie till the end I will rate it a 10 or 9( if it annoys me too much, but not enough to become unbearable-like Gravity for example ). If it becomes unbearable, I simply stop watching it and don't bother rating. I will make an exception now because of the many awards this movie won.

What the...?

When a fish-like thingy had intimal relations with a woman in the Best Motion Picture of the Year in 2018, I was very disappointed but, hey,.. it's art, right?

But this movie is making me really worried. Will we allow competitiveness to stop being the fundamental drive of our society? Will our decisions become agenda dependent? Will we praise paintings done by throwing... paint( I know what you were thinking of and you were not wrong :) ) on canvases? This is an utterly bad movie, everyone knows it, but to be so overrated? How did we end up here? I think the Judgement at Nuremberg 's ending shows us the path we are walking on.

This review does not contain any spoiler, as it is nothing to spoil.",1
10 June 2023,Embarrassing,"The movie starts with an interesting script and aesthetics, which misleads you to think it's going to be a good movie. Until they enter in the IRS building I was into it, despite nothing substantial had happened yet. At this point, the characters are introduced satisfyingly enough so you think a good movie is about to start.

Was downhill from there.

In the first minutes in the IRS building scenes I thought it was going to be perhaps a movie about mental illness, or that the main character was having a seizure or something.

But then I discover that a seizure from cringing was what I was about to have.

It was just absolutely cringe.

Despite liking the costumes in particular, that were very creative for an action movie, the plot is just downright bad, boring and messy. The movie is not funny enough, it takes itself too seriously and makes an obvious point as if it was a incredible spiritual insight.

By the way, the only good acting was from Michelle, the other actors were mediocre and some of them even cringe, and I just cannot believe this movie swept all the Oscars of 2022. By the way, I loved Midsummer and don't aligned with the haters of A24. But this movie was just bleh.

Sad that Banshees of Inisherin, so well acted, softly moving and at the same time dramatically violent, a tale for the days we live, didn't won the deserving recognition that was otherwise given to this overrated movie...",1
14 January 2023,Truly bizarre & awful,"This film is like a sci fi Jackie Chan film, & that's not good.

Quite simply it's bizarre with a plot from a B movie sci fi film from the 1950's that makes little sense.

It's bound to have a cult following in the same way The Firth Element does, an equally bizarre & awful film.

You can't fault the acting but the script & plot are woeful. As is the way it jumps around all over the place between the 'multi verses' with same actors playing multiple versions of themselves in the same place & the same time.

Confused? You will be.

It also comes across as just being.... silly.

So bizarre, confusing, awful, woeful & silly.",2
19 November 2022,Everything everywhere for no reason,"I had high expectations for this movie, but it was pointlessly confusing to a point that it got annoying. I can see why some people might like it, but not my cup of tea. I enjoy fast paced movies, but this movie seemed fast paced for the sake of it. I don't get the 8.1 rating, for me it below average, especially when it comes to plot and screenplay. The dialog is just cringy and pointless. The whole metaverse concept seems to be used more and more recently, unfortunately most times badly with the aimjust to impress the viewer.

Short review: confusing, pointless, empty, bright, fast paced. A cornucopia of plastic candy, looks exciting from far away, but disappointing when you get closer to it.

10 March 2023,One of the more accurate portrayals of a nightmare captured in a movie,"Oscar megabuzz made me find out what the fuss is all about. Free on prime at the moment, so let's go.

Self styled zany/wacky directing duo the ""Daniels"" ... present an unusual take on female midlife crisis.

The title character, raised in Asia but living in America, is coming to terms with a stressful time in her life. Her business under investigation by tax officials, a failing relationship with her husband, and having to accept her daughter's homosexuality. This plays out in the movie as a kind of anxiety fuelled fever dream, where you guessed it, ""everything all at once"" occurs.

We are then inundated with scene after scene of chaotic imagery, not unlike a vivid lucid dream we all have experienced at some point. Yeoh's everywoman character is somehow on a mission to defeat the ""bad guy"" through travelling multiverses, aka a metaphor for anxiety (infinite what if? Scenarios). It seems to follow a similar theme to the original Matrix, with value added bizarreness and sassy/crude attempts at humour, which makes me think intent might have been a kind of spoof of this trope.

And my review ends here. Have to admit, I didn't make it to the end, a particular plug-based sex toy scene was just too much to spend another hour of my life on it. Not for me, thanks.

Tl;Dr: Tick the boxes: Middle aged female leads Asian-american average family life Gay daughter Sci fi fantasy elements Is it unique? Absolutely Is it original? Kind of Is it entertaining? Maybe to some, polarising

Is it Oscar worthy?

Absolutely not for any of the main awards and would make a mockery of the academy if they were to give it any. Watch a past winner after this and you too should come to the same conclusion.",3
23 February 2023,Love it and Hate it.,"Great performances by the key cast members in an original presentation of unoriginal ideas. In structure it is a very conventional 'Heroes Journey' with all of the required elements of the reluctant hero, her quirky new friends and an ever growing, life threatening challenge. Some very cute moments and ideas, such as the 'everything bagel', but it ran out of ideas after an hour and just relied on never ending jumpcuts of combat scenes. As such, it could have been cut down to one hour instead of its totally unnecessary 2:20. Credits to the editor for the massive amount of work in putting this together, but after the first hour, the story did not advance at all and the scene after scene after scene of pointless fights got tedious and boring.

There was also a problem with the premise of saving the infinite universes. I suppose the key character did, but the issue sort of fell off the edge of the table and was not addressed. If you have to blow up the death star to save the galaxy, then you need to show the death star being blown up. You don't go straight to the awards ceremony without showing us what happened.

So ya, some great stuff and a lot of tedious, pointlessness.",5
29 January 2023,worthless overhyped,"Don't waste your time with this worthless overhyped movie. It's bad. Packed with sensless violence. With non laughable humor. Flat personalities. Story is devoid of interesting turns. Nothing spiritually, no intellectual challenges just bad humor bad lines.

A total waste of time and money.

I fail to understand how this can be so overhyped. But then, in todays world its easy to manipulate ratings if you have enough money. The questions is why would you do this? Because the movie will bring you down to their low level of dissonance. And I even needed 600 words to make this review, so hereby I end.

3 February 2023,You can't please everyone,"This film proves the old adage that 'you can't please everyone' - not even everywhere and all at once. A mash up of Matrix/Parasite/and any Jackie Chan movie you care to name, this film simply doesn't work. It starts reasonably well, however, and in the first 30 minutes shows great promise. But then it degenerates into a farcical parade of kung-fu style dance routines that are not only boring but incredibly poorly choreographed. The premise of the film - some sort of interdimensional slippage brought on by stress and self-worth (or the lack of it) - as only explained in the most convoluted and bizarre way that one can only assume it is because the writers don't really want the viewer to know what's going on (clever eh? Not!). The Jackie Chan throw away comedy is laughable in its obviousness and the sight gags are childish to say the least. The acting is pretty good but then, what ARE they acting? No-one knows, least of all it seems the writers and the director! I suspect this film is doing well at the awards simply because, like the emperor's clothing, no-one in the 'arts' world is game enough to say they didn't get it (to admit, if you like, that they are not clever enough to divine this film's 'deep and meaningful message'. Well, folks, the joke's on them because there simply isn't one. This is a self-indulgent film editor's wet dream masquerading as something profound. In short, not worth the 2 hours invested in watching it.",3
8 February 2023,"2h30min ago I could swear I never did drugs. Now, not so sure","My mistake, I trusted an IMDB rating of 8.0 and thought this would be about an Asian family cultural conflict with US, or something along the lines. Did not watch the trailed.

The title made no sense but hey, artistic license, right? Wrong. The title is appropriate and descriptive of the movie.

I find the art in this movie is a thin brightly painted veneer over a rock tumbler, mixing and crushing any strand of narrative that may have inadvertently formed during shooting. It's like someone drunk trying to piece together last night's events. It feels heavy, pungent and ultimately hopeless. Flashing lights warning.

The whole movie could have been 5 minutes if the loopy kung-fu wannabee art, which felt mostly surplus quality, would be stripped away.

Fun factor: 6/10 akin to TikTok for 2h - you will laugh a bit Narrative: absent WTFs/hour: new world record Message: 2/10 Time management: nope, none Acting: decent.",3
26 March 2023,Everything and Nothing At All,"Call me whatever you want but that was the most tedious, boring, intellectually bereft movie I've seen since Mars Attacks. It was free on Showtime so I thought how lucky I was to be able to see this often awarded show for free. Afterwords I felt totally ripped off.

Editing had to be a nightmare and it looked that way almost from the beginning. The humor was butt plug level the martial arts were rarely decent (not that I'd know) but the movies overall message could have easily been communicated and many times more interesting in one 30 minute episode of Twilight Zone.

All I can say is what the Academy's choice of this film as Best Motion Picture Of The Year was a bigger disaster than THE SLAP from 2022.

I went with a friend who wanted to see it and even my friend said this movie was the weirdest movie she'd ever seen. We should have walked out.

21 June 2023,This movie made me so confused that I cringe while watching it...,"Being an Asian myself, having grown up watching Chinese Kungfu movies, and then Jackie Chan's Rush Hour, I understand how people, especially Americans, love Kungfu. And although Michelle Yeoh is very good at martial arts, and I also adored her for 'Memoirs of a Geisha', this is not a good Kungfu movie. The film's Kungfu performances are really boring and lifeless.

In terms of content, I find there are 3 aspects to evaluate this movie, one: the appeal of the story, two: the humor, the third: the emotion and the message.

About the story, the multiverse theory is explained in quite detail, but it seems that due to the low budget, what we see is only described through Waymond's words. And the little dots on the screen or whatever screen. It's too simple to enjoy. And the detail of the ear device for multiverse communication is ridiculous and meaningless. The character Becky and the grandpa ended up having no role at all, completely hopeless. Why is Joy the villain? The story goes on and on and forces the viewer to accept everything. The multiverse is something huge and has a very wide impact, but the story here revolves around only a few people? Wtf not to mention that there are some universes that are just created for the purpose of comedy and have no meaning, and that humor is, I will say, = Zero. I can't laugh a bit when I see the humor in this movie. If you want funny Kungfu movies, watch a movie by Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow.

Fortunately, this film has a message and emotion, which is the commendable point of the film. The editor of this movie is Paul Rogers and he deserves an Oscar, the universes are shown continuously, especially towards the end,the scenes are also constantly transferred between different universes making it nearly impossible for the viewer to adapt and keep up with what's going on everywhere, but the music ties it all together perfectly. I like the music in the movie. Especially at the end when the meaning of family is gracefully expressed. From the very beginning we know that family is the heart of the movie. Although everything is shown quite chaotic and a bit boring, but the feeling of family is well put so viewers can still feel it. But this is also what makes viewers like me feel quite uncomfortable, I don't know whether to enjoy this movie in a serious way or just for fun? So I would be quite hesitant if I want to watch this movie again. And although the acting of the actors are impressive, but 7 Oscars? Please... At this rate, in the years to come I'll probably stop believing in Oscars...",4
25 February 2023,Horrible dance movie,"Ok for 80 minutes. Then a shoe turns i to a snake (or similar), and the scenery changes, and you have long since understood the concept. And they continue to milk that until the utter is store, and the frustration builds. Then that goes on for an hour. They jump around and fight, ok but it gets old, allthough this raises it from an (impossible) zero to a one ind the rating.

Ok fight scenes and good actors.

The idea is good, but not revolutionary. Nothing like wathcing fx the matrix for the first time. Its like a dance movie with weird backgrounds and kung fu for the last hour. Horrible. Do not watch, unless you like dance movie, or specifically kung fu.

18 February 2023,What did I just watch!,"This is the strangest film I think I have ever seen, that being said I was compelled to keep watching when I didn't want to. Some of it made me feel uncomfortable whilst other parts made me confused but again I was 'forced' against my will to keep watching. I can't leave a legitimate and complete review because I don't know what else to say. It's strange, rubbish, magical, odd, watchable, terrible and wonderful all at the same time. I will never watch it again but will remember every part of it.

I'll say this though, the cast was superb and managed to make sense of a script written by either toddlers, junkies or geniuses. That's all I have!

Maybe the comedy worked at a different level to me, and everyone else in the auditorium but no one was laughing. 20 minutes in, I was trying to see where the film was going, 20 minutes later , i gave up and went home.

25 July 2022,Please don't waste your time,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

22 January 2023,Second-tier sci-fi/fantasy,"One couple I know walked out on it. Another friend loved it. They are all smart people with a good sense of humor. But it is also continually mentioned as a shoo-in at the Oscars. I feel that I had an open mind when I bought my ticket. The story, as far as I could tell, is about a Chinese-American woman who is kidnapped and thrown into alternate universes when she's overcome by stress. And that's what happens in this movie. He marriage is basically over, her daughter just came out as a lesbian, her ailing father, who lives with her and constantly criticizes her, demands attention. The family business (a laundromat) is failing, the IRS is harassing them, and she is haunted by her failed career as a singer. In the alternative universes she has superhuman strength and is a martial arts expert. That's a good thing because she's also being pursued by an arch-villainess who is determined to kill her off in every one of those alternative universes. There are a lot of fight scenes (mostly CGI). There are also some laughs along the way, but nothing truly hilarious, unless you like jokes about sticking objects where-the-moon-don't-shine. I guess it comes down to the fact that this is just not my kind of movie. The audience I saw it with was composed mostly of young people who seemed to enjoy it enormously. The makeup was outstanding. I did not recognize Jamie Lee Curtis at all. Since most people confuse acting with makeup, I predict that she'll win the Oscar. But ultimately, to me, it was just silly.",4
14 March 2023,"Really, really bad","I will almost never stop watching a movie, but this was so bad, I actually gave up. Some of the performances were solid, but the overall story was just plain unbelievable, and bad. Not even worth the hour and a half I gave it. I really wanted to like it, and my favorite performances were by Jamie Lee, and the really cool actor who started his journey in Temple of Doom. I was happy to see Jamie Lee Curtis finally win an Oscar, so many great performances she was snubbed for, but she finally got one, and I would say her performance was a highlight of my wasted time watching this strange film, it really could have been monumentally better, but casting was it's greatest accomplishment.

15 March 2023,As some critic wrote:,"""There's lots to recommend about Everything Everywhere All at Once, but the film's frenetic busy-ness wore me down"". (Max Weiss)

Me? First movie hour was great, next hour and 19 minutes bored me to death. For me the academy wanted to encourage asian-movies-actors to keep up in the industry. The same thing that they did in the past with color people to whom they ignored big time. In my opinion this movie didn¬¥t deserve so many oscars in different categories and much less best movie award.

May be I¬¥m wrong but didn¬¥t like it, but in the other hand The Banshees of Inisherin is such a great movie in every aspect.

19 March 2023,Confusing and completely foolish.....one of the worst movies I ever watched!!!,"Confusing and completely foolish....one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!!!

The first 15 minutes are interesting, could have been better explored.....when it turns into a ""science fiction "" movie it derails.... The story falls apart....it becomes a sequence of nonsense and lack of continuity.....cannot understand how this B movie became so praised by critics.... Having been awarded the Oscar for Best Movie is hard to understand....in a year that had several really good movies competing ..... Acting as well seems unnatural, forced, grotesque.... This year's Academy winners indicate that Hollywood standards are changing.....for the worse.....

24 January 2023,"Waste of time, messy and not worth one oscar nomination","I am not into hypes, and experienced why while trying to watch this. It is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in ages. It is a plain rip-off of the midnight library with bad acting, thin storyline and a lot of crappy plots.

I lasted 45 minutes but then had to fast forward while it still did not 'grab' me and probably wasn't going to.

I am an honest scifi lover, but this has nothing to do with that. It is simply a collection of stolen ideas, brought together in one -much too long- attempt of a movie.

The fact that this is nominated for 11 oscars, shows what is wrong with that institute.

20 May 2022,Worst multiple universe movie to date.,"I had high hopes for this movie but was ultimately disappointed. I thought i was dissatisfied with the newest matrix until i saw the 1.5 hours of nonsense in this film. The first half hour was decent but then it just became a circus. I guess people laugh at things like a universe full of people with hotdog fingers but I cringed and figured out it's ultimately a kids movie. I would probably even choose some meta/multiple universe B rated movies over this unless i'm trying to keep a child under 5 occupied.

19 March 2023,Best Movie of 2022!!!!,"This movie had its moments. The everything bagel was cute. I suppose it's easy to see how and why the academy would rate it so highly. In my family I was the only one who watched the whole thing. I didn't suggest the movie for family night, but as I kept saying... ""hey, it's the best movie of 2022. There must be a reason the Academy voted for it.""

Yup. There is a reason. The academy did not vote this as best picture because it is a good movie, but rather because of its theme and message.

The movie is nearly unwatchable but if the message resonates with you, perhaps you'll be rewarded with personal gratification.

15 March 2023,Utter drivel!,"I tried to keep an open mind watching this, but kept thinking how in the world did this ridiculous movie get nominated for any kind of award? It was painful to watch and too reminiscent of other slapstick comedy without real humor. Where was the humor? Has our society degenerated so much that this was the best Hollywood had to offer? This one made me wince on the same level as ""Don't Look Up"". Pitiful. Poor Jamie Lee Curtis who finally got an Oscar. She deserves much more for her lifetime of acting in far better roles. I was embarrassed for her and regret that this will be what she will be remembered for.

26 March 2023,i Get it: everything at once and is a BAD movie. √çm HK origin. European Grown. Loved HK movies of the 90s. And I know why Western culture people love it...i hate it,"Spoiler: I have seen 30 min of the film then multiverse jumped the film to the end because it is so BAD and this is my reason: 1.- The film style is a modern version of HK comical films of the 90s, which made Stephen Chow famous and also trying to mix nonsense laught and a touch of ""human wisdom and morality"", this make you feel good...like ""oh...i got it...there is a moral lesson here...others who do not like this film...it is because they are stupid and did not get it, im special"".

2.-I love ""no sense laught films""...but this one..the gags..are copy of older films... like the sausages fingers... 3.-Try to touch lot of sensitive and tender feelings: marriage, gender, family, frustation, hardship of being foreighters, etc etc...this is so ""cheap"" way to gain the audience.

Western people may love this film...because this idea of ""nonsense + morality"" in an asian flavour is new for them...but for me...it is only old ideas, mix it with current moral hot topics, but made in a really un tasty way...

I dont understand how the Oscars gone this way...",2
31 January 2023,Bucking the all or nothing trend,"And saying that this movie is ok. Not great, not terrible. Just ok. Watch half and you have seen the whole. Visually amusing then slightly annoying. Acting great although the squeaky male lead grates after a while and somehow it is difficult to take the 'fat' (using the movie's nomenclature as am sure I would be cancelled if I used it without quotation marks) daughter too seriously. But then not much is too serious about this and that's part of its charm. For my part I felt the message was received way before the finale. To the point where I just willed it to end so I could be done with it and wonder why it was nominated for an Oscar. There are good things for sure but the self indulgence and unnecessary hammering home of the themes just got boring for half of the movie. Shame as the first half was fun.

17 January 2023,what an awful movie,"I watched the movie after it won the best actress Golden Globe.

I had high expectations.

I read so many great reviews, people saying what a great movie this is.

Unfortunately it is only a great mess.

The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is somehow original.

But it was unbearable. Terrible plot,terrible cinematography.

It looked like a fan made movie.

Some scenes were totally awful and hard to watch.

It was quite gory and disgusting.

I could not watch it until the end ,and even if I did, my opinion would not change. No ending can save an unwatchable movie.

I suspect that many people were paid to leave great reviews.

It is trashy.",2
3 February 2023,"Ridiculous, don't waste your time","It does not tick any box. There is no plot, the characters are not developed at all, some of them don't have any real reason to be included in the film, such as the daughter. The camera movement is very bad, as if trying to impress and randomly choose a camera movement from a list. Not art at all. Cinematography is quite ok.it's so sad that these wonderful actors participated in this parody. It's not even a comedy. It must have been a torture for the actors, because the characters were meaningless and aliens. There is no message in this film, and it doesn't entertain you, it's just annoy you. The music........... is completely uninspired. Zero talent. And the editor just took pieces and puts them in irrelevant places and they seem ludicrous. This thing is nominated for Oscars, and has won so many awards? Maybe with some laundering ... it is not a good film .

6 April 2023,Don't believe the hype,"I watched this after reading all the hype, and found it an irritating, confusing and convoluted mess of a film which seems to rely on constant action to keep the viewer's attention. If I had not been watching with friends I would have switched off in the first half hour, but it seems each of us only put up with the full viewing because we thought the others were enjoying it, and afterwards we all agreed it was a complete waste of our evening. Michelle Yeoh put in a sterling performance as Evelyn Wang, but I can find no other reason for the lavish praise that has been heaped upon this film. Don't waste your time with this self indulgent drivel.

18 March 2023,Hot steamin' garbage,"Recieving oscars has lost its meaning as a quality marker. Something is off in the Academy for sure if this pile of junk recieves 7 oscars. Save your money and dont watch this, you'd find more amusement and spare yourself a headache by lighting your money on fire.

I cannot fathom how this is supposed to be peak cinema. It's like we went full circle, and this is the beginning of lap 2. It tries so much, to be so much, but fails miserably at it all.

It's like a bad fusion child of Triangle of sadness, Parasite and Interstellar if you remove all the finesse, charm and well, everything that makes a film good, and then you end up with this hot steaming pile of garbage.

You have been warned!

22 March 2023,"Not my kind of movie, but maybe it's yours?","I didn't particularly enjoy this movie. It was technically well done, well enough acted and so on. But it's a comedy and very silly one at that, and it just got too over the top for my kind of humor.

It has some vague hints to concepts from The Matrix and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, one of my favorite movies of all time and one of my favorite books of all time. But there's nothing profound about this story. It's just stupid in my opinion.

And the movie is too long. The last 30 min I just wanted it to be over.

If this is your kind of movie you'll probably love it. Personally, I just want my two hours back.

14 March 2023,Overrated. People jumping on the bandwagan,"I wonder what people would really say about this film if they were asked without seeing anyone else's ratings or scores? Over hyped and people seemingly just keen to show they 'get it' to look cool. Weak storyline, unnecessary childish gags (something up a rear end, using adult toys as weapons, hotdogs fingers etc.). I like the mutiverse concept, and a story about a mum and daughter, but this was just arty fatty nonsense to me. Makes me wonder if shock and randomness are all you need for an Oscar. I think the people who like this, are the same people who paid $150,000 for those bananas taped to the wall because someone said it was Art.

Everything started out quite well and I was patiently waiting for the jumping to show it's purpose to the plot, so I could ultimately give a damn about what was going on. Sadly this didn't happen.

When the reason was ultimately revealed I was underwhelmed, and checked out.

The ending is sappy nonsense.

It's a mess and I just didn't care what happened to any of the characters.

14 March 2023,Utter rubbish.,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

11 April 2023,Not an oscar worthy movie,"I started watching the movie without any real expectations, although based on the trailer I knew that the plot would be somewhat unconventional.

I made it through the first 30 minutes even though it was not pleasant, as the only thing that was going on was fast paced bickering between the main characters. Afterwards the story ""takes off"" with one bizzare sequence after another, with several failed attempts at humor inbetween. Halfway through the movie I started waiting for the moment which would give sense to everything, however after 2/3 of the movie had passed I lost hope and the moment never came.

The only positive thing is the acting of the lead actress, even though there was nothing intersting and likeable about her character. The humor attempts were juvenile and at the level of stoner comedies but executed at a subpar manner. There were a few intersting lines, thoughts and exchanges between the characters, however FAR FAR from any level of profound depth and thought provoking substance. Would not recommend the movie, let alone give it any awards.",5
22 March 2023,Gobbledegook,"A third rate B Movie, that belongs in an old flea pit ""Art-house"" cinema in the backstreets of a broken down district in town.

A discombobulated mash up of Matrix, The Way of the Dragon/The Karate Kid, Back to the Future (Parts 1-3) and Crossroads.

A script that can only have been written by some 1st grade teenybopper, who's been overloaded with pink ice cream, laced with ketamine.

The director, high on super grade tabs of Acid has force fed the thing through an old Hoover vacuum cleaner pipe and blown it out onto some spare celluloid in his toilet.

Jamie Lee Curtis stated that she couldn't understand the script. Well, quite frankly, no one can.

Actors and acting? In the role that she's been given; Jamie Lee Curtis is like a fish out of water, floundering around trying to make sense of it all on a stage with other actors who are all at sea in this nonsense.

VFX? Looked like they were something pulled out of a recycle bin and pasted in. That was explained, when I read that the VFXers had taught themselves from free online tutorials.

Anything good to say about it? Yes, I had a fabulous Lamb Madras Curry delivered from Kashmiri Spice in Burnage (superb food & recommend to all) before the start of the movie. Full to the gunnels after that, I fell fast asleep in the middle of this empty, noisy embarrassment of a thing for 40mins, saving me from the full 139min exposure. Thank the Lord.

7 x Oscars for this bs .. joke.

Good people; Don't waste139mins of your life watching this twaddle. Thank you.

Wanna see it though? Np .. you'll be able to pick up a copy from the Blu-Ray basement/reject box for 50p/60c .. ¬£1/$1.20 for three in a weeks time.

20 June 2023,Trvialized treatement of multiverse concept,"A real hot mess. This film is an ADHD addled buffet of a bevy of realities none of which make cogent sense.

I am a very seasoned 100% Asian American science fiction buff(2001, Star Wars, The Matrix, Star Trek, Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, Body Snatchers, etc etc) Familiar with many multi verse films/alt reality cyber fiction( Groundhog Day, Butterfly effect, Looper,etc and of course The Matrix) this is a film that trivializes and mocks the concept of what a real multiverse would look and be like. Even the amateurish Butterfly effect at least attempted to handle the consequences of screwing with a multi verse. I'd recommend films like Deja Vu of if you absoleutely needed a comedic take any of the Back to the Future films.

I couldnt buy in on the Asian American laundry trope either sorry is this a ""World of Suzy Wong"" remake in 2023. The short martial arts scenes were OK but mostly this is a waste of Michelle Yeoh's emormous talent. For Asian action flicks any of the Ip Man series would be well worth the time instead of this drivel.",1
10 April 2022,Noisy but dull; a mess,"I concur with the naysayers on this one. It has an unpromising opening, with drab images inside a laundry operated by a Chinese-American woman, who is suffering from relationships with her meek husband, her cranky father, and her annoying daughter who happens to be in a same-sex relationship with a non-ethnic Chinese. You got it. This is a soap opera, but dressed up with a very sloppy sci-fi scenario about time and space travel, alternate universes and such. The main visual inspiration seems to have been ""12 Monkeys"" but that is a much superior film on every level, including the musical score. The musical score here consists of sotto voce pizzicato strings and randomized sounds with emphasized sound-effects. The problem is, whatever music they could have chosen, likely wouldn't have saved this movie. I walked out after 30 minutes. If you read the reviewers who gave this only 1 star, you'll see they are angrier than I am, because they stayed the length, lol. At this moment, the naysayers on this film seem to be a minority, but that is only among the small number of reviewers; the majority when you consider that most of the public, is ignoring the film; and we'll have to see if it even manages to break even. Not that I believe this is the ultimate arbiter of any film; but it is something to keep in mind. (Even if it ends up doing well, I fear it will not be for me. Chacun a son gout!).",3

I don't blame the other nominees for been bitter. The worst nominated actor/actress is far more deserving than any actor/actress in this movie. It's a shame that other movies didn't get the recognition they deserve.

Read it and leave it as one of the things you saw on the internet.

Nothing Nowhere individually

Everything everywhere all at once is not good enough for an Oscar, I think. The movie sums up as a family drama with some essence of the Multiverse of madness and the Matrix.

How odd it is to make a movie about a person who is lost in life and fighting with everyone because they are not able to figure out what they should do, and in the end, they do what everyone is telling that person to do.

ALSO... anyone that thought this ""movie"" was brilliant, great, amazing, etc... SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO REVIEW A MOVIE... EVER.

I watched the movie and about 20 minutes in was already not connecting with any of the characters or the plot/storyline. Wanted to be fair so I continued to watch with an open mind and about an hour and a half in just couldn't take it anymore and shut it off.

I am in my middle years and time is getting more precious...like others stated....felt like this was just a waste of my time.

21 February 2023,it's not a movie it's a movie imitation,"There is intense pollution, and the references to other films are extremely careless, both in terms of color and sound. It was almost like throwing a randomly prepared dish in front of us with a pot.

I perceive this movie as a criticism made to the audience. It is an imitation of a film devoid of aesthetics, devoid of pleasure, full of messages. If there was a rating lower than one star I would give it. Everyone can be sure that even if this movie gets a single Oscar, I will lose my respect for the Oscar.

Here, I also offer my condolences to those who praise the film with such conspicuous effort. It's clear that some of us who don't like it, or you, don't understand the movie.

We all should be grateful for actors like Tom Cruise, making real good movies, no wonder Spillberg told him he saved the movie industry, bringing people back to theaters, the message was clear and still the academy decides to give prizes to this, whatever this is... I guess it is easy to live alienated from what the public really wants to see while the Tom Cruises saves the industry. Btw 600 charactes to be able to publish the review is bs....

You see some similarity with the Matrix, but with too much nonsense and disgusting scenes at which you close your eyes, wish they are over, but when you open your eyes they're still there and then you wish you never have started to watch it.

So, this movie got 7 Oscars, ok actors and actresses performed well on their roles, but what if the story and all the details are childish. Then the acting is just useless right?

I give it a 1 just because you cannot rate it as zero.

When making a movie please consider the people.

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

14 May 2023,Worst movie to win best picture,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen to win best picture. I do think it had an interesting premise, but it was maybe the park poorly executed movie I've seen. The movie could not get out of its own way. Every time there was a dramatic or heartfelt scene it was undercut by something ridiculous or just silly such as the hot dog fingers or the bagel. The movie is well over 2 hours long and I was looking at the clock 10 minutes in. In addition to being ridiculous it was just boring at times and the choreography of most of the fight scenes was pedestrian at best.

It's an embarrassment to the academy that this movie was not only nominated, but it won best picture. The dark knight was not even nominated, they should be ashamed.

22 April 2022,Stupid Waste of Time,"We couldn't wait for the movie then our local theater decided not to show it when it first came out. Then a few weeks later they added it. We were thrilled until we saw it and we both thought it sucked. I rated it 3/10 but should be more like a 2/10. A waste of our time. I really don't know how all of you are giving it a high rating.

14 February 2023,Lame moive with lots of Action and Lots of Asian Actors,"This movie was trying to supposedly make a simple point. It had lots of action that never really related well to carrying the story. It had lots of Asian actors and the only reason I can see it getting 11 Academy Award Nominations was to try to play to equal opportunity after Hollywood's blatant and recent failures.

The cinematography was good and effects good so that can get it several valid nominations (but not likely awards) but it clearly is another over-hyped Hollywood promotion. I would never again come close to this movie even on late night horrible cable and drunk out of my mind. I sat thru it in the theater just to see if anything decent came up and it did not. I will be sure to tell my friends and family.

26 January 2023,Legal weed = love for this movie,"Legalized weed explains the love for this movie. Appreciating someones' creation is helped by getting into the mindset of the creators. MJ helps approximate what the creators were on. So inhale or munch down before watching this hodgepodge film. Otherwise you risk being bored. Shallow storyline and message, lots of filler. Rudimentary cinematography and haphazard continuity. Sound editing was poor, and dialogue was hard to hear, frequently. Maybe by design. The attempts at humor fell flat. A movie like Vengeance is tighter, more profound, funnier, witty even, more ""current"", more relevant and one that will better stand the test of tome - - MJ or no.

3 March 2023,Made me question my love of movies,"Look, there's always some offbeat movie that gets plenty of play around Oscar season. This isn't an offbeat farce. It's a calamity of plagiarism. If you took a bunch of stories from and references to good films and threw them against a wall, you could get this movie. The fights were tired and unimaginative. The dialogue was confusing and disjointed. By the end I was questioning how this was nominated. Is there something about movies I don't get? I thought I liked movies. I'm willing to compensate for the fact that every once in a while there will just be a movie I don't like that will win Best Picture; too artsy, too smart, stuff like that. But this isn't that. It's just bad. And everyone down to the caterer is nominated and I have no idea why.

9 June 2022,What. A. Waste. Of. Time.,"Looking at the other reviews, I have to wonder: did we watch the same movie? Or some people are paid to talk sense in something that has none?

I haven't seen such a bad movie since Predestination. And that was f-ed up pretty nicely, indeed.

I want my time back!

29 March 2023,No Nutrients At All,"Probably this review may contradict the vast majority's but not commenting is simply an insult to my existence.

Whatever good intentions were totally destroyed with how the message was presented... no nutrients at all to foster a healthy mindset - making things way more complicated and more toxic.

Credits though to the actors and crew behind the camera, but unfortunately it was not entertaining at all.

Overly chaotic, over-thinking, unrealistic imagination. Extremely hard to watch till the end - no idea how the movie bagged so many awards. Definitely not a movie I would watch repeatedly... seeing the ending gave me a rejoicefully good riddance.

11 January 2023,What? What was this movie?,"I honestly can't even begin to describe this movie except as a complete mess. I love Michelle Yeoh and she certainly showed her superb acting chops in this movie. I just wish I understood the movie. It is a complete mish-mash of confusion, under the timely guise of the very popular notion of multi-verses. I am a fan of sci-fi, comedy, action, martial arts and acrobatics, bullet-time, slow-mo fight scenes - but geez, all in one scene!? And, what's with the raccoon? A nod to Rocket? I son't know. All I know is that Michelle Yeoh's character comes out of it ok.

Sorry, it's just waaaayyyyy over-rated.

14 March 2023,Not my cup of tea,"I had decided that I should at least try to watch a movie which won the Best picture at the Academy awards. I regret this decision. I had supported The Banshees of Inisherin as I thoroughly enjoyed this quiet, sweet little film. In contrast, Everything was a blur of frenetic activity and pointless action. I turned it off after about 45 minutes. I do not know what sort of political situation inspired the award for this film. I was not invested at all in the lives of the characters. Perhaps I am too old, but I don't believe I would have liked it any more twenty years ago. In my case, a total waste of time!

11 February 2023,overrated,"The movie had an extremely quick pace (hard to follow) and a lot of clich√© meanings.....like we are all insignificant, human relations are the most important part of our lives etc.

There were moments that the movie was actually amusing but in general it makes you feel like you want to stop watching it and see something else. The triangle of sadness is actually a better movie or even The Banshees of Inisherin, but nowadays if something differentiate from other movies we immediately embrace it like a masterpiece. Although it will win a bunch of Oscars, actually is like a home movie, the one that you will see while eating your lunch.

10 March 2023,Doesn't make any sense! Extremely confuse...,"I wonder if the writers were under cocaine or if they smoke their carpet while writing this... This movie doesn't make any sense, we see things happening, while we can enjoy some fat humor and the acting of Michelle Yeoh, this is 2h of ""WTF is going on here?"". People are shooting and fighting everyone without really understanding what is going on. They die and then they're back alive, even if they switch bodies and so on, you must at least have some consistency with that, which this movie doesn't have. We see images follow one another without any sense. I lost 2h watching this stupidity. Was all the movie a dream? The ending seems to erase everything that happened... Maybe we could consider this as such. I don't recommend this, and don't understand all the praise for it.

18 June 2023,Disappointing movie,"When I saw the movie poster I thought (like everyone) 'ah yes the Oscar one, great!'. At that point my excitement level was 100% and 15 minutes in the movie it started to decrease steadily to reach pure boredom around 15 minutes before the end. On one hand it has some interesting-ish characters, a story that could have really captured people imagination, and some well edited sequences. On the other hand it is without a question too long (I do like long movie but this one is just repetitive. Very repetitive. Extremely repetitive). To make things worst, it tries too hard to be clever (you know like when a teenager discovers irony). After a while it just becomes oh so predictable and, frankly, a bit painful to finish. Overall I have liked some bits of it and there was clearly a good performance from the actors so I don't think is it fair to call it complete rubbish. However, be warned, unless you are 15, you're not going to find it stellar either.

24 June 2022,Definitely does not deserve the hype but its Okay to watch.,"I am guessing most reviews must be biased in one way or the other. It s not that great but its ""okay"" as a weekend entertainment with the family , kind of thing. I wouldn't go to a cinema to watch it but I would watch it if it was on TV .

Maybe its because after all the positive criticism I was expecting too much so it was a kind of disappointment . However 4/10 points is still being generous about it. Its not that great , just barely good enough to watch it.

26 February 2023,Worst movie of my entire life,"I don't get it, for me this movie is proof that society have just gone crazy. No way this is a 8 star movie, every second was torture for me.

It seems like the director is throwing every single idea into the movie in an outrageous and not funny way. It tries to send a strong message through a bad executed and shallow movie. There's so much information, this movie is a Frankeinstein, just a lot of crazy cuts compiled together, is simply stupid, bad and ridiculous. Honestly I'd rather eat trash every single day of my life rather than watching it again. And the worst part is that it's probably going to win the Oscar for best picture. I'm too old for this, please give it one star.

17 March 2023,A monument to trash masquerading as art,"If you thought this might be good (or even watchable), check out The Heroic Trio with Michelle Yeoh back when she was Michelle Kahn as Invisible Woman! It's quirky fantasy nonsense as well, but it's good. Less fantastic but especially recommended are Dynamite Fighters (aka Magnificent Warriors) and Royal Warriors (aka In the Line of Duty). She plays female versions of Indiana Jones and Dirty Harry, respectively.

These films are all Hong Kong releases with original language in Cantonese. English subtitles and/or English dubs available.

It's great that she received an Oscar, but search out one or more of her early classics.

25 March 2023,Like the old Batman series,"Boom, Splash, Bang, Poff, Sapp, Shing, but without the fun graphics and instead trick-shot ""for real"". It goes on for for 90(??) neverending minutes, instead of the 10 seconds in Batman and it is all about jumping/fighting scenes. And without any real story behind it.

Sure, they jump between ""worlds"" like the dreams of Inception, and it is probably technically well executed. But it never ends...

This could be the worst movie I have seen. I fell asleep after 30 minutes of Boom, Splash etc, of pure boredom. I woke up 30 min later and understood the story as easy as jumping into any of the Love Boat episodes. I really cannot understand how this movie has gained so much appreciation.

15 April 2022,Felt like an Edgar Wright movie,"I enjoyed this movie but there were definitely a lot of moments I felt a little embarriced to be there. The movie itself wasn't anything I've never seen before going off the plotline trend of movies like the matrix, Lego movie, free guy (ordinary person becomes hero and unlocks and learns their full potential through trial and error). The quirkiness and craziness is definitely it's selling point which makes it unique in its own way but gets cringey as it tries to hold its momentum and maintain the chaoticness for the grandiose finale. Felt very Scott pilgrim-ey, Edgar Wright would have loved to make this movie, I also thought the whole multiverse thing was really pushed in the wake of this new marvel narrativev and the Anthony/Joe Russo producer credits make that a little suspect. Overall decent but a little cringe, nice moral of the story (we need more positive messages in films)

17 March 2023,Huge letdown,"There's something rotten in Denmark for this movie to be anywhere near awards other than a dozen Razzies. Oscars? Top Gun with The Fabelmans a close second.

Almost as rotten as American Beauty over Sixth Sense, Green Mile, and Cider House.

Six hundred...ok

Let me have your attention for a moment. So you're talking about what? You're talking about that sale you shot, some son of a gun that doesn't want to buy, somebody that doesn't want what you're selling, some broad you're trying to bed and so forth. Let's talk about something important. Are they all here? ... Well, I'm going anyway. Let's talk about something important. Put that coffee down. Coffee's for closers only.

20 February 2023,Stupidest movie I've ever seen,"Don't waste your time. This movie is nonsensical rubbish. A complete onslaught of ridiculous images that just left us shaking our heads. Certain parts left me questioning why and how they could've been allowed or even entertained to be included. Parts that were meant to be funny were cringeworthy. Parts that were meant to be touching or wise were an ill attempt to add some kind of meaning to the film. I was so disappointed with this movie. It had me saying ""what the f%#* was that?"" too many times. Seriously such a poorly executed film. I guess the only good thing I can say is that we kept watching until the end.

24 April 2022,Most unintentionally cringey movie I've seen,"Pros:
The filming for some parts was very good. Most of the movie was visually pleasing.


The idea of doing something out of place to jump between these paralell universes was quite original.


Cons:
The world was both overexplained, and not explained enough. It seems like they haven't really developed how the world works, so they just threw in some scientific sounding mumbo-jumbo.",1
14 March 2023,Overrated,"Unbelievable that this movie could get an Oscar. I usually never comment here, but this time it was needed for everyone's sake. Seeing that it has around eight in average rating is not fair to all the users who are tricked into thinking that the movie is really good and pay money to see it. I may have missed something genius, but the fact that it received Oscars and high ratings is a sign of some kind of herd mentality and good marketing by the studio.

At the end of the day, shouldn't the Oscars go to something the majority of the population likes? In this case, it seems to be extremely polarized, either the film gets a 9-10 or a 1-3.

If you think kindness and acceptance is an issue in this world it is time to stop watching movies like this and get off social and mainstream media. Whatever your belief system is kindness and acceptance is a given don't believe anything else. If you are confused by this then i suggest you learn about the Abrahamic faiths and realise where humans came from and what their purpose is.

Other then that this movie is okay for entertainment purposes.

But come on, the story here is so underwhelming. Mostly just action scenes and cool FX. I was very bored and felt no emotional connection whatsoever. The acting is phenomenal although.

If you're expecting some sort of breakthrough you're not going to get it. The trailer says enough: the universe is a big place so nothing matters. Just do you.

Many things are straight out silly, especially the ""landing pads"", some supposedly funny activities that people have to perform in order to jump to another universe and gain some special skill.

28 September 2023,Great pictures and colors but overrated? Ye,"The story, sci-fi, and scripts were just terrible to be honest. The usage of colors and emphasis of a ""great motion picture"" was executed superbly. I think this film was definitely overrated and the use of Chinese actors kind of made it a bit worse (but it opened a door for Chinese viewers which created more of an audience).

I felt as if the cast were American mixed with Chinese or Indian it would've been a lot more different and done more beautifully.

The comedic approach to the film was good and some were fresh. But some of the attempts were very cringe worthy and would've actually been funny if they were done by actual comedic actors or someone who weren't Asian...

I tried to watch this for 20 minutes and I realize this is stupid and full of nonsense, I didnt even think that I dont get it. It is nothing to get about it. Its a mess and a bad and unfortunate combination between Matrix and Inception. After watching for more than 20 years classic movies, mostly European but also American, watching this movie made me realize that the Oscars will not have any viewers in the next 5 years. I know this is a huge business and they should get on truck soon. Feeling sprry for them. Life is short so go and see something else.

I understand that the concept itself was interesting and there was even some funny parts - but overall it was confusing , dirty , stupid and just not good . I was intrigued the first 35 min but after that really forced myself through to the end . There was nothing cinematography pleasing about it.

A lot of better movies to watch - my advice is pick something else.

7 April 2022,Tragically overrated and depressing,"If you've ever force-fed peanut-butter sandwiches on a group of strangers, you'll recognize that most of the group will consume it as a hearty snack, while a small percentage of them will literally die. The absurdity of that hypothetical scenario is exactly the problem with Everything Everywhere All at Once. Of about 25 people in the audience, 4 left partway through, and after the movie 2 were seen in a comatose state of tears and deeply in need to be held while the rest of the audience was busy repeating the mantra that it was the best movie they had ever seen (in stark contrast). The ubiquitous positive reception by the majority only adds insult to injury.

This comedy is a story of nihilism and the mundane constancy of 'laundry and taxes' (aka death and taxes). In the story, a mother who owns a 'laundromat', which serves as a symbolic place for hundreds of 'machines' or 'multiverses' to cycle constantly in a pointless cycle of life and death, is audited at multiple levels for her worthiness to rescue her daughter (and as a consequence the multiverse). It meticulously and powerfully makes a concerted effort to reconstruct the mind of a victim of depression inside the minds of the viewers. It intentionally overwhelms the senses and adds increasing doses of chaos until a conglomerate of elated misery and confusion is fully formed in the mind of the viewer, much like in the mental state of a person who suffers from depressive trauma. It then makes a feeble attempt at dissolving this toxic construct with a caustic fallacy that long term depression can be solved with love. It invites those who have truly felt depression to reawaken any past horrors and then face them with no warning or preparation, and to be left with an aftermath of feeling worthless whilst asking them to contemplate suicide. All within a guise of fast-paced hilarious scenes that make it highly appealing, much like rat poison covered in frosting.

Most unfortunately, the comedy is well constructed and the narrative is cohesive, which makes it quite a powerful and well-made story. However, with great power comes great responsibility, something which is tragically ignored. The writers welcome us to contemplate the meaninglessness of life in this free ride to hell. Any who have inner demons will be snatched out of there seats and into an introspective trial with their worst horrors. All else will be able to pass this off as a light-hearted comedy with mediocre story. This is why food with peanuts comes with allergy warnings.",2
17 April 2023,I honestly just need to sit down after that.,"Like watching a Wes Anderson backwards. Reading William Falkner upside down. A circus performance, on roller skates, during a light show, on a tab of acid... and you have epilepsy.

All the impact, none of the effect.

Perhaps I am one who does not take kindly to exorbitant, grandiose displays of trigger-happy cinematography and CGI, finding beauty more in subtlety and nuance - but I'd imagine the Daniels, in crafting their art, make no attempt at such frivolity.

(I would, however, find great entertainment in how Mr. Kwan, and Mr. Scheinert explained the conception of such a film to investors, without the presence of psychedelics.) 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' - a mouthful true to the visual storm, explosion of colour, and stark novelty that it captured. The frantic attempts to squeeze as many effects possible into the given time frame, rendered it - less a movie with a coherent storyline; and more a 2hr compilation of chaotic energy drink ads. The question is: would it have received such acclaim, if without such an exorbitant visual effects budget? Visual effects that left my head sore like it had just been punched square between my eyebrows.

However, Mr. Kwan, and Mr. Scheinert painted in a new colour (supposedly a shade of green that washed the audience's faces at the Oscars) and I will award praise to anything that stretches the lines of convention.",4
18 May 2022,Meaningless and silly,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

14 March 2023,Am I watching a different film?,"In what universe does this film win all these awards? Yes it's unique I'll give it that. But being unique and weird doesn't make it a great movie. Utter nonsense such as sausage fingers, black hole or center of the universe bagel, giant profound rocks, dildo fight, and jumping on a giant butt plug to increase your superpowers. Apparently switching between a fight scene and two pinatas is profound and artistic. Who cares if there is a deeply profound message buried inside this crap sandwich this movie makes wish I'd read more books. This movie is correct, there is always something to love. I'd love to get my money back and forget I wasted two hours on this mess.

13 February 2023,Abominable. A disgrace to the word Movie,"I've literally never written a review and I probably don't even have the right skills to do it but this one has disgusted me in such a way that I feel the urge to write this or else I go completely crazy.

Does no one see this has the full recipe for commercial success in 2023 ? Take Jamie Lee Curtis and you have the ""big name"". It doesn't matter if her role is irrelevant and brings a huge embarrassment to her entire career. The rest of the actors might as well have 0 acting skills. Add some fancy expensive CGI's that almost require an epilepsy warning. Take a script writer, hit his head on the keyboard until making him unconscious and voil√†, your success is granted.

I've always followed this golden rule of not making comments about movies unless I watch them until the end. After this one I really need to reconsider this self torturing principle because I honestly felt body pains while waiting for it to end. Just thinking that this stands a real chance to win the Oscar makes me want to projectile vomit until dehydrating to death.

The only good part is that I now know not ever to trust the ratings on IMDB because people only want to act cool by liking nonsense, timewasting disasters. This trend needs to stop although I feel it's only going to get worse like everything else on this planet.",1
18 March 2023,More Pseudo-intellectual Hype Train Drivel,"People who plotz over this movie as if its the best thing ever, are, I think, just obsessed with wanting to impress the neighbors, to join the hype train and pretend they're smarter than everyone else. There are a few profound moments in this movie, very few, certainly not enough to justify sitting in a theater for over 2 hours of excruciating boredom. This movie lost my attention within the first 30 minutes. I'm sure the hot-dog fingers were an attempted metaphor at something profound. I'm sure the giant bagel was, too, but all the pointless, plot-less, frenetic action just made it all unwatchable. I don't need happy endings, simple plots or pretty people to enjoy a movie. I like a thought-provoking film as much as the next free-thinking person, but this film, and its success, are nothing more than hype-train drivel lead by well-meaning low-vibe sycophants.

11 February 2023,Exhausting and overrated,"This movie was too much information, too much noise, too much mess. I didn't feel anything: I didn't get emotional, didn't laugh and I got bored. My ears and my mind were already exhausted and bored by minute 45. This is one of the very few times I've hated a movie that is so well rated everywhere. Why did it get so far? I just DON'T GET IT. This is my first review on IMDb and I just wanted to do it because I was so pissed off at this movie.

The only reason why I don't rate it with 1 is because I did laughed/smiled a couple of times with some dark humor (which I'm very fond of, but which in my opinion was not enough to save the movie), and because the scene with the stones was worth something.

19 March 2023,....,"Way over the top for a movie with such a basic premise. Very basic life lesson for kids, be kind to others. Kindness doesn't equal weakness yadayada. Oh and misunderstood kid with a traditional asian parents. What else is new. Feels like watching a kids movie with such immature and unintelligent humour, over the top plot guzzler of a character and such basic premise. The only good part about this movie is the action coreography, otherwise theres nothing else to see. Snoozefest, even my friends fell asleep not even midway through, I was barely holding on just to see what the movie is about. Safe to say I should have taken a nap as well.

3 April 2022,Avoid this nonsense,"This is one of the worst movies I have watched and I sat through ""Doolittle"".

I got a free advance screening to this and I still feel like I've been robbed.

Honestly just avoid at all cost, during the screening we watched 4 people walk out and my only regret is not following them.

10 September 2023,Maybe too original,"The basic premise as described is great, and the technical execution was top-notch, and rightfully acknowledged by the Oscars, but:

Fast-paced, and sometimes chaotic conversations are an acquired taste, and sometimes tiring to keep up with.

Couple that with aesthetic choices that can make Legion seem tame, to the point of occasionally becoming gross,and some will be hard-pressed to find a reason to keep watching.

In short, the Oscars have done it again: This movie, like 'The Revenant', before it has a lot to offer to those interested in technical aspects of film making, or just keen to see something completely different, but difficult to enjoy for those looking for casual entertainment.",5
11 October 2022,Love it or hate it,"One thing for sure, it is very accurately named indeed, but Everything Everything All at Once amounted to not much as far as I am concerned.

It's definitely a ""love it or hate it"" flick, unfortunately I leaned on the latter and couldn't keep watching beyond the first hour. The progression of the story is just too erratic and the pace too exhausting without much to keep my curiosity entertained. The quirkiness didn't grow on me at all, the humour fell flat at my feet and everything (all at once) felt rather forced.

If I were generous I'd say it's a movie that wasn't made for my generation, but since I'm snobbish I'll rather assume that 15 years of formulaic Marvel franchises have severely lowered viewers' standards for this movie to receive such rave reviews.

13 March 2023,Just Couldn't,"No... No... NO. I tried to watch it. I just couldn't sit through it. Absolutely nothing in this movie made sense. It's not pretty. The music is not good. The acting is ridiculous. Once upon a time I worked in mental health and my most messed up patients made more sense. The language didn't even make sense jumping around from English to Chinese and back willy nilly. I have absolutely loved Michelle Yoeh in martial art films but she is totally wasted in this one. This is a bad dream that is designed to give your bad dreams bad dreams. I only paid $2 to rent it from the Redbox and I want my money back. It is absolutely unbelievable that this is what someone considers Oscar worthy. Tar, the Fableman, Women Talking, and Woman King are Oscar worthy. I am sorry but this is not it.

14 March 2023,What did I just watch?,"Was this movie produced by the local psychiatric hospital? I simply cannot understand the hype. It seems weirdness is currently glorified and seems to be the norm. I miss the old good movies with engaging, reasonable scripts. I still cannot believe films such as Elvis , Avatar, Top Gun were clouded by this waste of celuloid. Perhaps, the most notable aspect of this film was the incredible change of sets and unforseen twists which came rushing through like a delusional, schizophrenic chronic episode. At some scenes it almost felt as if you were experiencing some kind of epileptic seizure. Weirness at its best!

26 March 2023,Way too overrated mess,"Are people still laughing at a century old sexual jokes? This mess is a too long, gibberish-filled trash, nothing more. You can see the actors are trying way too hard to act naturally, which makes it even harder to watch. The plot? It's all over the place. The film is trying to be confusing and fails miserably. I see some people are comparing this trash to the Matrix and Tenet. Just, please.

The idea overall is actually intriguing yet the execution is an almost 3 hour long, unbearable mess. If want to give it a shot expecting a Nolan style multi universe masterpiece, do not even dare. Nothing but mess, all over the place.

20 May 2022,What a failure,"For entertainment, this one is totally wasting time. Poor structure. Hopeless storyline. It doesnt draw any attention but confusing constantly change screens. How could they expect any entertainment there.

They are Chinese, obviously. The mixed with Chinese-English lines with Malaysia-English accent plus Mandarin and Cantonese together. Even a Chinese wouldnt understand this mixture.

The actors and actresses are good as expected. Probably they would be much more presenting in anything else but this movie.

30 July 2022,Are people being sarcastic with their reviews?,"I'm really confused about all the high ratings for this film, I'm trying to understand why people think this was any good after the first 20 minutes or so. Was I supposed to get high on acid to go see it? Because I felt like I was being punked by Hollywood or something. Did Covid lower our expectations or messed up our brains that we consider this great cinema or are people trying to sound like they got a message that no one else got? I really wanted to like this film but I didn't, so I guess I'm not special but I'm okay with that.

1 June 2022,Trash,"I'm starting to think that somehow people fake ratings, there is no way this movie is anywhere close to 8, I give it 5 stars only cuz I stopped watching it half way with my girl cuz we got bored, I don't know who finds this movie good. It's just bad, we started watching with high hopes cuz of rating, but we couldn't watch past half. Lately Asian movies are really good, specially South Korean, but this was just a mess. We love to watch deep movies, movies with strong story, character development, good conversations, this one was just cheap stupid and not funny movie! Hell, I would probably enjoy watching kids Marvel movies than this.

It feel like a B movie and worst, stupid plot, terrible actors with party toys and dollars costumes. How many critics has been bribe by his ferrerie boyfriend. Don't even go to the cinema, I've lost money for a movie. Just one star for the Kung Fu, but even the stunts was terrible. How it could be funny a dildo fitting. Just again, I've feel robe from the academy and follow your instincts and don't listen anything you see. Surprising, Doctor Strange and Muitiverse was for superior, not the best but at least it was less none less.

17 March 2023,Disappointing. Too Heavy on the Sci Fi front.,"Swooping 7 Academy Awards in an array of cinematic fields. Everything Everywhere All at Once is an explosive package, a fast-paced spectacle designed for the most avid sci-fi fans.

A Chinese immigrant gets unwillingly embroiled in an epic adventure where she must connect different versions of herself in the parallel universe to stop someone who intends to harm the multiverse.

Personally, the multiverse is not a favoured setting for myself, neither is an overload of breaking the extents of human capabilities. Therefore, I had low expectations for a film with such high acclaim.

Undoubtedly, the cinematic features are like we've never seen before. Flawless. Sensational. The directory work of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert in manipulating the camera giving it a supernatural edge even in scenes of simplicity. The sound and effects are timed appropriately, leaving a lasting memory of every scene and stamping contributing to the fast-pace adventure of the watch.

The clever use of comedy contrasting with scenes of distress is measured perfectly. Main character Evelyn goes on an emotional journey in contrasting what her life could've been, to the life she lives today. The humour value provided by her husband and the exceptional supporting role Jamie Lee Curtis' character gives us, is the perfect tonic to the suffering the protagonist experiences.

Equally, scenes of combat / conflict are able to contrast with scenes of stillness, a loud vs quiet comparison acts as a resemblance of reality vs fantasy.

The on-screen acting performances are a joy to behold. Three Oscars deservingly going to Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis respectively, as they all immerse themselves into this sci-fi, action world created. Understanding their roles and ensuring the film keeps its serious, yet authentic feel - doing the sublime screenplay justice.

Certainly a cinematic experience worth living. Though, as anticipated, the film leans too heavy on the side of sci-fi and fantasy, escaping reality entirely. It wasn't for me, but it is for many. Give it a go.",5
18 May 2022,MAN THIS SUCKED,"I will proceed by saying the actors were phenomenal especially Yeoh and Quan, however the actual story was booty. Honestly, I did not see the hype or creativity behind this movie. It was fake creative and a fake original that is geared towards the type of youth who think they're edgy and cool saying nothing matters we are pointless small specks in the universe. That trope is old and overused. & rlly, this movie is as deep as elmo's voice.

I walked into this film purely because of the high ratings and had no expectations. It was not it. If you think randomness equates to funny and liked Pulp Fiction then maybe you'll like this film. As for the plot, this felt like the adult and more chaotic version of ""Turning Red,"" it's the same general message about the mother daughter relationship. But just overly chaotic and definitely and made me not see the value of this movie.

26 March 2023,not what i expected,"When i think of classic movies i think of the dark knight, shawshank redemption and return of the king not just because they did well at the oscars (shawshank redemption did not win one) but because they were good movies. The fact that every thing every where all at once has won not one oscar but seven is borderline robbery for other movies like elvis and batman mainly because it does not deserve half of the oscars it won.

I'm not saying it is a bad movie i am saying it is alright just highly overrated. I would have been happy with the movie if it had no unnecessary hype around it and i could just watch it but no, for some reason half of the planet thinks this is one of the greatest movies ever. Also just the fact that every thing every where all at once got nominated for 11 is just a disgrace in it self in short they are saying this movies is better that movies like the shawshank redemption, inception, the departed and 12 angry men and many other movies.

In short watch the movie but don't be swayed by a plethora of overrated reviews because you will only find yourself more disappointed and asking more questions on how this won 7 oscars.

10 July 2022,This is rated an 8.2 out of 10?,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

2 August 2022,A Waste of My Life,"2hrs36mins in the cinema, wasting my life at a film I can say is the only one that did less for me than Tenet. I didn't follow it, stopped wanting to and kept nodding off. This was the 're-released' version which basically had the additions of the Daniels' introduction where they came across as two spoiled students trying to be funny and 8 minutes of very boring and unfunny outtakes following the credits. It seems like these are two trusted filmmakers who have had money thrown at them and been allowed to indulge some drunken student fantasies. Definitely not for me.

15 April 2023,I don't get this movie!,"This movie is boring! I love science fiction, I love martial arts, love action, love comedies. I don't get this movie. It is a ridiculous plot. It's not funny. The action sequences and special effects are not good. The plot really is silly. Not entertaining at all.

I'm happy to fill the rest of this review just to get the correct number of characters but my first paragraph says it all. I'm not criticizing the acting. I think the creator of this movie had no idea what he was doing. Jumping around from one reality to another is perfectly fine if you except that idea as a science fiction, but mixing these unknowing characters into that complex plot is just silly. Not funny not interesting. Some random person coming in to see their accountant and getting sucked into another reality. Great, that is so exciting.....

26 July 2022,Mediocre nothing else!,"Very interesting concept, very well presented, this is something new I must admit. Some kind of psychedelic-bloody-slightly perverse atmosphere works here with some kind of forced and partial perverted comedy that is not funny at all. There is some action throughout the film, if we can call it action at all, the description says it's an adventure, but I didn't see any trace of adventure here. It's immediately obvious that this definitely is not for everyone taste. I'm bothered by the bilingualism that drags through the film, it's somehow disorienting and uninteresting. The actors did their job properly, the only thing I don't like is the portrayal and characteristics of the character played by Stephamie Shu, that role sets the film back quite a bit and makes it uninteresting in parts and boring. All in all, I partly see why the rating of the film is so high, but I think that the rating is definitely not fully justified, this is a mediocre time killer with some boring and uninteresting scenes and nothing more.

1 March 2023,WHERE TO STARTüò±?!?!?!,"It struck me half way through this film that the whole viewing experience would have been greatly enhanced if you were on mind altering drugs üòÇ.

From a benign somewhat average start the film quickly descends into a cheap amalgamation of eclectic film genre. Cliche after clich√© attempt to sew together sometimes incomprehensible material. Explanations were faulty and hurried leaving you guessing and missing the next hurried onslaught.

It was, I can only explain as a poor attempt at combining a Monty Python film with a sub standard Matrix offering that then gave birth to Rom Com offspring.

Ultimately empty and meaningless which I believe was the point of the film. Hey maybe that was the intention behind this mess of a movie ??

Milking the meme culture of our age that makes anything meme-able or gif-able automatically successful.

It is just an opinion but I don't believe that being absurd makes you funny, or that hot-dog hands and butt plugs are original and clever sources of humour.

The only thing that it got accurately was how noisy the mother - daughter relationship is and how most of the time it doesn't make sense. But, again, a Disney film can do that too, it's nothing groundbreaking and definitely cannot ""save"" the rest of the film.

22 September 2022,I hope I never see another movie as bad as this,"I agree with all the other 1 ratings. (Wish I could have rated it a 0!)

This movie had no redeeming value. And, the only reason I sat through the whole, excruciating, 2 hours and 12 minutes of it was because I thought my friend wanted to. (Turned out she thought as little of it as I did.)

How anyone in their right mind could find anything interesting about this film is beyond me.

I'm no aficionado of martial arts, but even that didn't seem well done, to me. Years ago, I saw several Jackie Chan movies, but, as I recall, the martial arts scenes were captivating; the ones in this movie just seemed like senseless violence.

26 September 2022,"Pretentious and averrated, pure hype.","Prologue or important clarification: I don't recall ever giving a star on any review. Please don't think this is hate or something. I don't know the actors or the directors, there is nothing personal. I even had high hopes for the movie as it was highly recommended to me, but I don't see how this movie can have more than one star.

Also, maybe some will want to call me a boomer or something. To them I would clarify that I have seen quite absurd movies before. From the top of my head I can think of: Pink Flamingos, Begotten, Nirvana, Crash, A Serbian Film, Ebola Syndrome, Even Dwarfs Started Small, Mermaid in a Manhole, Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky, Nekromantik, Schramm, La Matanza Cannibal de los Garrulos Lisergicos... Okay, I don't find them good, but I think they are better than a star, well, maybe not the last one...

Going back to the movie in question, some say it is deep and meaningful, but there is certainly nothing deep in the pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-scientific plot. There is not the slightest hint of a new idea or a new perspective, never mind a good exposition of what it purports to be.

The argument is tedious, absurd, illogical and also predictable. The way the creators of this movie want to avoid the above is by introducing absurd elements that want to distract you from the childish plot. The film ends with the classic Hollywood clich√© where love finally triumphs.

If you want an original movie, you won't find it at Everything Everywhere All at Once. If you want a pretentious, nonsensical plot that aspires to be edgy or deep, you might be in the right place. This movie is completely forgettable and I'm sure no one will talk about it in the future. It's just a gimmick that will pass with the tide.

The only reasons I could give another star is the original music and the acting. The acting is heroic considering how bad the movie is. It's fascinating how well the actors managed to do ther job, so kudos to them. Maybe I could give it another star, but the movie is too bad for the reasons stated.

Anyway, I find it fascinating to read the comments, especially those who say that it is one of the best movies ever and that it is in their top 3 or 5 of favorites. I bet they'll almost forget about this, their 'favorite' movie in a couple of years.",1
6 March 2023,Not Everything It's Cracked Up To Be,"Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis star, and provide their typical solid perfomances in this (soft-)sci-fi/fantasy about a family which becomes enmeshed in a conflict spanning a multiverse, where all possible outcomes of their past choices and actions exist simultaneously. Against this backdrop, the film explores issues of communication, understanding, and acceptance within family and society.

While admittedly ambitious in scope, this effort quickly devolves into a frenzied, farcical, sometimes ludicrous, acid trip of disjointed ideas and imagery, and plays like an exhausting looney-toon mashup of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Mask"".

Is it creative and original? Certainly. However, these alone don't make a film enjoyable or praiseworthy, and this hodgepodge quilt of interesting ideas, pieced together with duct tape and bubble gum, ultimately falls short of anything which can be called ""good"". Hardcore cinemaphiles may enjoy the experimental storytelling, but I expect most others will likely be disappointed, and perhaps even disturbed.

Due to mostly solid acting, originality, and a few laughs, I'll give this 3 stars, despite its otherwise near unwatchability.",3
9 June 2023,Worst Movie. Don't waste your precious time.,"The directors' experience before making this drivel was a DN Snake video an SD c g get s movie 'Swiss Army Man'. That's all you need to know.

That this and 'Oscar' are even mentioned in the same sentence tells you how broken the nominating process is.

I don't really know who's ramming this movie down everyone's throats, but I've seen more plausible plots in old Troma movies. Here, the creators just throw everything at the screen, hoping something will stick. They figure if the plot/location/time/scene changes often enough, then people will be too busy trying to make sense of it all instead of realizing they're being duped.

Possibly the stupidest movie I've seen in 2-3 decades.

22 February 2023,Don't bother,"I watched about half this movie before I gave up. It's garbage. It's stupid. It's so American stupid, it screams American stupidity at every corner. I don't know where to start. The constant switching between Mandarin and Cantonese is so confusing to people who understand one but not the other language, like myself. The story makes absolutely no sense at all. It's a collection of offensive scenes designed to shock and confuse the simple minded; it's amateurish nonsense at the worst high school level you can think of. It's shameful to subject anyone to watch this nonsense. It has no bearing on anything that matters, it's a waste of time and a waste of money. And, I am fluent in Chinese so I can only say that I thought the Mandarin dialogues were understandable but did not add anything to the story. This is not about Asian American anything. It's dumb.

12 June 2022,Overrated But Not Awful,"I love anything with the multiverse but this movie was too hard to follow. For me it's just too much action and needed more character development. At the same time, it's very creative and different. Loved the hotdog fingers and butt plug awards. I can see why people either love it or hate it though. I can see this becoming a cult classic down the road.

21 January 2023,No substance,"This is a movie that has had the most accurate review written hundreds of years ago by Shakespeare.

""It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."" This movie was all sound and fury without any substance. All of the attempted emotional scenes fell flat and don't connect. It seemed like the writers just threw a bunch of disparate movie ideas at a wall and where they stuck was how it was in the movie. Very visual stylish and meaning nothing.

The action scenes were well don but just got stupid and silly almost immediately for no reason. The whole movie was just unconnected randomness with only the most tenuous of connections. It does not hold my attention or interest.

I'm a fan of hard sci-fi and martial arts movies and this just missed the mark in everything it tried. The writing seemed like it was written by a stupid person trying to be a smart person. It's transparent in it's ridiculous attempt to be clever and falls on it's face.

The acting was very good given the limited nature of the story they were given and can't be faulted for a failed story.

This film didn't connect with me on any level and I won't be recommending it to anyone.",2
19 March 2023,A Total Disappointment!!,"""Everything Everywhere, All At Once"" is a film that is practically unwatchable. Despite its good costume design and individual scenes, the movie is disjointed, overly long, and ultimately a waste of time. I would rate this film a 1 out of 10.

The plot of the movie is convoluted and difficult to follow, with too many storylines and characters to keep track of. The film's attempts at humor and action fall flat, and the overall tone is confusing and inconsistent.

The only redeeming quality of the film is its impressive costume design and some visually striking scenes. However, these brief moments of enjoyment are not enough to make up for the film's many flaws.

20 August 2022,What the?,"Ok I'm still trying to work out if it's the antibiotics and night nurse I'm tripping with or if that film is just insane. Egotistical rubbish that is trying to be 'different'. Much better films out there that do it so much more creatively. Didn't realise until I read a review after and it's by the same people who did the Swiss Army Man film with Daniel Radcliffe. That was tripe too.

1 star for costume and make up 1 star for the chap from the Goonies

Watch it but be warned you will not get 2 plus hours back of your life.

13 March 2023,Dissapointed,"So I Saw it won Oscar's, so I had to see it. I have never seen a movie so bad win an Oscar. Bad acting, utterly ridiculous confusing story.

I don't understand how this can even get nominated when you see the other winners. This is is really a step back in moviemaking. Sad to say.

I have tried to keep an open mind and believe in movies trying to create new ways of moviemaking, but where is the good character acting here?

The story is lacking a clear red line and meaning. What exactly is it trying to tell us? It's like a mixture of bad kung fu movies from 80's and matrix but lacking originality. Sorry but as a movie lover I appreciate the many fantastic movies there are out there, but this one is not among them.

20 June 2022,Wacky,"The three stars are for imaginative. But I think at some point the creators of this film couldn't tell the difference between good creative ideas and bad ones. To me it was a mess, it was throwing everything onto a canvas, paint, feces, glitter, ground beef, spit, glue, and melted crayons, then smearing it around and hoping the audience decides to make more of it than it really is. Yes, the movie has a message. And it's a good message. But how a message is delivered matters, and this one was delivered through an unpleasant, loony movie.

19 January 2023,Raunch and bizarre humour,"Telling a coherent story and building emotional connections with the audience are at the bottom of the list for this twisted raunchy trek through what is essentially one long stylized action scene. Combining themes from horror genres and low-brow humour, this is one film that attempts to mash a Christmas carol with nihilism and sex toys.

The writing is deliberately bizarre, with a story that is too convoluted for most, but don't mistake this for a deep philosophical film, nay, to the contrary, it has a social agenda (It's hard to find a film that doesn't these days). If you find plot devices like people having to do statistically improbable things like inserting a butt plug in the middle of a fight scene, or beating someone with a pair of oversized artificial genitalia funny, then by all means you may find this entertaining. If however you find such things deeply offensive, or pretentious, then this is one film probably left alone.

16 January 2023,Stupidity hid its true beauty,"My friends were raving about this movie (RAVING!) and I hate to say I was sadly disappointed. I really loved the idea of it, though, and the message it was trying to send. But the story line was so difficult to follow, it led me into instant confusion. My biggest issue with this movie was that it could have done without the ridiculous fighting scenes and universes (a universe where humans have hot dog fingers? And they eat their fingers with mustard coming out?). These details distracted me from the true message behind this film. It could have been so much more, way more poignant, without the overload of stupidity. This inundation kept it from being the true gem it could have been.

13 March 2023,Maybe the 6th or 7th Best Movie,"This movie was not even close to the best picture. Several of the nominees were better films. This year turned out to be Asian recognition day. Let's hope next year the Academy can pick the best picture without some agenda.

And Michelle Yeoh was a self-absorbed, conceited, egotistical winner. Not once did she recognize the wonderful performances of the other nominees. What a snub to those ladies.

The best picture was probably The Whale which wasn't even nominated. Brendan Frasier was just amazing.

The Fablemans was a wonderful movie and deserving of BP. The wrong Michelle won the best actress award.

All Quiet was an epic and normally the BP.

Elvis was another great movie.

Women Talking is really good. A sleeper.

So many excellent choices. You blew it Academy.",2
21 May 2022,"Bloated nonsense, overlong and meaningless.","If this movie wasn' so overhyped and so overrated, I would just dismiss it as a meh kind of movie. But as it is so overhyped and overrated, I kind of start to hate it.

But to not waste a lot more time on this nonsense, I will just point out the main reasons why the movie failed for me.

1.) The movie failed to establish an emotional connection between the viewer and what is happening on the screen i. E. in the movie. One of the reasons for that being: the movie was driven by nonsense. Whenever the main characters are stuck in a situation, the have to perform some nonensical bullcrap, so that they can crazy-deus-ex-machina their way out of the situation. Again and again and again and again and again.

2.) The other reason for the failed emotional connection is that there were no sympathetic characters given to connect with. Everyone is just a self-absorbed a-hole or douchebag. What they are fighting for is a chaotic piled up mess (because they are unable to fix anything and to improve, so they prefer having a meanignless mess to having nothing).

So, my main problem was: I just didn't care for anything happening in the movie.

If you think that it is a profound philosophical question to ask how your life would be if you would have sausages for fingers (just to give you an example), this may be a movie you. But if you think that such a question is just stupid and stopped being funny since you turned 8 years old, maybe you should avoid spending timeor money on this movie.

But there are some few reddeming qualities of this movie, hence I did give it 3/10.

Which are:








But again, at the end of the day, I didn't care for the pile of nonsense that the movie is.",3

11 June 2022,All At Once Everything Everywhere Was Original But A Lacking Let Down In Its Visual Flow!,"Hollywood has drifted into another phase of repetitive story plot films, the ""Multiverse"" era. In the superhero fantasy world it works tremendously (and may do so in non fantasy films of the future) but, it failed totally in this films story. I love Michelle Yeoh as an actress - I have followed and watched her screen career for many years - and it made for the only reason I watched this; having read the film synopsis in the press outputs, I was not impressed and would have given it a miss but for her being in it.

The trouble with the film is that we are given no reason whatsoever (neither at the start and right to the finish line) as to why everything was happening and, the causes that led up to it. It just jumps straight into a 3 parts cacophony of riotous confusion. The comedy throughout was very few and far between, though a couple of scenes gave rise to a big smile from me, and therefore, I can only assume that all the reviewers are very easily amused by scenes that were meant to be comical but just lacked that sincerity and timing. With the complexed plot it was attempting to draw the viewer in with it should have had a far better explanation.

I was also very disappointed to see Michelle Yeoh in a film with the ""F"" word in it (she never does that kind of film work as far as I am aware) and, to be honest there was no real reason to use it here; something like, ""Oh crap!"" would have sufficed instead!

I, if asked by my circle of friends, would only tell them to not expect anything hilariously funny, logical or reasonably enjoyable and, to forget about any forewarning insight into the unfolding plot. Its a very well presented digital visual of technical excellence (the reason why I have given it a 5 star) but, its a dull 2hr:12mins and the worst film I have ever seen Michelle (Yeoh) act in.",5

14 July 2022,Lots of LGBT propaganda,"Not as good as they say.

First hour is okay-if you decide to ignore the blatant lgbt propaganda shoved into your face as early as the establishing shots.

The gradual introduction of the multiverse will leave most viewers confused, since we never get a clear idea of how things work.

It simply is a plot device which allows the filmmakers to get away with anything.

From sixty to ninety minutes the action kicks in and things get better, but it does not last for long. You will know when the good part is over because The End is going to appear on the screen.

The trouble begins after the fake ending credits. The remaining forty minutes are the most goddamn awful thing you've ever seen. It was excruciatingly painful to deal with those. Each second was a masterclass in cringiness, sappiness, and ultra boredom. Kinda like a Chinese blockbuster, only worse!",5
23 October 2022,Overcooked and cheesy...,"What a waste of time....seriously...it tries to tackle some very serious things in a funny way...but after half an hour all the fun feels old..repetitive...and overlong...the absurdity of life can be fun...but this movie tries to tackle them with cheesy old cliches

The movies highly rated by critics these days are just like this...in order to be politically correct and to break new ground...they just end up inane , stupid and absurd...

How on earth this movie has an 8+ rating on IMDB is beyond comprehension...

Just watch Michael Gondry if u want similar mind bending plot but with a lot more fun and sense...

Kind of wasted my 2 hour.just avoid.

19 January 2023,Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time - most accurate,"The Guardian review para-titled ""Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time"", remains the most accurate review I have come across to date on this colossal waste of time, unless you actually read the plot synopsis that contains ""insane adventure"" and ""other universes"" and then still proceeded to watch two hours and twenty minutes of gen Z hyper nonsense.

This failed attempt at inspirational movie making from an industry largely bereft of an original thought, will no doubt feed the coffers of its producers, by those still caught up in over-hyped media messaging, delusional story lines, and possibly kaleidoscopes.

Gen Z Oscar bait if ever there was one.

The best part of the Movie is Jamie lee Curtis. She makes a truly believable tax auditor. It could have been her calling if she didn't get pulled into acting. Turns out that no matter where life takes you and the choices you make it still works out the same. For everyone, everywhere, all the time.

Im open person to watch any kind of movies but if a movie is that bad I just can't, don't know why chuck Norris didn't won oscars back in the days then, he is by far better actor then anyone in this movie, and im not joking about that. Please Hollywood just stop giving awards do movies which don't deserve it, it takes future movies into this terrible direction.

26 November 2022,Simply Not Good,"I really like the actors in this film but this was bad. I watched it twice in hopes that the second time would be a winner. I thought it was me but after speaking with other movie lovers in my circle they felt the same way I did it was a waste of time the only exception was Jamie Lee Curtis she made it bearable and brought some humor to an otherwise bad script and a couple of good fight sequences. I felt that it was confusing at some points and very slow at others. It appears that they were working to hard at trying to get a message of acceptance across. I totally was cool with the messaging but they over did it and it went left and got boring.

18 December 2022,Over hyped,"This movie is over hyped. It is a cheap cheesy version of The Matrix. The plot had been used several times in other films. It is also very long and should have been edited. It is very Confusing at times. I did not like it at all. The movie is special maybe because it has diverse characters with more Asian representation. It is trying hard to be like The Matrix infused with family/ mother daughter/ father daughter drama with a touch of gay story.

Nevertheless, Michelle Yeoh is great in here except for corny seen before misuttered English words. I like her better in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

3 July 2022,If you want to get dizzy watch this,"This is one of those pretentious drivel that everyone is keen to gulp down and rate 10/10. The speed of things going on is ridiculous. Then you have scenes where the lights are flashing as if to induce a seizure. Lastly, you have long drawn out scenes in either slow-mo or super slow dialogue. The movie is way too long for its own good and loses its charm by the 30 minute mark.

8 February 2023,"Sentimental Ending, Disappointing Journey","I recently watched a movie that has received mixed reviews from the audience and I must say, I understand why. When I first started watching it, I was drawn in by the visuals and the ambitious editing style. However, as the movie progressed, I found myself getting more and more confused. The storyline lacked coherence and meaning, making it difficult for me to follow along.

The long running time also didn't help matters, as it made the experience even more tedious. What was particularly frustrating was the awkward explanation of the filmmakers' intent, which only added to the confusion. I couldn't help but feel that the movie was trying to be too pretentious and showy.

Another issue I had with the movie was the characters. I found them to be annoying and uninteresting, which made it even harder for me to engage with the story. The ending was sentimental and, in my opinion, a way to forget the painful experience of watching the movie. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to wrap things up quickly and make the audience forget the confusing and lackluster journey they had just gone through.

Overall, my experience with this movie was negative. I wouldn't recommend it to others and would suggest they look for a more enjoyable and coherent film. The visuals and editing style were impressive, but they couldn't make up for the lack of coherence and the frustrating storyline.",4
15 October 2022,Exhausting,"""Exhausting"" is the one word review that I wanted to leave here but am not permitted to because of the minimum character requirement for these reviews. But ""exhausting"" really does say it all. From the get-go this film assaults you with input from a thousand directions. You feel as though you're being overwhelmingly battered by two or three prize fighters at once, but the rounds aren't three minutes, they are more like 120 minutes. So, no respite or opportunity to regroup. It just keeps jerking you around without mercy. I was able to stay with it for about thirty minutes, then I had to just turn it off. I'll say it again, it's just simply exhausting. Good luck to you if you want to give it a try.

6 June 2022,It's just family guy in a different medium,"Terrible, convoluted movie, with a weird plot and weirder execution. Not worth the hype it's getting. It takes forever for the plot to move forward. Yeah some visuals are great, but it doesn't offset the other trashy parts you've gotta sit through.

10 October 2022,"Disjointed, perplexing story line makes it a disappointing, difficult watch.","There are two reasons why I wanted to see this movie. One, it had a high rating of 8.1 and two it was considered a high probability of being selected for the award of best film, for Michelle Yeoh for best actress, for Jamie Lee Curtis for best supporting actress and for Ke Huey Kwan for best supporting actor. While the acting awards seemed justified since the acting was good, I have very strong reservations about the best picture bit. The movie described in Wikipedia as an ""absurdist science fiction comedy drama"" is extremely difficult to sit through and a torturous watch for most of the time. It can be described as inane, bizarre, aweful, nonsensical, chaotic, crazy, strange, trite, mind numbing, cringe worthy and basically an assault on the senses which drains you physically and mentally. After the first 40 minutes starts the madness which gets worse with time. The fights, the VFX, the fast paced martial arts, the high decibel music are okay for some time but it gets excruciating if one has to sit through for 2 hour 19 minutes of runtime. I was disappointed big time. The background of a parallel universe with virtual reality didn't help to make things interesting and made it look strange. The disjointed, meandering and confusing narrative and the superfast editing pace had me flummoxed. What a mess it looked.",3
28 May 2022,Okay comedy but to long.,"Funny movie but I feel it could have been much shorter as it became very long to sit and watch this to the end. They could have cut about 30 minutes of this movie and it would have been better IMO.

4 June 2022,Studio paying critics,"I went in ready to like this. I love multiverse and creative movies. After seeing this, I can only assumed this is all marketing hype and critics getting a nice paycheck. The movie has boring characters, overstay it's welcome, and is boring. Go watch into the spider verse again and skip this one.

8 June 2022,A incredibly boring and long rip off of any Rick and Morty episode,"If you want to watch a super long Rick & Morty episode but with bad jokes instead (jokes in the style of the scary movies franchise) you might enjoy this rubbish. If that's not what you are looking for, don't waste your money or your time. Really really bad.

23 December 2022,I must have missed something?,"The two stars are for Ke Huy Quan's acting. He was really good in all his different roles and his whole aura changed with each personality.

The only thing that kept me watching till the end was the thought that surely it would get better. Well, to me it didn't. It was just all random rubbish thrown together. I like and admire Michelle Yeoh a lot, so I'm disappointed that she got involved in this. There were so many points when I really physically wanted to throw up because of what I was seeing on screen.

It was awful. It made no sense. It was like the writers just tried to find things that were as stupid as possible to put together. Why did such big names sign on? I don't know. Don't waste your time.

21 May 2022,What the heck is this?,"My wife and I waded through about 25 mins of this horrid mess, just waiting for a movie to appear, it did not.

Why this poorly scripted waste of talent was labeled in part a comedy / adventure is no more than false advertising.

To say this movie is a disjointed mess is a compliment. We are still trying to understand why it was even made and whether or not the writer was high on drugs when writing it.

A real stinker in every way.

25 April 2022,"Lost in translation, too confusing.","I don't understand what the director or writer was thinking. There are 3 main people the story is based on. Each of these characters have 3 or more stories explaining their stories and they keep jumping for story to story to story. Confusing the heck out of you. And then a couple sub-characters also have stories going on. After the 1st few minutes you are so confused. If you like multiple storylines running all the same time. Then this movie is for you. Personally I like a more direct simpler storyline. Maybe the director was trying to explain everything but having over 10 storylines running at the same time. Is a bit much for me.

17 September 2022,"Everything Everywhere All at Once, but a good movie","It's been years since I have seen such a bad movie. Everything is just a nonsense with a ver infantil humor. It tried to be a philosophical film with a deep message but it just a great waste of two hours.

The original idea is great but,√± the execution is horrible: it's s not funny, it's not deep, it's just plan boring. Right know I'm written this review while the movie is still running but I could not care less about losing some of it.

I give it a 2 instead a 1 because Michelle Yeoh does a great role.

I wish I can see the reviews of the users which have given this movie a 8.2 so I can avoid their future recommendations.

26 May 2022,Love - Family - Multiverse Concept with Messy Storyline,"Love - Family - Multiverse Concept with Messy Storyline.

Wait storyline? It barely has a storyline. This movie only wanna show how good Michelle Yeoh fighting skill. Fight here and there - no strong concept. And I just waste my time to watch this. I don't know why this rated 8.5 but it is definitely only a 1 star for me.

Trailer is good. Interesting but when it comes to full movie? Very bad and so beyond absurd. I will skip it if it runs in local television..... just when i thought Kill Bill is the worse movie.

I personally found it very confusing with a chuckle thrown in here and there. My conclusion is that people that actually liked it must've been drunk or on drugs.

26 March 2023,Am I crazy for hating this film?,"I have seen just about every kind of movie out there. This is the worst.

This is my first imdb review because usually I don't care about sharing my opinion on a movie online but this time I have something I need to get of my chest.

I might have missed an explanation at the end as I left the cinema about 75 minutes in but what is going on? A lot of the people I've talked to actually enjoyed the whole movie and I'm stuck wondering if I'm just ""not getting it"".

I truly believe that this is the worst film I've ever seen and the reason I'm giving this review is to find out if I'm just crazy/not getting it or if this really is a legitimate waste of time. It's nothing short of ridiculous that it was nominated for an Oscar and, to me, downright criminal that it won.

How anyone could wholeheartedly enjoy and recommend it is beyond me.",1
28 January 2023,So overrated I cringed through the whole film,"I watched it because of the high ratings. I cringed physically throughout the whole film, literally face all cringed up and body sitting sideways towards the screen in disgust. This movie has no storyline at all just a bunch of lame jokes put together. It looks like a middle school student's project done with his childish buddies as a joke. Are people just afraid to say what they really think? Just having the multiverse concept doesn't make a movie good. Stick something up your ahole to teleport to another universe wow real funny you got me... and also what's up with the lgbt agenda? You have to guide your child on the right path that's literally the job of a parent. I rate this 1/10 just to bring balance to the ratings it really should be around 3 or 4 at most. The dad did well tho he's a good actor.

9 June 2022,The real story: Solipsism on Steroids,"""Look at me! I'm Evelyn! I might seem like a bland middle aged woman, but I'm the center of the universe. I'm the center of universes-ses-ses! I create universes. With every decision I make, another universe is born. In one universe I turn out to be a piano wizard, in others I'm a knife wizard, a martial arts wizard, a wizard of wizardry. There is an endless amount of glorious roads my life could take and thanks to the invention of parallel universes, some version of me is taking each and every one of them. But still, I, myself, I am the most important one. I didn't achieve much in my life, all my potentials still lie dormant, an explosive mixture, just waiting for a spark to ignite it.

I'm a quirky person. People love that about me. Sometimes I start to sing, sometimes I start to dance, or whatever. This movie about me is a quirky movie. Lots of fun stuff from science fiction movies, horror movies, kung fu movies has been thrown into a blender to create something that is as multi-faceted and fun as I am. So don't you dare to nitpick! Don't be a smart-aleck! This movie is not about logic. It is not about you!

This movie is about me realizing that even if I didn't do much with my life, I'm actually everything, everywhere, all at once.

My name is Evelyn, God of Gods! Look at me, you mighty, and despair!""

---

As I'm not Evelyn, I found the whole thing a bit boring, actually. This crazy, trippy, far out stuff wasn't my cup of tea. But obviously there are lots of Evelyns out there who really love it. So just ask yourself one question: Are you an Evelyn? Well, are you ...?

The funniest joke of this movie is the cardigan with ""PUNK"" written on the back that Evelyn wears. Vivienne Westwood, eat your heart out!",5
22 March 2023,"Nothing new for those who've watched ""Rick&Morty""","This movie is Not bad, is Not going to save you life, is not going to change your life, because for those of us who've watched the animated TV Show ""Rick&Morty"" this movie is nothing new!!.... as a matter of fact, I call it ""Rick&Morty"" for newbies!! Haha.

In general the concept of Multiverses has been done many times (Including the TV Show ""Loki"") so there is not a lot new in here

The acting is good but I still insist it should've been Jackie Chan playing the husband!! He has a far longer and more interesting career than ""Ke Huy Quan"", Jackie Chan was ROBBED of that oscar and other awards!! Such an injustice!

25 January 2023,So Terrible - I'd give a zero if I could,"I don't get the hype surrounding this film at all. Eleven! 11 Academy Award nominations, really?

I suffered through the entire movie hoping it would improve and wishing it would just end. It is the visual equivalent of a bad LSD trip . I wondered what kind of drugs the writers were on when they wrote this. I wanted to like this because I like Michelle Yeoh; I typically like SciFi movies; and I'd read that this was much better than Dr Strange MoM and it absolutely is NOT better, which is saying a lot because MoM is a chaotic mess.

I also asked my 30-something son to watch it so I could get the opinion of someone else who I know for a fact has common sense and who is not narcissistic or nuts like many of his peers. Looking forward to his comments.

My advice, don't wast your time.",1
26 March 2023,Not exactly Sci-fi and a tad predictable,"Well this was a disappointment at every level and another movie that could have been so much better with more character development. How this even has the Sci-fi moniker is beyond me as the connection is cheaply done by using rather poor wardrobe. It is tediously repetitive with too much unnecessary albeit well choreographed fight scenes. I guess they filled the gaps left by the mediocre story. Michelle Yeoh is a great actress but wasted here despite her Oscar, as all her acting was just changing her facial expression but she did have a few good lines. Jamie Lee did an okay job but an Oscar performance really. I guess it was another light year for great movies so they overhyped this one to get it through the door. It will be forgotten as quickly as you can say Kung Fu.

25 January 2023,"Amazingly imaginative beginning, but then . . .","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

17 March 2023,full of absurdity.,"It's full of absurdity. In undesired situations you search or imagine a way of escaping and jumping to another so called ""possible"" alternative universe of possibility. How can these screenplay writers even dare to build up a plot of extreme nonsense.. i don't really understand. What kind of mind stage is that.. they don't also forget to add also minority topics to the event. No words to add. Literally mind blowing in a negative way. If you would like to mention about the events of multiuniverse, check the presentations in Mr Nobody and also Interstellar that expressed the topic in a more sophisticated way.

17 January 2023,Frenetic activity and Subtitled so you can't watch the action,"While I know a lot of people really liked this movie, it's one major flaw is that for those who don't understand Mandarin and Cantonese have to read the subtitles. Since the action is all over the place, having to look at subtitles to be able to understand what is being said keeps you from being able to watch the movie to see what is happening. It's a terrible combination.

I found that after watching for about 45 minutes, I was exhausted and completely disinterested in watching any more of it.

They took a high-level topic of a multiverse and made a stupid movie about it. The activities were stupid. Their meeting with the IRS agent was stupid. Virtually everything in the movie was stupid. Not funny, not interesting, just frenetic, stupid, random activities.

I'd give it negative stars if that were a rating.

I'm glad we saw it for free, so I didn't waste anything but 45 minutes of my time on it.",1
26 January 2023,The intersection of dad jokes and things a teenager thinks up while high,"Is this a bad movie? No. Is it a good movie? Not really.

At its roots, the story is fairly simple: a woman finds out that she's the only one who can stop an evil(-ish) force. And she learns how to be a better person along the way. There aren't really any surprises as far as the story goes; it's a series of cliches that don't add up to much.

The action is basic. Nothing special, nothing particularly interesting. The humor is uncreative and lame: there's a Ratatouille spoof called Racacoonie (it's a raccoon); in an alternate universe, people have hot dog fingers; there's a bagel with literally everything on it... it feels like there's not a single idea that wouldn't fit on a Venn diagram crossover between dad jokes and things a teenager would think up while high.

The ending is the worst part. We know what's going to happen. We've seen it a thousand times before. But it just drags on and on and on. It could've easily shaved ten minutes off in the last half hour. Hell, maybe the whole last half hour could've been skipped.

I'd most recommend this for the ""film bro"" type and people who are shallow but think they're deep.",4
25 September 2022,Over hyped,"Paid to watch on Amazon with family expecting a real treat. Not sure why there are so many rave reviews, the film was like a bad trip, or as someone succinctly put it like surfing several channels until you get a chaotic storyline which makes no sense.

When it got to the bit where people had hotdog fingers we gave up.

Is like a bunch of teenagers on amphetamines brainstormed ideas for a movie, with one suggesting Kung fu, another suggesting South Korean family with predictable issues, another suggesting multi verse theory, and some suggesting a nod towards something profound which film goers will feel obligated to mention although they have been sold a dud.

A bit like the story of the Emporer who wore no clothes.

Everybody hyping it up because so many others are doing it and they don't want to look as if they have missed a trick.

Really can't understand how people can enjoy this, I stopped after 1 hour watching. I can that it has Asian characters and that it shows real life situations: taxes, stress, business etc but I don't think it deserved such the praise it did as I saw nothing special about this movie. I'm not a cinema connaisseur by any means so maybe I'm missing the art in this movie but I was hella not into it.

We love movies of all genres , but truly didn't like this one. The acting was good if there is something nice to say. Jamie Lee Curtis up for an Oscar for her role? Weren't there other roles more worthy? We didn't understand that either.

We kept watching as the beginning held our interest, but it just got too silly and crazy. It was just a big ridiculous mess. How so many others can claim this movie is a masterpiece is a complete mystery to us.

30 August 2022,What a load of old nonsense,"It seemed like a good premise at the start and the performances were good, but it quickly became too ridiculous. The attempts at humour were lame and not at all funny - like elementary school playground humour.

I find it hard to believe all the 10 and 9 star reviews are real reviewers and not Mechanical Turk. No 6s, 7s, or 8s? Just 9s and 10s! I'm adding this review in an attempt to redress the balance.

I went into this movie with high expectations but was severely let down. There's a false ""The End"" part way through the film and I thought, ""Thank god this drivel is over"", but then there was more.

It could maybe have been a good movie if they just dropped the juvenile comedy that didn't work and either replaced it with more grown-up humour or just left it out.",1

It's just a bunch of people from an Asian family in US that own a laundry and l from there the movie turns in and I'm incomprehensible story and nonsense fiction and confusing dialogues that lead nowhere at all!

12 June 2022,Not that good,"I've had really high expectations before watching the movie because the cast and the plot seemed really interesting.

Well, the first 15 minutes were interesting and promising. And then I suddenly it turned into a storyline which I couldn't follow anymore. I really wanted to be sucked into the whole plot, but it didn't work out. I had a feeling that too much attention was put into the costumes and action moves which resulted in the lack of any depth. I couldn't connect to the characters. It felt like they were having the same dialogue over and over again, although the scenes were changing rapidly. All in all, I was bored and couldn't wait for the movie to end.

18 May 2022,What the hell was that?,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

25 January 2023,Lobster anyone ?,"I can't help but mention The Lobster since I don't remember disliking a film as much since The Lobster . And I sat through this one thinking the same thing.. are we there yet? Will it ever end ? What's it about anyway? Did someone slip her a drug I didn't notice ? Was it caused by one of those games you put on your head and on her it triggered an unending distortion of reality? How about a nervous breakdown ? But then I'm told to not take it too seriously ??!! In college I never understood the books we had to read on symbolism. Is this a dose of that?? I give credit to the actors but that's where it ends . I hated it just like The Lobster .

10 July 2022,Entertaining but not a must-see,"It has its moments and entertaining parts. But this movie was over-hyped and in the end, is not a must-see movie. If you happen to catch it playing and there is nothing better on, then you may find some scenes here and there as fun and interesting. But overall, this movie will fade into obscurity because it's just not that good.

2 March 2023,Nauseating,"What in this Universe made this bloody and violent creation earn 11 Oscar nominations is beyond me.

Maybe the creative variety of violent tricks and methods of destroying and maiming human bodies appealed to many viewers, and yet I found non-stop creative bloody violence on the screen exhausting.

It is surprising how unconvincing and simple the idea behind the many minutes of loud senseless fighting turns out to be.

I haven't remembered leaving the movie theatre feeling disgusted and nauseous ever until today.

I gave the movie two stars though I feel the actors deserve much better ratings than the movie itself.",2
25 June 2022,"Everything going downhill and you throw up, smiling.","This is the best proof that fast pace and great look are for music clips. One should not call it a ""movie"". Specially when characterized as "" fantasy, comedy, action and sci-fi"", all at the same time. Nonsense , made for the TikTok generation. Comes from nothing, leads to nowhere. Shows how a high note on IMDB does not necessarily leads you to a great experience. Thankfully there are a lot of good movies been made nowadays. This is not one of them.

29 November 2022,"Wacky, too wacky","The main point of the story, that is, the hypothetical existence of multiple universes with all the lives you could have lived and being able to jump from one to the other, might be the basis for a good story. However, they decided to make a 100% wacky movie, with loads of visual effects, totally implausible endless kung-fu fighting, and very very little story. The sub-plots get also lost here: the gay daughter coming out of the closet to her conservative grandpa, the immigrant Chinese family, who had to adapt to the US and is struggling with the IRS. There's stuff here to tell a real story, and no need to flashy visual effects.

Add to this dubious production choices. Both main characters are portrayed by actors who are Cantonese speakers, but in the movie they are depicted talking in Mandarin to each other and in Cantonese to the grandpa. This won't impact English speaking viewers, but it only makes sense to add more confusion to the Chinese audience.

By the way, it was dificult to understand most of the uninspiring actors bacause of their thick chinese accent. All in all, they tried very hard to make a very original movie, but the outcome is a huge and depressing failure.

19 March 2023,Waste of time,"I actually signed up to IMDB, just to give my 2cts on this useless film. The actors look surprised the full length of the film, they don't have a clue what's going on, because there is frankly not a lot going on. The plot is just all over the place, trying to blend the Matrix with a bunch of other films, but fails miserably on virtually every cinematic quality one could think of.

There is no interesting storyline to speak of, no real sense of accomplishments, no goals in sight and none are achieved in the end. It's taking the most boring realities of plain life, and tries to spice it up with alternative universe mumbo jumbo. It is a mess, I promise you, and the film is not even trying to streamline it. It's like a bumbed down version of The Matrix, with pills lying everywhere, taken all at once, resulting in one giant mess.

I can't believe this film has gotten so many oscars. Perhaps it's a result of lacking competition?",1
3 September 2022,Do I live in a alternate Mulitiverse?,"Went in with high expectations but unfortunately this movie dissapointed me big time. The best part was the beginning but as soon as the action started and the so called plot thickened I ended up being rather dissapointed. I was really expecting the best movie of 2022 so far. The trailer was promising and after Rotten tomatoes held a poll on their Instagram page about A24's best movie ever , this one came out as a winner beating The Lighthouse and Uncut Gems, movies which I enjoyed.

Too much action scenes. And what's up with the bagel? And what about all the crazy costumes? After I read the positive reviews again I slowly realized; Do I live in a Multiverse?

You feel like the time stops while watching this movie ! It just never get to its end!! The story line is very hard to follow though I guess it doesn't have any ! To complete this tragedy piece in cinema history, the actors have also contributed their share and you totally can see everything is fake although the director of this so-called movie has failed to observe it apparently.

19 March 2023,Too bizarre...,"I was excited to see this because of all the Oscars it won. But I was very disappointed...

The concept of the movie is really cool and it had potential to be so good! There are just too many weird scenes, and for me it was a bit too much. It distracted from the main story. Parts of the movie are just so strange!!! I feel like if it was a little more serious and the alternate universes were more realistic it would have been really good.

I will say the acting was great and the visual effects were pretty good too. I also enjoyed the overall themes of the movie. I just had to look past all the super weird parts to actually enjoy the movie.

Overall, as creative as the movie is, it did not live up to the hype.

Next day decided to finish it no mater what, only cause of high rating. Wanted to drop after 15 min. Was hoping it'll get better , it didn't. I'm very open minded and SiFi leaning, can tolerate a lot of outside the box thinking, but this one is not my cup of tea, fer sure. Mix of Matrix+Kung fu Hustle + Spider Man multiverse + sprinkled with trivial message : love each other, be kind. I love all of those individually , but this hush push was not a winner to me.

5 June 2022,"Exaggerated ""comedy"" scenes that make you rather roll your eyes","I cannot agree with the overall rating. The beginning was promising and it was a good intro, but the plot got really messy and you could barely follow what is happening. The movie was overly filled with exaggerated scenes of cheap humor that rather triggered a reaction of ""Oh, come on"". Possibly more entertaining for youth rather than people in late twenties or older.

The idea itself is good, but it wasn't very well put into the movie. If I wasn't watching this movie in the cinema, I would stop watching it in the middle of it, but I am, in the end glad that I saw till end because of the last scenes, which were actually alright and earned one more star for the rating.

It's not a comedy nor scify nor action nor kunfu... it confused me and i was thinking to go out and finish my torture. It reminds me another really bad film: The avengers of Sean Connery but in thar case the critics were honest an was very low rated. I recommend you dont watch it if you usually like common films. Im expected wating the awards: i cant believe if it is going to win any Oscar, the members of the Academy should be sincere and forget this film forever or something has washed their brains. Ugg.

It's like picking thru the mind of an elderly Asian woman and learning why she hates her life, why she can't figure out her lesbian daughter, then blames her dad for it all. That's it in a nutshell. If you got the time to sit down and go thru their philosophy, this is your thing. I've heard people mention ""nihilism"". Nah...it's ""absurdism"" all the way. People walked out, not to come back, just to walk out.... I cheered them on. It was an experience..that, ultimately, wasn't my thing. I'm not glad I saw this.

22 October 2022,Disappointing -- good message buried in MOUNDS of rubble.,"Serious disappointment. Considering the cast drawn together for this film, It had such potential, especially considering the concept behind the story. It takes a grand concept and falls victim to the challenge of trying to do everything everywhere all at once. If you're familiar with the movie ""Up"", just imagine ""squirrel"" distractions 96% throughout the film. There is an element in the movie the characters seek to avoid (unless you've been drawn in and then they are driven towards it: a bagel - yes a bagel. Mushrooms would have served better because consuming bagels before making a movie never ended so badly. The story -- the core of it -- could have been relayed in about 12 minutes. The rest was belabored. The acting was notable, especially by Quan. Hsu and Yeoh have the standout moments as well where they either are on mark or draw you in to the story, but this movie is ridden with so much that weighs it down -- who knew fluff could be so heavy?? Do yourself a favor and go buy a bagel instead - don't get sucked in. Either that or eat some mushrooms (not recommended) and make your own movie... it can't be any worse.",1

20 April 2022,A celebration of nihilism,"I thought I'd love this movie but ended up leaving overwhelmed and at odds with the nihilistic message. It is unique, and it looks like it has a much higher budget than it had, but ultimately it felt like a tornado symbolizing the supposed joy behind embracing a collective loss of meaning. There were a huge amount of cuts in the film making it seem like a music video more than a movie in some places. The action was well choreographed and there were some genuinely funny moments, but it felt as though it was selling and celebrating a nihilistic philosophy that assumes that all of one's actions are of no importance. That said, I predict that this will resonate with many people, and will become a modern classic as it is quite original, as well as acting as apologetics for postmodern living. There was a lot to like about the film, but I couldn't like it overall due to its terrible messages.

This isn'tscience fiction. It's science crap. A load of rubbish with poorly explained rules and the rules that were interested didn't seem to really apply anyway.

13 January 2023,I don't get it at all ...,"I saw this film being nominated for an award, so I thought I would give it a whirl. Jamie Lee Curtis and Yeoh plus a recommended story line, I had high hopes. It was over 2 hours of my life I will not get back. It is confusing, difficult to follow and exhausting as the film jumps between subtitles and English. I guess that the story was well intentioned and there is obviously a huge following who enjoyed the film and its randomness. It certainly ranks high in the 'weirdness' scale. Somewhere in the multiverse there is a version of this which I will understand, but I fear that no matter how times that I watch this, its popularity baffles me.

The only nomination that made slight sense was for best actress, Michelle Yeoh.

It must be a slow year for movies. We kept watching hoping it would get better since the movie received so many nominations. It did not.

26 January 2023,a total mess,"Plot that doesn't lead anywhere, poor acting, more than 2 hours of a complete chaos that leads nowhere.

If you watch it, I can pretty much guarantee you won't watch it again. Ever. If this movie was meant to be a joke I didn't get it. And the fact that this movie is in the academy awards is a shame.

3 August 2022,Daniels's humor got me and Michelle was the star,"I thought the premise was original to an extent. I enjoyed the humour of the Daniel's working together. Great concept, vision and humour. I think I suffered seizures from the constant camera cutting and this time, there were no warnings. A veteran director working with the Daniel's might have helped the final edit of the movie.

21 October 2022,Bored to death,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

21 August 2022,"Ready for fun, got none","This movie spent tons of time having to explain itself and in the end couldn't make up its mind what the story was supposed to mean. A movie that goes for style over substance, melted down 3 Stoogies slapstick, and retred Jackie Chan fight stunts. Pass.

28 October 2022,People pay your taxes,"The moral of the story, you can fix your relations with your family members, on several plains of multiple universes, you can get away with plenty of murders and get forgiveness, you can defeat an undefeatable adversary, but you can't escape taxes. That's a strong message. Apart from that, only clich√©s stolen from another movies, Matrix, Scary movie 5, all the other multiverse movies. Too long on the morality scenes, too boring since we knew how's gonna end a mile away. A solid 5, but far from ""The best movie of the year"". Women power, of course, It could not be the other way. My 2 cents. 4 stars.

13 March 2023,Disappointing,"I don't understand those Oscars.

Chaotic action , and I get distracted , The film cannot hold me in its plot. Jamie Lee Curtis is good in the role and entertaining, but without significant action.

I don't understand this movie I love science fiction, but it has to make sense.

One must be able to relate to something.

The 3 stars are to be able to keep hope for a good film.

And acting, which means that this film does not fall completely through.

A technically good film.

The entertainment value is low. I take nothing away from this movie but bewilderment and wasted time.

If you're looking for scifi that makes sense, look elsewhere.",3
26 March 2023,Bad movie,"The argument is simple. Probably a 10 years boy who has read some comic books will be able to create. The cinematography is confusing. The acting is average, nobody is really believing their own characters. The photography is worst than an average TV series. The special effects... bad. Then all the escatological jokes with fighting with dildos and the anal stuff. It is a no go everywhere and everything at once.

I was really expecting a blast after all those Oscars and I found this ridicule movie. Please don't waste your time and go watch the best movie of this year: All quiet in the western front.

5 June 2022,Very good story packaged with endless garbage.,"This won't take long.

It's a very moving story about the aging protagonist and her crumbling relationships with her closest people (husband, daughter, father).

The cast is excellent, the emotions genuine and the cinematography beautiful.

My problem is the fantasy garbage nonsense this movie had to be packaged with to resonate with the popcorn audience.

There is good weird and there is Tenet weird. This is the later and that is bad for my tastes..

12 March 2023,Bad time to quit drinking.,"If you're a student of the metaphysical and enjoy movies that are cerebral and preach then this is the movie for you. The people that gave this a good review are probably trying to justify the time they invested and money spent going to the the theater. I did not expect this movie to be linear but there seemed to be so many different aspects that it was almost impossible to assimilate where it was heading. It's somewhat anticlimactic and takes forever to get there. There were many parts that could have been left on cutting room floor. I gave this a two because I love Michelle Yeoh (have seen all her movies) and she deserves best actress for doing an amazing job. The acting in general was good and somewhat helped to redeem watching.

13 March 2023,Photocopy of Shrek,"This movie should have got caught for plagiarism, I felt I was watching a crappy version of shrek - same storyline and exactly the same message at the end.

I think Oscar people just wanted to make a point by giving award to non-white actors and movie and this piece of BS got lucky - right time, right place!

Starts similar way as Shrek, when he is bored of his life and wanted to explore and experiment different things. Comes across wizard by signing a day of his life, goes through hell and back the entire journey with an happy go lucky ending finally realising nothing can be better than good old boring lifestyle....

Sure, you can figure out the ""plot"" - but why bother? The entitled producers of Hollywood owe the paying public more than this.

I realize people have different tastes, but this movie was not for me. It was so bad that after about 40 minutes I could not force myself to watch anymore. The reviews are also artificially inflated on amazon as well...Amazon doesn't let you review the movie unless you watch the whole thing, so guaranteed there are other people who would rate it low but their reviews are not allowed. For reference which movies do I like: Fight Club, The Matrix are probably my favorites. TV series: I loved DEVS and Breaking Bad.

14 March 2023,This rated higher than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. WTF,"I don't usually walk out of movies but I just stopped caring what was going on after about 15 minutes. I gave it a chance because i loved Michelle Yeoh in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. What a confused mess of a movie. Just colourful flashy fight scenes , regular lols and the occasional pasted-in dialogue that apparently is meant to make me connect with one of the characters.

It actually makes me sad that this got 7 Oscars and rates higher on IMDB than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. To watch CTHD and then watch this just serves to highlight how good and how bad a movie can be.

Maybe if I had the attention span and emotional range of a peanut I might find it amusing or interesting.

This movie is from that moment onwards really a mess and especially the fragmented and bad storytelling makes that I lost interest. I find this movie worth no more than a 4. Also I regret to have spend al, that money for the tickets.

21 January 2023,Too much for me,"It seems there would be a lot of ways to tell a story of a woman learning to appreciate her life and that kindness and understanding can have a positive impact on those around her. I really liked the actors and where this tale ended but my gosh what a long, repetitive, flashy two hours to get to that point. As others have said: I was done with the Marshall arts, universe travel, ""comedy"" after about 20 minutes. It went on so long that I barely made it to the end. I wondered how people would choose this movie over Banshees of Inisheren or The Fabelmans as the best film of the year. It was too much!

14 May 2023,All At Once!,"I have never seen a movie like this. This is the best movie for multiverse lovers. Much better than Doctor Strange. A mix between Matrix, Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, Inception, and Terrence and Phillip from South park. Science Fiction, Kung-Fu, A surprising amount of emotional depth,It's got Everything! But maybe just a tad of The Emperor's New Clothes to it. You like the characters. Seems like a close knit family struggling with the same day-in, day out issues that we all have to deal with. I'm just not comfortable with this ""what if"" multiverse story-line. The cast deserves awards as a whole.. The movie starts strong, but drags on. Then it proceeds to go into the absurd.

18 March 2023,It finally happened.....,"I've finally met the movie that is so horrendously bad it propelled me to create an IMDB account.....

The movie took the concept of multiverse and did some interesting things, I'll give it that. The rest? Don't expect anything good anywhere else. Non-existent plot, poor character development, and overused slapstick humour.

From the beginning till the very end, I never understood what the villain wanted, why the main character decided to do what she did, nothing ties together. It's all just a hot mess

After Black Panther and this movie, the Oscars has lost all credibilities. The fact this movie won 7 Oscars makes me sincerely worry about the mental health of our society.

11 March 2023,"A cross between Cloud Atlas, The Matrix and The Emperor's New Clothes","I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

3 June 2022,I missed a good storyline,"I found the film to be very lengthy and would have preferred to leave the cinema earlier. The plot was just done on artful, but there was nothing behind it. The pseudo-philosophical interpretations could have been brought across better than these constantly repetitive and boring scenes. You could hardly build a relationship with the characters. The emotions were completely absent.

18 May 2022,Bizarre Movie,"This movie was none of the things I thought it would be. Completely beyond me how this is receiving high ratings.

It's all over the place related to the rules it establishes for it's universe. Without spoiling anything there is no way you could randomly evoke an instance of yourself with specific sets of skills. It would take a million tries but with this... no.

If you put even the slightest thought into this it falls apart.

The other thing is they often go quite low brow with the humor and its usually not very funny. I did laugh a few times at random but most of the bits missed me.

3 June 2022,"Good ideas, poor execution","I had high hopes for this movie. I grew up watching Michelle Yeoh before she broke onto the Hollywood screen. The plot is interesting and creative, but the execution was poor. It was hard to make heads or tails between scenes once I got to the second half of the movie.

There are several entertaining scenes on each of their own, but overall as the movie progressed it got kind of ridiculous and melodramatic. I found myself sighing and rolling my eyes then checked my phone to see how much longer it had left.

Despite how much I like Michelle Yeoh and how glad I am to see an Asian-American movie making it big in Hollywood, I kind of hated this movie. Sorry not sorry.

28 January 2023,Terrible,"Didn't understand it. Didn't like it. If felt like a huge 140-minute crazy nonsense videoclip. Or perhaps a collage of multiple disturbing TikToks. There's no need to accumulate reels to reach 140 minutes in a movie! I stopped watching it at the half, which I do very rarely. The other Best Picture movies of this year are way better than this one. They have pauses, they have a script and real life elements. I tried to get the modern acid trip this movie tried to propose but I just couldn't grasp it. If this is the goal, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is better than this, just as a quick comparison. Bottom line: don't waste your time with this.

Yes, it's an assault on the senses and those describing it as an acid trip are likely quite correct. But for me, those are not positive qualities.

31 May 2022,What is happening with these reviews?,"I was really looking forward to this movie based on early reviews and I have never been so disappointed and confused by the end of a film. This movie starts off really promisingly,solid character work and an intriguing plot. Then everything goes off the rails at around the 1 hour mark. This seems to be the main praise from all the 9/10 star reviews, but I have to ask whether these people enjoyed what they were watching, or simply want to support creative cinema despite how watchable it is. Im all for expression and out of the box ideas, but the narrative completely falls apart by the last 30 minutes, recycling the same ""epiphany"" type scene over and over again until the point of complete boredom. Iv never wanted a film to end more whilst being in the cinema as I was so frustrated and burnt out by the end.

28 June 2022,Laundry Shop Matrix for Stoners,"This film make a strong case for not packaging a series pilot as a film - there were too many arcs in this stoner sci-fi to be coherently held together in a film, even one as long as this. It is rich and effusive, unusual, hilarious and even challenging at times, but at heart, it is a forgetable Hollywood sci-fi film with great pretensions at low budget cinematic art. A brilliant failed series that makes for a rather ordinary, if bright and colourful blockbuster.

26 April 2022,Would've been great 10 years ago,"This movie was definitely a trip like others mentioned, but one I would've walked out on if I wasn't with friends. The sheer amount of ridiculous and juvenile humor would've worked a lot better when that style of humor was popular in the early 2010s, but now it just seems too cheesy and annoying for my liking. The last act of the movie is definitely more enjoyable than the rest of it and the overall message was good, but I can't see why people thought this movie was one of the greatest of the decade. To each their own I suppose.

5 March 2023,"The trailer was far better than the movie, but sums it up fine, confused? You will be!","A few funny moments, some Scifi inspired elements, and insane violent action scenes that distracts you from the deeper meaning, if any. You can always find some lessons from certain parts, but you have to do the whole work yourself.

If a movie has to be explained and be watched with a guide to be able to follow it and get it, then I don't care to watch it.

I like to watch a movie where we have to figure out things and they don't overexplain every detail, but here I got the impression that the more confusing the made it the better they felt it would be, like the whole goal was to only be artistic yet pointless.

I felt a huge let down from a over hyped movie, I expected some universal qualities and didn't find then, when the movie finished it was a strong anti climax, just wasted an evening with that nonsense.",2
12 February 2023,Stunning and disturbing,"I felt drawn into this movie from the very strange beginning. From there it got stranger and stranger and disturbing. As soon as I saw the ""awards"" I knew there would be something bad on the screen and I wasn't wrong about that. If I had known that scene was in the movie there's no way I would have watched it. I don't think the alternative lifestyle theme took the movie anywhere either and was more of a distraction than anything else. The actors themselves were absolutely fantastic. I really enjoyed all of them. I'm giving the movie a 5 out of 10 because it was very well made but ultimately disturbing. Time for some mental bleach.

17 September 2022,"ANYTHING ELSE, ANYWHERE...BUT NOT THIS MOVIE!","I have never been driven to write a review on IMDB until I watched this movie and I've been using IMDB for years. Basically, it's schmaltzy sugar-laden mother/daughter relationship drivel wrapped up in some over-the-top martial arts, mixed with some implausible sci-fi meanderings and topped off with some childish, peurile attemps at comedy. The result is a mish-mash of confused, messy, pseudo waffle that pretends to try answer some of life's biggest questions....or was it just the craziest most pointless load of twoddle ever committed to film.....honestly I couldn't wait for it to end....give it a miss and go and do something....anywhere.......but not watching this movie.

29 March 2023,Torn between a rating of 1 and 10. Literally,"On the one hand it has the deep message that others have referred to coupled with complete originality and imaginative production. On the other hand it's 2+ hrs of my life I won't get back and for no real entertainment value.

Not sure that I want to spend any more time entering the minimum 600 characters on this review which kind of suggests that a rating of one is where I'm leaning on this. I don't leave many reviews but value the input of those that do. So adding my tenpeneth worth on this one. Hope it helps others make an informed view. Watch this for 30 mins to get a sense of the creativity that has gone into this and then switch over.

In case of this movie it is very poorly executed. It's a complete waste of time I feel. I really don't know how this movie got so many positive reviews. It is just total chaos.

18 September 2022,"Messy, disconnected concept that doesn't work","There are some good parts. Conceptually interesting and starts with promise but gets more disconnected and messy as the film progresses. Some acts are just pointless showing of of directorial skills, some to fit in fights scenes perhaps. Some I can't fathom their purpose. I get the central concept that life is messy and so the film tries to convey that in its structure but it's really over done.

It's a shame as somewhere in this mess there is a better film trying to get out. One that is probably 30 minutes shorter. Perhaps one day we'll see it although I'm not sure having lost over two hours of my life I'd be willing to risk it again.

I went to see the movie because it was recommended by friends but I mean this is so silly, the whole idea is sooo silly. What's wrong with people nowadays, we had so many western flops that we ended up liking these terrible movies. My partner wanted to go before the film ended but until the end i tried to make it look good and i added as many positive comments as i could. This was a punishment, torment ment to punish you. The only feeling i felt after i left the cinema that day was disappointment and low energy. Have a good day.

They speak English 90% of the time, but just randomly slip back and forth with subtitles. Those of us that have impaired vision skip movies with subtitles. But the worst for us are movies that randomly go subtitles and foreign language off and on. Probably doesn't matter to most, but unwatchable for people with vision problems.

16 January 2023,What were the Critics Choice Awards thinking?,"One of the absolute worst films I've ever seen. I couldn't get through half of it. I don't understand the high ratings it has received. Am I watching the same film? Not only is it NOT funny, but it's far-fetched, ridiculous and doesn't even have a good plot line. It put me in the worst mood bc I will not get that hour back.

The acting is way over the top. I'm surprised Jamie Lee Curtis agreed to this film, but then again, she did Halloween, so there you go. Save yourself two hours and do not bother with this film (if you even want to call it that), unless you enjoy the genre that ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" falls in. What a waste!

5 March 2023,Absurdly bizarre film,"This is a non sense and absurd movie. Overrating is evidence that is a total error to trust what people think is entertainment that deserves to win awards. That reminds me why I preferred to see a list of awarded films instead of watching a boring event that last hours, watching how overrated movies like this are nominated.

Some critics refer to some deep thoughts mentioned in ten seconds of the movie, but that doesn't justifies wasting 140 minutes of your time; so disappointing. If your inner voice make you react and take you back to this line of the multiverse to take the remote control and skip some grotesque scenes, then there is still hope for you, if not, we'll most likely your mind is already trapped in an alternate reality.

Hope that you can cleanse your mind after throwing this content on it.

23 October 2022,terrible waste of time,"Jesus christ this is a terrible movie. It is like Rick and Morty if Rick and Morty was unfunny and a movie. A lot of cringe parts and the only humor they could muster was lowest common denominator. I don't find it hilarious that they fought with giant dildos, or that they had to shove a giant butt plug up their ass to fight. I've gone to middle school so I've heard those jokes before.

It is also incredibly long and boring, and when it is finally over, no it's not, there's still two more gd parts. The majority of this movie was either terrible, sophomoric 'comedy' or fight scenes that were done horribly and are incredibly unrealistic.

I am so angry I wasted two hours on this I will never get back, and shocked that people enjoyed this. Maybe if you are really immature and not that smart you will like it, but if you like actually good movies you should find something else to watch.

25 September 2022,Not sure what other people see in this movie.,"This movie does not know what it wants to be. Poor dialouge, universe jumping, forgettable characters. It has the makings of a low brain but high budget sci fi thriller. It was hard to watch all the way through and continually lost interest with so many fast cuts. I do love sci fi and even much slower paced films like Stalker of Blade runner 2049 but those had an intriguing story that really carried the plot along. It almost just seemed like the director was just trying to cram as many random things and plot elements in at once to wow the audience. Like this movie was made for a tik tok attention span. I just don't understand the appeal of this film.

10 July 2022,Mediocre Attempt at Philosophical Cinema with Many Flaws.,"This movie was too long it got me weary and movies are not supposed to do that. This movie is not for general audiences that was clear. It is for a segmented group and even then, many may not see it for what it was; a cultural fusion of Asian / gay with a twist of alien philosophies that are based on a chaotic take on multiple universes. Think of this as two camps; one born out of Atheism and the other from religion. Religion views it as one universe that is orderly while the other chaotic. But this movie falls flat on its face because it proposes that from viewing / participating from a alternate, chaotic universe you could solve your earthly problems. This is not impressive philosophy but rather bland and flawed and the creators tried to make up for it with some feeble comic elements. Another nuisance was the constant barrage of fast cross cutting and cutaway in and out of parallel universes. This is only done one or 2 times preferably in the 3rd act to tie loose ends to give audiences insight into the character's feelings and thoughts, but here it felt like we are engaged in a video game.

10 June 2022,What was this?,"Let me start by saying that I loved all the actors! They really did a magnificent job with the material they had. Frankly, I wish I could see them more often in more movies because they are real good.

I literally do not understand why this movie is considered as ""great, amazing and revolutionary"". It's really a disjointed story with no plot. Some even called it ""eccentric""!, But it really reflects on today's moviegoers attention span to follow a story, or have patience on how it builds up. The way it was edited, it was almost like scrolling through Instagram!

Wait until it streams save your money.

7 June 2022,Unfunny mess,"I give it one more star for being creative and trying something new but the film is disjointed, unfunny and cringy. I can't believe the reviews are so high for such a stupid movie that thinks it's better than it actually is.

16 January 2023,Huh ?,"There were so many accolades and awards for this movie, I was compelled to watch it. I'm actually only 45 minutes in, and I'm forcing myself to keep it on. I guess it's an either love or not love situation. Maybe I'll need to watch it 2 or 3 times. I can't imagine doing that. To illustrate complex personal relationships , life lessons and choices in such a visually discombobulated way, is just exhausting and annoying. An acquired taste I guess, but definitely not mine. Weird. Going to read all the glowing reviews to try to understand what I'm missing.

I do applaud the filmmakers, editors, special effects crew though....would have been as exhausting to make as to watch.

10 June 2022,I wish I liked it more,"True to the name, it was a two+ hour of everything mixed up in everywhere and all at once totally chaotic! This movie was one of the worst movies I've had to give up 2+ hours of my life to watch. I was expecting a comedy, instead I got a mish-mosh of everything and anything. After an hour, or so, I was still asking what the point was to the whole thing: Even my wife, who's not quite as critical of a movie as I am, agreed.

29 July 2022,Confusing to say the least,"I watched it twice to make sure that I hadn't missed anything. I still did not understand so many things. A lot of special effects and action, one more factor that makes me think ""what's the real plot / story"" behind it? I am giving it a 1 not so much because it deserves 1 star, but to try to tone down the unreasonable high ranking it has now. IMDB in the past 4/5 years is becoming more and more reliable on the rankings, 8.2 to this movie is simply out of any logic.

4 March 2023,a lot of manufactured hype,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

7 October 2022,Matrix 2.5,"Take a lifetime of ideas, and a whole lot of money, then fail in so many levels to get it right. This kind of film has been done so much better elsewhere. You see the kernels of good ideas, but they fall flat way too many times. Nice try in doing something that isn't just sequels or marvel movies, but you get the impression that they are desperatley trying to make a movie that will be heralded as the new cult movie for this decade. Set pieces lack the impact you would and should expect of a film with this amount of expectation they have given themselves... a strong 12 ot of 10 for trying too hard.

20 May 2022,Just good composition; the ideas aren't theirs.,"The film is entertaining because it is definitely absurd, and it's fun, but it's deeper elements are a composition of other people's ideas. Especially part two. You would think that either Daniel would be able to discuss the origins of the philosophical sentiments expressed in the movie if they were their own... but in any interview, neither can touch on the detail relating the concepts being tied together, not even remotely. But, somehow miraculously, they can present them in film? How is that? Because the ideas aren't Daniels'.

Because of that, I don't see them making another philosophically compelling movie after this. Kwan already admits this in his interviews, and it's likely for good reason.

1 May 2023,Ok but a bit nuts,"Some brilliant acting and vivid ideas and this also made me laugh a lot in places. There are some really funny scenes but also quite a bit that could have been left on the cutting room floor.

Its a bit Twin Peaks random in places, which doesn't always work and sometimes is just a bit too crazy for its own good. It's as if a few drunk guys, got a bit more drunk, ate some mushrooms and wrote a movie!

I'd actually recommend watching it, - it's a pretty seminal movie and very different to most things. But be warned, it's not an easy watch and is quite long.

In summary - like nothing you'll watch this year - some brilliant performances and a well crafted movie but be warned it is a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic!

4 March 2023,"The ""Emperor's New Clothes"" Strikes Again!","I have formulated an overview on society today and what it embraces as deep, meaningful and true: the Emperor's New Clothes syndrome. This movie, and the multitude of praise and hype it has garnered, reflects just how shallow, sophmoric and unthinking our society has become. Some of the acting was good, but the pretentious premiss was totally lacking in coherence and credibility. It was, however, a nice assembly of costumes which in themselves might garner an Academy Award, but that would be about it. The amount of time and money put into the brief displays of costuming don't translate into the disjointed undeveloped plot, which boils down to nothing more than a display of bloody martial arts with lots of high-school-boy-humor. Even Michelle Yeoh couldn't transcend those low moments...which are pervasive if you sit back and analyze the proceedings.

I felt no emotional connection with anyone in the film, despite the many tears milked in the hope that the audience would care enough about the characters to buy into them...which apparently a majority of reviewers did (!) Nothing deep or meaningful transpired in this movie...just the Emperor parading naked in front of his bamboozled subjects.",2

I had really high hopes for this movie as it was buzzed about so much.. really overhyped and I really like the main actress Michelle Yeo but I was so disappointed and it just didn't keep my attention. And so much violence! I also felt that half the dialogue was just gibberish. A lot of scenes just switched from one parallel world to the next and to me it just didn't make sense..

4 June 2022,"Panic attack, existential crisis, both at the same time","I can confidently say that this was one of the most insane movie experiences that I have ever been though. The key word here is experience- as it is not a film which you can simply 'watch'.

First things first- I can appreciate this as a great ode to filmmaking and a great example of it- it's a stunning work of visual art which twists every rule about film in a bonkers and entirely unique way.

Yet I simultaneously felt like I was going to combust with pure anxiety while watching it. Strobe effects warning? I think this film needs a heart condition warning. At one Kubrick-esque moment, me and my friend nearly (literally) pissed ourselves laughing. I involuntarily found myself shouting several profanities in pure awe, chaos, disgust and hilarity. This film had my body reacting in ways that I didn't think a film could, which was easily worth the ticket price and the act of watching it.

Towards the end though, I just wanted to get out of the theatre, go to the loo and catch my breath- which I think is both an amazing sign and quite a horrific one. The film's message really didn't hit me- but I don't really mind that it did, and am glad that many people found something within it. Because what I found was one of the most insane film experiences I have ever been subject to.

Now, let's calm down and have a nice cream cheese bagel.",4

The opening scenes are boring and elongated waffle and then the film clumsily transitions into a pseudo wacky tacky kungfu psychedelic mess. The rave 10 out of 10 reviews have a whiff of the Emperor's New Clothes about them. Given the repeated Laundromat scenes you would expect that bad smell to go away but the film gets worse the longer it's allowed to go on.

And it narows down to family relationships and dynamics that could be placed in completely different context and without unnecessary accelerated shots, multivereses (and interesected with slow motion fight scenes).

All in all, it looks like super long SNL skit, and not a funny one.

Super fast cuts, chaotic storyline, I need to talk to someone that rated 10 as I seemed to have missed something. Please go and see it as I am the minority. So far I considered IMDB as a serious source for good movie ratings. I am confused. Not only about the movie but also about my understanding about what makes a good movie.

10 July 2022,All at once forgettable,"I fell asleep half way through in the cinema... and when I woke up it did not matter how much I had missed. I didn't feel curious as to what I had dozed through because there was no progressive story line to follow. Just a compendium of individually non-essential scenes stitched together - any one of which could have been cut from the movie and we'd be none the wiser. It wasn't so much a plot as it was a premise, and so there was no plot to lose track of.

I feel like a basic dynamic was borrowed from Sense8 - the power to tap into multiple abilities from another dimension to get out of a fix. Even so, there was never any sense that the protagonist was in any real mortal danger.

There were moments of silliness and moments of sobriety that I appreciated... but on the whole, it felt mismatched.

At the end of the movie, I felt cheated: what appeared to be a literal, objective experience could very well have simply been an inner struggle of the protagonist worked out in her imagination.

The villain never once felt like a villain... and one knew from the moment the villain was revealed that they would inevitably have to patch things up by the end of the movie... and so there was no real sense of the villain being truly dangerous or ruthless to the core.

The movie felt predictable and laborsome to watch. I'm not at all fussy and end up loving movies that most tear apart... but this film was forgettable -- they spelled it all out for us and left no mystery to ponder once all was said and done. And even the visual messiness/ madness of the movie was not disturbing or intriguing enough to give me fitful dreams - having gone straight home thereafter and jumped into bed - which I found quite odd. There was nothing truly captivating or gripping about this movie despite the acting being quite decent. No loose ends. Ironically, nothing is left to the imagination.",5

26 November 2022,If I had ADHD this might have been a fun trist.,"There is just too much change to grasp the overall story. Yes, pretty settings, fun characters, great optics. But please stick to something for more than 15 seconds. It have me a major headache. I love to watch complicated plots, and the multiverse is very complicated, but this is loud, hard to follow and not fun. The main characters are not likeable, go not give you reason to care about them, or how they end up. Its a long, loud cacophony of screeching birds that cant sing a pretty or harmonious song. I was trying so hard to engage, but it pushed back on me every moment I watched. What a shame, moms rule, but this was a tragic, epic slog.

24 September 2022,Gimme my money back,"That's some $6.99 I paid Amazon Prime for lost 20 minutes of my life.

I couldn't take it.

Not only it's a weird movie, it's a nonsense bull$hit.

It goes poorly from the beginning, a mixture of English and Mandarin.

Maybe I should have given this a chance.

I don't know.

I switched instead to watching another movie.

And now I have to write 500 characters review for some reason.

Don't waste your money and time with this movie.

What ever people tell, it's not worth it.

I hope my review is not biased and I did not misjudge the movie by its beginning.

Give it a try. You might like it.

Or not.

15 July 2022,Interesting and melodramatic but meaningless,"The philosophy behind the film is clear and can be interesting for many people but the poor execution ends up overshadowing this, it is an almost experimental film, the mix of drama with comedy does not end up making sense or coherence so it does not contribute to the plot. The special effects are the only thing that ends up standing out.

30 July 2022,"I love crazy films, but this one too incoherent","All I can say is, I love crazy films, but this one too incoherent.

It started somehow interesting, after 15 minutes it gets wildy crazy and then it never stops.

To me it felt, as if there was no plot at all. Just a bunch of incoherent wild ideas. Thats not enough to be a cult film.

I am the type of guy, who watches good films again and again over the years. I have seen some 15-20 times over two decades.

There is little or no chance at all, that I will watch this movie again.

19 November 2022,Worst movie i ever seen,"1/10 is too much for it, cause i cant give 0 to it üòÇüòÇüòÇ This movie is literally and totally wast of time üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª The more i say is because it must contain at least six hundred characters , this movie is so bad , i cant explain more than this. How should i put bad and worse in six hundred of characters? Its just so bad.

This movie don't deserve action comedy genre. I expected to laugh a little bit at least. How you can give comedy genre to this movie?

All genre you can give to it is so bad comedy and very very bad action.

Ughhhh i wasted 2 hours of my life seeing this very very very bad movie.

Worth watching it once in your life, at home, for free. After that forget that it is existing. Or not...

One more thing... Eat a bagel for breakfast once in a while.

12 February 2023,"A bitter pill, but not the healthy kind","In general I didn't really enjoy this.

The budget Jackie Chan was my favourite.

My overwhelming feeling from this film is that a cautionary tale about being happy with your lot in life and not wishing for greater things would be far more compelling had it not come directly from a company which makes billions of pounds and doesn't have to live by the rules which everyone else does; not to mention it is portrayed by actors who famously are not happy with their lot in life and eternally strive for greater wealth and notoriety.

But what do I know, I'm just an extra.

The initial notion was good, but the storyline was lazy and poorly delivered.",5
31 May 2022,fighting movie,"I really didn't expect the intensity of the violence in this film or the edgy sexual content; the trailer didn't really suggest this and it caught me off guard. I didn't feel well about halfway through the film: the theater sound was super loud and the violence continuous. Why is everything today blood, guts and sexual torment? No wonder society is so lost.

23 March 2023,Not bad but nothing really new,"I had high expectations for this film, following on from the Oscars. Having just seen it on Amazon prime I must admit I am a feel a bit let down and puzzled by all the hype. The acting and special effects are good, but I don't think it delivers anything really new beyond what we have seen before. The idea of multiple parallel universes stemming from different decisions taken individually is surely not new. A quick Google of ""science fiction multiple universes"" throws up a number of references, some quite old and several with (in my opinion) similar story lines.

Maybe I am mistaken and maybe it's just that I have read books with similar story lines and perhaps they just never made it to film versions. I'm thinking of Andre Norton's The Crossroads of Time, Isaac Asimov's The Gods Themselves. Perhaps more obvious film comparisons would be The Matrix series.

I know it's all a very subjective experience, so all I can say is that, for me, it just didn't deliver. I'm sure others will disagree, as is their right, but I would be surprised if I was the only one feeling a little cheated and let down.",5
31 July 2022,Top10 of lifetime worse movies,"This is probably the worse ""serious"" movie I have ever seen in my lifetime. Completely bizarre, no sense at all, everything mixed with no script, even if you change the editing, it might not affect the final result. Is a waste of time, more than 2 hours. Expendable one!

20 July 2022,I would rather watch kung pow,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.

I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

24 September 2022,Oh please...,"What a waste of my time. I like Michelle Yeoh and for me she was the only good thing in this movie. Was this a work of genius, or a quasi-clever wannabe something? Everyone to decide themselves, I just hope I would not have watched this, as this was the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot...

What puzzles me most is that how is it possible so many people give this movie such high ratings. Surely no-one can honestly say this was a great movie? Someone wrote about the emperor's new clothes. If the movie does not make any sense, is painful to watch and lasts forever, it must be great. Well, it is not.

12 January 2023,Horrible and overrated,"I disliked this movie pretty much from the start. For a movie trying to get across such an important message, this was just not the right way. It was so long and too complex, not for any real cause, that I found myself begging for it to be over.

I did end up liking the ending, as I like the moral of the story, however, most of the rest of the movie was not necessary, poorly developed, or was super cheesy... I mean, I saw the ""villain"" from a mile away and even if I didn't, it just can't get any cheesier than that.

I also appreciate that people in the comments liked the chaos in the movie, but for me, I don't need a movie to give me anxiety.

Bringing consciousness of the open-mindedness is really good point, but this presentation was very bad and boring.

The scenes are constantly exaggerated without any logical sense except representing endless imagination but there was missing an dose of balance and down-to-earth thinking.

18 March 2023,"Different, but kind of funny","This is a very different movie which will have you thinking outside the box. Jamie Lee Curtis is GREAT as is Michelle Yeoh. The other actors are funny and interesting. This movie is quirky. You will probably like it. I don't think it is ""Movie of the Year"" material, but what do I know about what Hollywood likes or approves of?

It has a lot of martial arts and some sexual stuff that may not be suitable for young teens or kids. Best to see this streamed into your home.

It is about love and caring for one another, which is a good thing. Love makes the world go round, at least that is what they want you to think and feel.

12 August 2022,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this film having heard from others how good it was. I was soooo disappointed. It was just a chaotic roller coaster of messy dialogue and mumbled information. I can't believe I wasted over two hours of my life watching this. I gave it 5 stars because the action/stunts were good and Jamie Lee Curtis played her character brilliantly. Actually, I'm amazed that Jamie Lee agreed to appear in this drivel.

19 May 2022,Probably both the best movie and the worst movie I've seen in a long time...,"The Good

I haven't been this gripped by a movie in a long time and I've never seen anything quite like it before. This movie is one of a kind; it's incredibly unique. The production was immaculate and intriguingly strange. Hats off to the director and the actors for making this happen.

The Bad

It could have been little shorter. The movie starts to drag a little bit towards the end but I suppose it makes up for this in the production.

Some people may not like how visual the movie is; I've seen a couple reviews where people called the movie a ""visual assault.""

The Terrible

This is one of the most morally shallow films I've ever seen. I was left incredibly disappointed by the philosophy that the movie was promoting at the end. It wants us to accept nihilism, because we're all just a tiny speck of dust on one of several planets in a universe among many.

According to the movie, nothing matters and we should do whatever we want to do, but we just have to make sure that we include one important action: ""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on."" What???? So nothing matters and we can do whatever we want to do, except that we have to be nice to other people? If nothing matters then what exactly is the point of being nice? There's no reason to do anything in any particular way if we are all just insignificant.

It's as though the movie production was only as immaculate and spectacular as it was just to slyly distract us from the fact that it's promoting nihilism. I think it's reprehensible.

The movie eats itself by trying to pass as ""inclusive"" while simultaneously calling us all insignificant and irrelevant.",5
15 March 2023,"Acting score A+, but D+ for movie","When the trailers first appeared on television, I had no interest in ever seeing this film. Then I watched the March 12, 2023 Academy Awards show. When any movie manages to appear so universally loved and wins so many prizes during the awards season, I figure it's worth a couple of hours of my time. I tried watching it today, but couldn't get through much more than the first hour so far. Then I looked up the full synopsis online, trying to make some sense of what was happening on the screen. Okay, I now get the gist of the story, but the movie is all over the place. It felt like I was watching a spinning disco ball that was covered in Post-Its, each with a little piece of the story, and then had to try to mentally organize them all into something. All I achieved was a headache and some ice strain.

19 January 2023,Disappointed,"Maybe I had very high expectations but I really disappointed.

Many people said that this movie is ""funny"" but I felt embarrassing 13yo American teenage boy humour.

The ""message"" of this movie isn't that unique, very basic Too many ""action scene"" made it boring.

I think people liked it because they can relate to that 'family issues' and maybe that's why they cried. I've seen a lot of reviews that this movie made them cry and I'm a very emotional person but I didn't cry at all.

The movie effects were good tho. Even tho I don't know anything about 'effects', I actually liked it.

Lastly, actors and actresses did very well!",2
19 July 2022,The Matrix fan flick,"Trying too hard to be the Wachowskis by stealing all their ideas, except for bits they lifted from Buckaroo Banzai. Overlong, unoriginal and dumb. It might have been okay as a 90 minute movie, but to pad it out there is repeated scene after repeated scene. An hour in and the plot simply bogs down and never gets going again.

I don't know what else to write to fill up this review because i think that says it all. Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis were excellent. I loved the Deidre character Jamie played, very funny. I also loved the ending of the human relationships ie mother daughter were paramount and should be cherished in the moment. Also being less judgmental of our family and more accepting and loving is truly a practice that leads to happy endings.

27 May 2022,4 is enough!,"If you have seen more films, you will surely consider the level of this film to be average. The interesting parts of this film were struggles, traveling in a parallel world and comedy.

If I had the ability to make a film like this, I would definitely make the best one. Of the two hours of the film, only thirty minutes were useful, the script was strong and the subject matter of the film was interesting.

The actors played well, but the choice of actors for the roles was awful. In this film, more than showing the art of acting, more technological effects were used and it was very imaginative.

And the best part was the concept of living and being together, which was useful.

I am sort of a busy guy and I barely have time to watch movies, however, after seeing the IMDB rate of this movie, I thought, why not? It's been a while I didn't watch a quality movie so let's give it a shot. The bad thing about me is when I start something, I rather finish it to the end and to top that up, I was so devastated at the end of this movie that I told to myself quiet loudly, what have I done to myself and my time? And why people should give it this rate? Absolutely overrated movie in my opinion, no aim, no sense with mediocre acts. I am being generous to rate it 3 and it's only because of the action scenes. I hope no one else with the same working schedule that I have gone through this misery.

Even though I consider that the main characters have a very generous development the movie fails to adhere to the ""Show don't tell"" film mantra. It felt that it needed too much explaining. Other movies with plots as complexed (Inception one of them) required less explanation.

At the end I liked the characters but I believe this story could have been a great sequel to a very good ""cliffhangered"" movie.

Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies).

3 June 2022,Marmite,"There are as many ones as there are ten star ratings for this film. You are advised to keep an open mind and be ready for anything.... And I mean ANYTHING!!!! You will love it or you will hate it but you really should try it.....!

16 January 2023,I'm only giving it a 3 because the actors did a wonderful job.,"But everything else was honestly not it for me. I found it confusing, and slow. The first few scenes were a complete mimic of the Matrix when Neo is in the offices being chased at the very start. I found it was really a combination of many of my favourite movies. From the Matrix to Dr Strange to Any SciFi about universe jumping. Though the performances were fantastic, the storyline was too boring for me, or just not good enough ? We didn't get to experience the other people's lives, we didn't get to experience their world and so it was tough feeling the way that the main actress was suppose to be feeling. While easy to feel the doom of the other characters as we could find ourselves in them. To bring hope, they should have shown more of it.

2 March 2023,Interminable Allness,"I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.

""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?

One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.

Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.

10 April 2023,Would probably rate it higher if not for the oscar,"Sure it had its moments, but all in all it was just too much of what it's titled. Good job by the actors, and really cool that to see the guy who played Data in The Goonies and Shorty in the Indiana Jones movies again.

Mostly I think it's sad that a movie like this is even considered to win an Oscar. Not because awards are so important, but because I guess it shows where the arts are headed. Towards quick rewards, political corectness, and everyone gets a medal at the end. I read a review where someone wrote something about it feeling like a big old messy concoction of tik tok clips, wich I found pretty accurate.

22 May 2022,A hyperactive mess,"Man, I feel like I must be one of the only people who didn't like this movie. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a fitting name for it because that's what this movie throws at you and for me it just didn't work. It's for the most part a tale of finding family across the multiverse which I think could've worked fine on its own. Instead, it's got this scifi ""jumping"" element where in order to switch multiverses you have to do a ""statistically improbable action"". So you go from artsy shots and the protagonist discussing divorce with her husband to some guy sitting on a buttplug in an office or a universe where people have fingers made of hotdogs. I only laughed once or twice during the movie; the overall tone wasn't comedic and the ""wacky"" bits were quite tame compared to what's been done in Rick and Morty to much greater effect. You're also constantly jumping around, martial arts gets thrown in...it's all a bit incoherent.

I would rate Eternal Sunshine higher for emotional time travel, About Time higher for romantic time travel, Rick and Morty higher for comedic time travel, The Butterfly Effect higher for thought-provoking time travel...in summary; this movie is not more than the sum of its parts; it's more like the average of its parts and each part isn't as strong as it could be on its own.

If you like ""trippy"" movies then this might be for you but if you're looking to stay awake for two hours then I'd find something else to watch.",5

13 May 2022,Okay,"I did wonder if we'd been slipped some lsd prior to watching this. It was a little far out in places and i wanted to love it but just didn't. A standard 5 from me however if i were 30 years younger i may have given it a higher rating.

24 June 2022,Good movie made quasi special by jumping on the popular bandwagon,"A 7.3 instead of 8.3 without the usual virtue signalling band wagon every production house is jumping on. How long before people realise movies are for entertainment and not education.

25 January 2023,Overhyped,"This is my first review on IMDB. I couldn't resist. After seeing all the hype and high reviews and the Oscar nomination buzz, I decided to check it out. I managed to get through 45 minutes before I just couldn't take it anymore. I thought it was disjointed and a bunch of nonsense. What are all these critics and reviewers seeing that I'm missing? I watch movies for entertainment and I watch a lot of movies. I might try to watch a bit more to see if I'm missing something, but by 45 minutes in, I would expect to be interested and entertained. So far a waste of time. I guess the lead actors are doing a good job, and Jamie Lee Curtis was certainly in a different role for her, but the story itself needs to make sense.

12 March 2023,Less is More..,"Let me start out by saying, I appreciate movies that are different and out of the norm. So I went in with an open mind. From the very first scene I was excited because I found the characters, very interesting and I was very much invested in the main characters struggles with her day to day life, her family, her business and all the crisis she was facing. So I thought I was going to watch a good movie.....and then the whole other scene unfolded at the IRS office and it took me right out of the movie.

I don't think its a bad movie its just that adding all the other elements was completely unnecessary. Where I think doctor Strange worked better is that the alternate universes tied into the movie in a way that made the movie coherent. What they did in this movie doesn't. It just felt like it was a big, pointless mess. They had everything they needed to make a great story without adding all of the other elements.

Had they just went with the story as it was before the alternate universe scenes, the movie could have been something special. With that being said, I do believe the main two characters deserve a nod for their performances. Otherwise, I just did not find this movie to be watchable let alone oscar worthy.",5
17 October 2022,Purposeless chaos,"Aside from good technical compartment, i enjoyed only a few moments in the entire movie.

The beginning is very underwhelming and a lot of characters are a joke.

Some interpretations make me wonder why people work regular Jobs if someone paid for actors to play a part like this and after filming all giving the final ""yesss it's good we keep this"".

Some comparisons with matrix that i saw really should be deeply thought before placing them close to this movie

And of course since we are in 2022 why don't put in some random ""ye we support lgbtq and stuff""?

Very disappointed, and it's a pity because the originality is there, and so the technical prowess.",4
4 June 2022,Narcissist apologia,"Entertaining but off the mark. Written by a person who doesn't understand themself. Narcissism is caused by lack of genuine parental engagement. Resulting in maladjusted psycho sexual development. It's not that your parents don't like that you're gay, it's that you parents are so self absorbed they don't care at all.

The reason I'm being harsh is. Thee conclusion of the movie is actually harmful. It's maladaptive perfectionism which is common in narcissistic abuse. Most of the movie is what would be the reaction of an abused person. Basically a healthy person would reject the premise and not try to save everyone. You're the unibomber and I'm going to have healthy boundaries even if you're my family.

If you don't believe me the multiverse is what happens when you're abused and your psyche implodes because you're regressing in an attempt to cope with the circumstance. You're living in a narcissists false reality and it's very unhealthy. Self improvement is an individual task and you should remove yourself from narcissists. That's healthy behavior. They're sad destructive people that are black holes. Fun movie bad message.",4
10 July 2022,Make sure you can read the subtitles,"I saw this in Mexico, and was unable to read almost all of the subtitled Mandarin dialog as my Spanish is rudimentary. Also the Mandarin accent was heavy and made some of the English dialog hard to understand. For that reason, the movie ideally should be seen with subtitles that the viewer could easily understand.

For this and other reasons, I didn't understand the plot. I kept wanting for it to end so I could leave with the friends I saw it with. Too long for me. One of them said it was fantastic, the other felt the same as I did.

It's a visual spectacle and looks like what one might experience after having done LOTS of acid.
