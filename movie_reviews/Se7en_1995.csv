14 February 2008,Very grim and disturbing but you can't stop watching,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9
18 May 2010,"A brilliant postmodern film noir that is grim, intelligent and disturbing","From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10
30 April 2004,Dark and disturbing thriller that will stay with you for ever.,"Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a thriller because of that. ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting, or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere. Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive. Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police captain. The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the library scene. Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see. 10/10",10
1 March 2014,Still manages to astound after 20 years of repeat viewings,"After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.

Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.

The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.

When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,"" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.

15 December 2022,An out and out classic.,"A retiring Detective and a young rookie are hunting down a serial killer, a killer with a dark MO, murdering his victims using the seven deadly sins.

As I watch this, it's coming up to its thirtieth anniversary, and it's as fresh now as it was back in 1995, it's an intensely macabre take, crimes that are infinitely macabre and depraved, and intensely twisted.

The combination of Freeman and Pitt is incredible, they work immensely well together, we have the fresh zest of Mills, and the unshakable, but battle weary Somerset. Paltrow and Spacey are excellent in support.

Two hours flashed past, there is no lull, no moment to switch off and boil the kettle, the intensity is immediate, the pacing designed to keep you glued.

I have always thought there is a shade of Alfred Hitchcock about this movie, such is the intelligence of the plot.

Very good visuals, the macabre and gruesome bodies look shocking still, nothing is spared or hidden away.

10/10.",10
15 October 2003,Probably the greatest murder story ever,"Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the ""cops on trail of deranged killer"" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it.

Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.

The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life.

John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.

Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.",10

14 October 2007,one of the best-made films of its era and genre,"Despite clichés, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre.

The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become ""buddies"" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).

There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to ""expect the unexpected"" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.

Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.

I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.",9

20 June 2002,Modern Masterpiece!!,"Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.

David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.

Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.

You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.

David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.

We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.",10
16 August 1999,Superbly crafted drama delves into darkest corners of the psyche,"David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence. With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful ""I'm taking you off the case!"" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear. Despite attempts by studio executives to alter Andrew Kevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiences experienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromising vision.

29 March 2002,Simply one of the darkest and best thrillers of the 1990's  but don't let anyone spoil it for you.....,"`Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man. With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him. However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.

When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise. Yes it wasn't a great film  but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created. Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!

Se7en was his major break through  where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold. The story doesn't sound like much  mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless  the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller. But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable.it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out. From the start we are entombed in mood  the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc. The we begin to find murders  but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest  Genius!

What you don't see is more gory than what you do. Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets betterright up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen. I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.

Freeman is excellent as Somerset  so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc. But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer. Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans  he spends a lot of it looking beaten up. Paltrow is OK with what she has  but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles. R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.

However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters. He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly. In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word. However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.

At heart this is a cop thriller  but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's.",

24 August 2020,"David Fincher Strikes Again, With An Unwavering Thriller That Strikes Straight To The Heart","Pros: 1. The score is beautifully ominous which only deepens the thrilling and unsettling atmosphere. 2. Brad Pitt (Mills), Morgan Freeman (Somerset), and Kevin Spacey (John Doe) give amazing performances. 3. The colour palette being dark and monotone helps to cement the gloomy and grim tone. 4. The gore and practical effects are immense and they still stand up 25 years later. The sloth, lust, and gluttony murders, in particular, stick in mind. 5. The great cinematography knows when to pull the camera back, as well as to draw it close for great effect. 6. Both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have great chemistry together. 7. The back-and-forth between Somerset, Mills, and John Doe in the police car is one of the most intense and captivating scenes in the history of cinema. 8. The movie presents the interesting and complex moral quandary of: is it immoral to kill the immoral? Even if those immoral people adversely affect other people? And who gets to decide who is immoral, and what punishment should be meted out to them? 9. Despite the underdeveloped character of Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), the conclusion is still one of the hardest hitting and iconic endings ever created.

Cons: 1. Tracy is a severely underdeveloped character, with her pregnancy-confessing scene to Somerset feeling lazily forced to add weight to the final scene.",9

24 September 2015,Fincher At His Finest!,"David Fincher has made remarkable films throughout his career, but 'Se7en' finds him at his FINEST! This neo-noir psychological-thriller, is an astonishing piece of Cinema. I was mesmerized.

'Se7en' Synopsis: Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi.

'Se7en' is a Masterstroke from start to end. A dark, moody, violent & utterly gripping story, that keeps you at the edge-of-your-seat. There isn't a single dull moment in this blockbuster, in fact, the tale gets more & more intriguing as it progresses.

Andrew Kevin Walker's Screenplay is Ace. It's a spine-chilling tale about two heroes out to get a psychotic killer. The Writing grips you from the moment it begins & refuses to let you go. Fincher's Direction is incredible. The way he has handled this twisted story, deserves an ovation. Darius Khondji's Cinematography is flawlessly done. Richard Francis-Bruce's Editing is tight. Action-Sequences are mind-blowing. Howard Shore's Score is perfect.

Performance-Wise: Morgan Freeman is at his understated best. The Oscar-Winning Legend delivers a master-class act here, that ranks amongst his finest to date. Brad Pitt is in terrific form, adding depth & anger to his part. Kevin Spacey is loathsome to the core in his creepy portrayal of the wicked villain. Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful in a brief, yet important role.

On the whole, 'Se7en' is a film to die for. Two Big Thumbs Up!",10

15 May 2015,beautiful darkness,"Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a wearied homicide detective. Mills (Brad Pitt) worked hard to transfer to the troubled precinct. He's married to Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). There is a serial killer on the loose delivering his sermon on the Seven Deadly Sins. Somerset is tired of the city. Mills is eager to investigate.

Director David Fincher has filled with beautiful darkness. It's more than just the gruesome murders. It's the rain, the music score and the grungy setting. Fincher has weaved together an artistic masterpiece. Freeman is the perfect grizzled veteran. Brad Pitt is a terrific eager newcomer. There are surprising comedy sprinkled in. The final twist is simply cinematic history. The big line is awesome. Pitt delivers it perfectly with so much heart aching pleading. Some do deride its grotesque gloom but that's like complaining about a movie being too funny or too exciting. This is suppose to be dark and it achieves it.

24 March 2015,Se7en is a Sinfully Enthralling Thriller!,"Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.

Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence – no spoilers here!) is a cliché pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.

It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror.

Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!",10
25 March 2002,"""Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's""","The movie, ""Se7en"", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.

The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.

Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.

Score 10/10",10
20 November 2015,"Dark, grisly, and highly intelligent edge-of-your-seat thriller","David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.

This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.

Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart.",10
13 August 1999,Somerset's World,"Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (""This isn't going to be a happy ending"") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film's final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet's particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).

Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film's astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.

This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)

Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.

This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first.",

13 March 2012,It doesn't get much more influential than this...,"Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.

Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clichéd characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.

For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time.",8

11 June 2012,Atypical ... Disturbing ... Haunting ...,"""Se7en"" is one of these cinematic rarities that elevate themselves to unsuspected levels of depth after each viewing, in the greatest tradition of film noir and detective mysteries. Like ""Chinatown"", it reinvented the noir genre with its own particular atmosphere, both were and are still atypical for their time, and both end with a case solved, yet a puzzling conclusion.

""Se7en"" is less about the series of crimes committed than the two men who lead the investigation, and the way their relationship evolves and highlights their respective approach to life, to death, to the world they live in, with an implicitness that respects our intelligence enough so we can respect the film in return. This intelligence (or subtlety) is not immediately palpable, and the opening scene can mislead some viewers by falsely establishing the sort of odd couple we'd expect in a cop team: the wise veteran and the hot-headed youngster. Of course, you can trust David Fincher's directing and the cleverness of the script because there's much more to say about Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in these two roles, among the best of their careers.

Morgan Freeman is Sommerset, a cop in his last week before retirement but not THE typical cop about to retire, (as a matter of fact, nothing is typical in ""Se7en""), he's a law enforcer who never fired in 34 years of service and never got shot either, quite an achievement for someone who doesn't work in the most secure neighborhood. Sommerset incarnates the typical noir protagonist, whose optimism was eroded by years and years of facing and fighting the most sordid crimes. Although he's not the most likely to have faith in humanity, he's not cynical because he still respects his job. However, he's lucid about one thing, as long as there will be men, there will be rapists, killers, and criminals of the worst species. Sommerset is lucid and competent, he's like a spotlight of hope in a gloomy darkness, and that's enough to gain our respect, he's calm even when facing the most horrific and gruesome crimes, like the poor obese man forced to eat to death.

This opening crime is spectacular and graphic, but Fincher restrains himself because the horror is sometimes more efficient when it's suggested. The horrific aspect of the first crime is also distracted by the first interactions with Mills, Brad Pitt, as the replacing Detective. Mills is not a rookie, he's got his share of thrills and he knows his business. The problem is his temper: too cocky, too hot-headed, too sure of himself, he can't stand Sommerset's patronizing attitude. The progress of the investigation depends on the partnership between Mills and Sommerset, so they do their best to accommodate each other but it's only when Sommerset is invited to dinner by Mills' wife Tracy, that the ice is broken. Tracy here is essential, and not just as a simple plot device, she's a sweet and caring housewife, beautifully played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Tracy loves her husband and provides the extra level of depth needed to appreciate Mills' character who's more one-dimensional in contrast with Sommerset.

Tracy is the emotional connection between the viewers and Mills, and consequently between Mills and Sommerset, she's the heart of the film, and plays like an efficient counterpart to the gloomy atmosphere we're plunged in since the very start, it's no wonder that she 'hates the place', she embodies hope, family, marriage, loyalty, the best in humanity. And that's the most brilliant aspect of ""Se7en"", especially from a 29-year old director: David Fincher, with a remarkable craftsmanship, establishes all the elements of the puzzle in the first half-hour, setting the atmosphere: a rainy, dark and totally unappealing little town. It's a hellish, nightmarish world where we're plunged, where only feeble spotlights can penetrate a nightmarish darkness, it's one of these places, you're afraid to walk like in a dark room where you can accidentally put your foot on a sleeping cockroach. Talk about a hostile atmosphere.

But this atmosphere is perfect because it fits the nature of the crimes committed, and creates the disturbing urge to establish a peaceful relationship between Mills and Sommerset, which coincides with the discovery of the first two murder's links: a fat man is killed by eating, a successful lawyer forced to trade parts of his body to (temporarily) spare his live, two words written in various parts: Gluttony, Greed  an obvious 'to be continued' message to the cops. So, everything leads to the conclusion that the crimes are related to the seven deadly sins, and this time, it's not a killer who kills, but, as states Sommerset: a killer who preaches. But Mills calls a spade a spade, and by labeling the unknown man as 'demented' and 'crazy', he lamentably clouds his judgment while Sommerset is more rational and tries to think like the killer. Mills is all about emotional reactions, Sommerset thinks before he acts, impulses and reason, interestingly, it's the former who believes in love and family, as if 'passion' could work like a double-edged sword.

The atypical nature of the crimes and their author elevate the film, Sommerset goes to library to try to find out hints in Saint-Augustin's books, Dante's Inferno and other medieval and metaphysical classics. Though ""Se7en"" doesn't necessarily go deeper in the subject but it touched them enough to carry a sort of pedagogical value. We might not read all these books after, but I'm sure many of us, would question their approach to some crucial religious notions like faith, forgiveness, innocence and passion. On that level, the film is not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's also a descent into the most hellish aspects of humanity, incarnated by the villain's face, what's more with a perfect conclusion, leaving us with a truly awkward and uncomfortable sensation, free enough to see the half-full or half-empty glass.

Again, ""Se7en"" is a film that respects the viewer's intelligence.",10

28 July 2005,The best Hollywood has produced for a long time,"After the Alien-debacle Fincher proved all the critics wrong. This film is one of the best in a genre that hasn't been very innovative for a long time.

Everyone know's the story by now, so I won't waste time telling it. This film was trend setting with it's dark, gritty look and opening sequence. We still see it copied in movies and TV-series today. Everything is great about this film. I guess if anything, the weakest link in the film is Pitt, who is grossly overshadowed by Freeman. But let's not look for flaws when there really aren't any. The script is intelligent and uncompromising. The direction is innovative en daring. The production-design and cinematography are top-notch.

Fincher is one of the big boys in Tinseltown these days. Seven is the reason why.

4 December 2003,Outstanding Performances / Great Storytelling,"This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film. The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt's supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.

The movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting. There is a ""Pseudo-Noir"" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it's philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.

Andrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes. As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy. In this respect, the film doesn't ""preach"" any special meaning even though the film's moral statements are still maintained. This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.

Outstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****",10
8 July 2005,A must see!!!,"I went to a friends house last night and rented movies. I picked Se7en to rent because I've always wanted to see it since I saw David Fincher's masterpiece, Fight Club and his well made thriller, Panic Room. People have always said this movie was good so I wanted to see it if they were right and they were sure right. Seven is an insanely brilliant film from start to finish. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and especially Brad Pitt are all phenomenal in this chiller. The movie was just plain out suspenseful and left my heart beating fast til the movie was done. The twist at the end was very intense and you never knew it was coming. Totally unpredictable. Overall, a fantastic film and David Fincher is a pure genius when it comes to smart films and Se7en deserves to be one of the greatest thrillers that has ever been made. I highly recommend it.

16 June 2005,Se7en,"'He is preaching.punishing'.

Serial killing with clues from killer is not a new thing to Hollywood but David Fincher's Se7en exceptional. Its evil genius. Se7en opens with a homicide where a fatso is killed in a very strange manner. We meet Detective Somerset(Freeman) who is about to take off and detective David Mills(Pitt) has just fought to get assigned there. Somerset is calm, mature and has achieved mastery over his job. He probably seen so much that now he badly wants to go far away from this bloodshed. David appears cocky first but turns out amiable character of the film. Tracey(Palthow) is David's wife who hasn't got used to with guns even after so many years of their marriage.

It begins. Each killing is shockingly repellent. Like an artist's signature every victim holds a note, a sin highlighted with lines from Dante Alighieri' s 'Divine Comedy', Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice'. And his name is John Doe(Kevin Spacey). Those lines are screaming that this not just some insanity. He wants to make a point.

Each murder is done by reaching horrific extremes of those deadly sins. A fat man is fed until he burst. Then there is an infamous lawyer got gun stuck on his head, handed a knife -a weighing scale is in front of him and he has to cut 1 pound of flesh from his body by himself. A druggist tied to bed for a whole year!! A famous model, her nose is cut and bandaged again and gave a choice- phone in one hand to call help n sleeping pills in other one to die rather than live deformed. A whore is punished ruthlessly that you should see on screen only. John says, ""The world is so shittyand we get used to them"".

This Script is sumptuous. It mirrors today's society skillfully and boldly. Nothing is hidden by the camera. All we watch is naked truth that we hate to admit and most of the time that we hardly care. The spirituality woven in has its impact all over. Most of all ending is a blow. It is stunning.

There are number of memorable sequences in Seven. One especially is breath-taking when Somerset and Mills reaches John doe's apartment and Doe directly starts shooting at them and chase sequence followed is absolute fabulous. On other hand dinner party at Mills house we feel wine mixed in the air. Tracey and Somerset's meeting at coffee shop is the finest ones I ever seen. The intensity of that conversation can't be described.

This is a very dark film. It is all time raining. All environment surrounding Se7en is so grim and ghastly it clouds viewers with the same. Music refuse to leave us even when it is over. I must mention titles and credits rolled, one of the best I ever seen.

Se7en comes out with strong performances. Morgan Freeman is truly outstanding. Brad Pitt made me his fan from this movie. The way he says ""Ladies and Gentleman we have a homicide here"" and same David when taunted by Somerset ""You are saying you care for these people?"" says with assuring impulse ""Sure I do.!!!"". Gwyneth Paltrow 's Tracey doesn't have much screen presence but when she is there, we just can not stop love her character. In final half an hour we are introduced to Kevin Spacey's John Doe. The preacher. What can I say about this chilling work? Spacey gave such a performance that stings. We hate to admit with this man but somewhere we know he is right. Somerset asks him, ""So you are saying some higher power tell you to do this?"" Just watch John Doe reply ""Lord works in mysterious ways.."". Interesting thing pointed out by one of the fan is Somerset and John Doe both observed the same facts about today's society but responds in different ways, Somerset want to run away and Doe takes action.

No matter how many thrillers I shall see but this will always one of my favorites. It affects deeply. That's the power of Se7en. Se7en is a terrific thriller and a modern classic.",8
2 April 2011,So so,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

11 August 2021,Strong movie,"This movie is meant to shock the viewer. It is a statement on human society that is even more true now than it was 26 years ago when the movie came out. Whether you agree or not, whether you're shocked or not, it is a good strong movie with a great cast. Highly recommended.

20 January 2015,"Very well made, but....","I think the audience for ""Se7en"" is rather self-selecting. If you don't mind an ultra-gory cop film with a lot of expletives, then you will be delighted. If you are looking for something family-friendly or 'nice', then you wouldn't even consider watching this in the first place. While I don't think I'd put myself in either group, I am not really a bit fan of gore and although I can respect the film, it really isn't a film for me. So why did I watch it? Well, with well over 17000 reviews and an overall IMDb score that places it near the top of all films, then it's natural I'd get to it sooner or later.

As for the film, I won't say much--there are already TONS of reviews for this one. Suffice to say that the plot is exceptional--complex, shocking and worth seeing. The acting also is quite nice all around. The bottom line is that this IS a quality production and if it's the sort of thing you'd normally watch, watch away and enjoy.

3 October 2005,"It cuts and slices away, but still follows police-movie formula...","Is Morgan Freeman our greatest living actor? He may in fact be, and his mere presence here (solid, noble, and pure) is reassuring, but even Freeman can't overcome the usual cat-&-mouse/killer-toying-with-detectives stew that ""Se7en"" serves up. There's a serial killer loose in rainy New York City, and as he mounts his seven grisly crime scenes--modeled after the Seven Deadly Sins--he quickly becomes aware of the two homicide detectives on the case and is enamored of their drive and determination. Most of this is left vague and unexplained; we learn precious little about the psychopath involved except that he's highly literate, educated, with too much strict religion in his background. This is all hoary police-movie fodder, as is the set-up with the detectives: the wise codger about to retire and his cocky new partner with the short fuse. The film mounts the tension well, with staccato glimpses of corpses and gore, but can't escape a fatigued sense of deja vu (I thought mostly of ""The Silence of the Lambs""). Brad Pitt gets off to an awkward, hesitant start in his role, but does improve. Freeman is sensational; whether throwing his knife at a dartboard or studying up on literature at the library, he is focused and gripping. The grimy, lust-and-death soaked atmosphere is wallowed in (it's the Big Apple as a Gothic Hell), and certainly it is palpable and captured successfully, but completely off-putting. Words written in blood on the walls...it's too much like real-life crime scenes, and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker isn't clever enough to distract us or cunning enough to help us distinguish the difference (the killer does leave clues, but they are quickly solved). The narrative is a mix of derivative movie-thriller ideas and new-fangled ways of making the viewer as squeamish as possible--it's the old pulling-wings-off-flies number, but on a larger sick-making scale. The film is predictably gruesome, less predictably formula-bound. **1/2 from ****",6

13 April 2001,The Best of its Kind,"Seven is by far one of the best serial killer movies ever made. This movie has a great premise, fantastic actors, great direction by David Fincher, and a fantastic gritty atmosphere.

The story centers around 2 dectectives, both going down seperate paths. Det.omerset(Morgan Freeman) is heading toward retairment while Detective Mills(Brad Pitt)is just starting out his career. He's full of energy and opinions. Soon the both are on the msot disturbing case they have ever come across. A serial killer is killing his victims based on the seven deadly sins(Gluttony, Sloth, Wrath, Lust, Greed, Envy. The killer is very smart and the two detectives soon realize that he is using them as a pawn to complete his masterpiece.

The acting in this film is amazing. Morgan Freeman turns in a great performance. very subtle, yet commanding. He's like a wise-man spreading his knowledge to others. Brad Pitt is also very good in a more energetic performance. His character is pretty unlikable but he does have a certain charm. Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused but she is still very good. She's one of the only bright spots in this othe wise dark film. The killer, who's identity i won't give away here is avery effective in his small amount of screen time. He gives a very creepy performance that will leave a lasting impression.

Another thing this film has going for it is style. David Fincher has put together a film with a fascinating atmosphere. It's very dark and it sets th tone for the film.

I suggest you go out and rent this film if you haven't seen it. Also for fans of the film the 2 disc dvd is a must have.",9
26 May 2017,One of the best films ever made,"""Se7en"" (1995) is a true masterpiece. I have seen this film like a thousand times and every time I watch it again it's as disturbing as the first time. It's always intriguing from start till finish. This is one of the best stories ever told on screen. 10/10 for this motion picture, it's a true art. A must watch.

14 November 2009,just how I like'em,"Thrillers are either a hit or a miss. They can be awesome while many can be awful. Seven is in the Very awesome category. Basing the film around the seven deadly sins is an concept that everyone can relate too. We have all sinned meaning we can be put ourselves in the shoes of the victims ( not all victims mind you ) . When you imagine a film in which it always cloudy and overcast with rain pouring down 24/7 , you would think it going to depress you . Truth is , you don't actually notice the weather , but instead take huge interest on what happening in the homes of the city.

I'm not an huge fan of Brad Pitt but it seems that when he teams up with Fincher , he always puts on an good performance. Then there's Morgan Freeman, which is fairness, is playing Morgan Freeman. He fun to watch but you know what type of performance he going to act out. Both are very good but the one who steals it is Kevin Spacey. He may be in it for 20 minutes, but his role is extremely memorable. His character is well made and maybe deserves a bit more screen time . The film is very well made and an joy to watch. It keeps you awake and leaves you to wonder about the next deadly sin. When watching it, you can clearly see that Seven was an influence towards Leigh Whannell and James Wan and there SAW film. Everything about SEVEN was great, the concept, the acting, the finale. I highly recommend this film.",8
9 March 2010,Almost Too Much to Bear,"I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors. I missed this the first time through and wanted it to be part of my movie-going experience. I don't think I could ever watch it again.

2 March 2008,"Gritty, Disturbing Thriller - One of its Kind","Incredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that one might describe David Fincher's Seven, a film, as all of these reviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing people based on the seven deadly sins. There is little need to rehash the plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the best thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key performances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New York police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the other is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between them and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any role he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R. Lee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice and looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David Fincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a very seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with the crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting effects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of characterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is well-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable. The film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so - they succeed. But behind all that blood and seedy atmosphere lies a chess game between two police detectives - each good at what he does in a different manner - and one crazy but brilliant sociopath killer. The journey they take us on is one scary ride.",9

11 November 2006,The Good & Bad Of 'Se7en',"I am shocked that I watch, much less own, this movie, and as often as I do. It's so dark, so uncomfortable to watch in many spots and so profane (although I use a TV Guardian) that it's not a very likable story and film.....but I find it fascinating. Let's continue on with the bad, and the good, of this film - at least from my vantage point.

THE BAD - As a Christian, I get tired of seeing the villains, the sickest of serial killers, portrayed as Christians. It's unbelievable Hollywood bias that would never be tolerated if minorities were the constant victim of this kind of prejudice. In case, you don't get the message they even pass by a brightly-lit neon cross in the guy's room! That, and another cheap shot about a Southern Baptist being the killer, and comments about the sicko ""preaching a sermon"" plus Kevin Spacey's talks about people's sins....all are designed to portray a sick killer as a religious nutcase. Also, for further Liberal slants, good-guy Morgan Freeman is talking to Gywneth Paltrow at a neighborhood diner and he relates having talked an old girlfriend into having an abortion which Freeman says, ""to this day, I am positive it was the right move."" Yet, he also says it was a mistake and he regrets it. Huh?? Other negatives include too many f-words and usages of the Lord's name in vain, mos of them said by Brad Pitt. There are also several really, really downright gross scenes in here. If you don't expect them, you can easily be shocked with these disturbing images: some very sick pictures of tortured and mutilated bodies.

THE GOOD - Despite all of the above, the story - as shocking and sordid as it is - is a fascinating one. It gets you so involved that it's almost impossible to put down, even with the unpleasant scenes. The finale is memorable, too. I also appreciated the wonderful cinematography in here. There are some strange colors in here but it all looks fantastic on the special-edition DVD. Spacey was relative unknown in his acting career at this time was riveting in that final 30 minutes when he had his speaking lines. All the actors in here are excellent. This is a film that is impossible to forget.

OVERALL - As a friend once told me, ""This movie is very disturbing."" It's also extremely interesting, but beware it's not easy to watch.",8

5 March 2020,Extremely overrated,"I don't really understand the hype over this movie, it has a good cast and it is a good movie but it's different to be good and to be one of the greatest and this movie has nothing that makes it one of the greatest. The only interesting thing here is that the killer uses the seven deadly sins but even this premise could've been better used, the plot twist is kinda shocking but isn't one of the best ones, ain't one of those jaw dropping ones, at least not for me. The actors did normal nothing especial here too. I love movies of this kind but I got bored watching this and is really nothing special about it, just a massive disappointment

11 May 2005,oh yeah!,"Se7en is great. Need I go on? Alright... Se7en starts off nicely making it look like another day at work. Well it is, but it's the beginning of something big. Not 5min into the movie and we're introduced to the first murder scene which is a obese man with his hands tied together under the table and his face smashed into a pile of noodles. He's obviously dead. The killer in this movie picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins, which if you don't know are: greed, gluttony, lust, pride, wrath, envy, and sloth. The killer is very original in the style he kills his victims, which are often times very gruesome. Although they don't really show any killings in here just the way they implied lust was enough to turn my stomach. The movie does a great job with its dark setting and bad neighborhood. Symbolic that this city sucks and is run down. The acting by Mordan Freeman and Brad Pitt is sensational, as well as Kevin Spacy's acting, whom I praise for his role. Overall this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the ending... oh buddy, the ending will getcha.

10 October 2008,"Yeah, a landlord's dream: a paralyzed tenant with no tongue.","There is no one who could argue against the fact that if you put Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey together in a film, it is going to be a hit.

I have watched countless hours of murder mysteries in movies and TV and have read innumerable books, and there is no finer murder/serial killer story than this one.

It has every element that one would look for in this type of story and it delivers with a punch to the gut that is visceral and lasting.

This is one of those films that you can watch countless times and never tire of.

11 July 2016,"A huge thriller, although visually disturbing to the faint hearted.","In this film, two detectives have to work together in order to catch a psychopathic killer obsessed with the Seven Sins. Directed by David Fincher, with a script by Andrew Kevin Walker, this film has Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as protagonists.

This film approaches, several times, the grotesque. Its far from appealing to everyone but it will, almost certainly, please any fan of thrillers or police movies. The killer is a madman who seems obsessed with a naturally awkward topic: the Seven Deadly Sins, well known to anyone who has attended Sunday School. The film never speaks openly of religion, but we deduce that this crazy killer is probably Christian, which may displease the practitioners of that faith and even Catholics. In fact, religious fanaticism is quite implicit in the history, and the scenery. Like it or not, its an excellent idea for a movie and gave rise to a great plot, capable of holding the public until the end, despite several disgusting scenes, able to make any popcorn-eater throw in the bag. Yes, this is an alert for the teenagers and the faint hearted: this film is, indeed, visually shocking.

The way the main characters were developed is very reasonable. They are two detectives, very different personally and professionally, almost the antithesis of each other until they need to form a true partnership. Brad Pitt gives life to a young cop, active, impulsive, passionate, naturally clashing against the thoughtful and prudent manners of the character played by Morgan Freeman, who only want to do the job well done and go home at the end of the day... until he understands (and he does it quickly) that this killer will not stop easily and is different from anything they thought before. The work of the actors is good, especially Freeman, who incorporate his character easily. Pitt also shone, but his character it's hard to like up to half of the film.

The film is exceptionally heavy. The picture is dark, most of the scenes takes place in low light or at night (the most notable exception is the police station, plenty of bright and light colors). The crime scenes are usually dark and have black elements (in one of them is the furniture, for example). There are religious elements evident throughout the film also. The soundtrack is interesting, contributing decisively to densify the tension with the constant repetition of high and long chords.

In short, this movie is deep, psychologically challenging, shocking and promises to leave no one indifferent. A great story of suspense, from start to finish.",9
15 July 2016,"Complete and Utter Suspense,","Se7en is an amazing movie with an incredibly well developed plot and a stunning cast. It had me glued to the screen for the entire run time, as we follow two detectives struggling to catch a serial killer who has been murdering people as a representation of the seven deadly sins, the images this killer makes the bodies in to are literally some of the most brutal things I have witnessed on film. David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker did a stellar job developing detectives Somerset and Mills, who Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt bring to life flawlessly, their relationship is a complicated one that becomes more layered as the film continues. However, the highlight was Kevin Spacey, who steals the show as the man we were waiting to see from the very beginning, and is not one bit disappointing, he is sinister, absurd and a straight up creep, he chilled me to the core, I do not think any other actor could have portrayed this psychopath better. Thrilling, engaging and incredibly well acted, I can not find a single flaw in Se7en, highly recommend to anyone looking for a good mystery or thriller.

Two detectives search for a serial killer who plans on taking seven victims as a way of exposing the deadly sins.

Best Performance: Kevin Spacey",10
13 December 2004,"""Seven"" or ""Four point five?""","There is no doubt ""Seven"" is a superior film in every way, so far as crime dramas/psychological dramas go, Fincher is indeed a visionary director. This film however has achieved an unrealistic and totally unsupportable ""aura"" of brilliance that is simply unjustified. Having seen it now five times, the latest last night after my son bought it for my birthday, I have to declare it to be as boring and pretentious as the first night I saw it.

Without anything but praise for everyone's performance (Spacey, especially) I still have nothing but blank indifference to every character presented here. What in Zeus' butthole was the point of the film? Any half competent lawyer would have gotten Pitt a suspended sentence (justifiable homicide...temporary insanity..whatever) Who cares what the hell Freeman decided to do...hang around a few more years, go shoot a few chickens? As for Ms Paltrow - the most boring and one-dimensional actress yet paraded on the silver screen (though Nicole Kidman isn't far behind)...HER fate was the highlight of the movie.

Shamelessly exploitive crap though it was, I found RESURRECTION (A ""Seven"" clone) way more interesting and given that starred Mr ""Wooden"" himself (Christopher Lambert)....maybe I need therapy.

Quite frankly for all its social comment, upmarket direction, cinematography and set-design, I think ""Seven"" is a modern ""Kings New Clothes."" Great film....shame about the entertainment factor. ANY film that feels like you've just donated four hours of your life has at its core, a problem.

As for those who even MENTION this in the same breath as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - you HAVE to be kidding! That sequence between Hannibal and Starling during their first meeting alone, blows everything this film has to offer out the window.",
20 April 2017,Brilliant,"This is an excellent serial killer thriller.

Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play police detectives who together are tracking a serial killer who kills people who have each committed one of the seven deadly sins in a way that's relevant to the specific sin. Kevin Spacey plays the killer.

13 August 2022,A 90s Masterpiece.,"Seven is the first time we ever really experienced Fincher (Alien 3 doesn't count!!). Great performances by a young Brad Pitt and the always reliable Morgan Freeman. Freeman is the highlight here and he should have gotten some awards consideration for Seven.

Fantastic look and thriller story and one of the most talked about ending a of all time!! Highly recommend and watch at night to increase the the feel.

19 December 2014,Urban decay has never been so slickly photographed.,"Se7en is one of those films you watch in between long intervals. For me, this was my third rewatch and my last. I don't think I have the stomach for another.

It is essentially a buddy cop flick, but the script touches on deeper issues of the future of human society, sin, apathy, and predestination. The Noir trappings are beautiful to behold, the constant rain, squalor, grimy city that feels like every dystopian metropolis combined into one. But it occasionally veers into fantasy with a plot that relies on a few too many gimmicks to make it flawless. The villain is simply an omnipotent being at times with almost magic powers.

There are moments of genuine humanity that doesn't make it completely hopeless, but the atmosphere is filled with so much despair and nihilism that the grunge attitude of it does begin to wear as the clock ticks by. And by the time the villain of the piece makes his grand entry, I kept expecting him to appear with a leather mask on his face and gloating evilly about eating a census taker's liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti.

Still, the dynamic between Freeman and Pitt is still enticing to watch, and the story works as a parable or even sadistic fable at a rudimentary level. But sometimes I wish the story hadn't been so manipulative and fixed just so that it could punish these characters and push them to insane lengths. I felt like character motivations and development were being engaged at the behest of the plot progression, so certain events begin to seem contrived just so it can reach the shocking conclusion. I assume the writer was trying to teach a lesson, albeit in a clumsy fashion.

I would call it a minor 90s classic, and the dreamlike, twilight zone-esque environment adds a nice surreal atmosphere. For those willing to ignore plot conveniences and the dingy weather, this film will take you along for a horrific trip into the darkest recesses of what men are capable of.",8
14 October 2012,Terrific thriller!!!,"This movie was just awesome.A thriller that really leaves you on the edge of your seat the whole time your watching. It starts morgan freeman who always does a superb job, accompanied by brad pitt who always did an outstanding job. And to top it all off it was directed by David Fincher who has made some great movies.

This movie is about two detectives (Freeman,Pitt) who are sent to invesitage a weird string of murders. There is a murderer killing people using the seven deadly sins as justification.

Overall this movie was really good. Great actors, great story line and a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested. I really liked it.

19 October 2007,"Perfect and consistent theme, amazing cast....","This film has many indelible moments, an amazing cast: Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset is impressive and real. The Charlie Parker soundtrack with the blues sung by Billie Holiday ""I Cover the Waterfront"" captures the dark mood and underlying violence which exists in the city. Being from New York, the street scenes at night are 100% accurate, executives, harried workers, hookers and dealers all intermingle in a pastiche of chaos.

We see the early scene where Freeman first meets novice detective David Mills (well portrayed by Brad Pitt) and he asks him what NYC homicide is like, and won't agent Somerset regret retiring? Freeman answers tiredly ...""I am moving....anyplace...far away from here""...

Sloth, Greed, Lust, Pride, Envy, Gluttony, the seven deadly sins as proclaimed since Medieval era. Each murder is precisely carried out. John Doe is creating his masterpiece, an artwork of perfect murder. Kevin Spacey is superb as John Doe. His presence and diction are cutting and menacing. I would love to see him in more of these roles. The quote from Morgan Freeman at the end of it all resounds true: it is the quote from Hemingway. The theme is ""ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee""....Everyone is affected by violence. Best thriller and suspense, other than Hitchcock. Kudos to David Fincher and the cast The screenplay is amazing, I have bought that as well as the DVD. Highly recommended. 10/10.",10
15 October 1999,In a word-Drek,"You are in for a real treat here film fans: endless scenes of torture, abuse, bondage, a beheading, rape; assault...body functions, the human condition as a Butcher block, if you will.

Nothing in this movie makes me want to see it again-Morgan Freeman was better in the Electric Company; for Pete's sake, than he was here-and for Brad Pitt....he looks like he was mad at his agent for making him be there. Kevin Spacey is okay but so what? He was much better in Usual Suspects and the Negotiator. Gwyneth Paltrow as always seems vaguely emaciated, and the main co-star, the smothering rain-was as much in the way as anything else.

Don't go see this unless you have always wanted to know what the cause of a Scripted Barfing marathon looks like. Personally I can't imagine why dreck like this and Hannibal Lector keep on getting made; Hollywood must be wanting to reach the Jeffrey Dahmer/John Wayne Gacy demographic more.

Rating? ** outta ****; I hated this one-belongs in the goat bin.",
13 June 2016,"""It seems that envy is my sin.""","Seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,John Doe (Kevin Spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. The story begins with Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place. This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.This is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a ""Hollywood"" style ending. ""Seven"" is symbolic of several things in this film: Of course, the seven deadly sins (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, Wrath) are the killer's inspiration; Somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.

Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Mills' wife Tracey, and there is a certain sadness to her character, something she reveals to Somerset one day while they are having breakfast in a diner. Even though her role is not one that is major throughout this movie, she is a crucial element that plays itself out in the climax of the film. One of the most haunting ironies I find in Walker's script well portrayed by Fincher's cast is the uncanny similarities between John Doe, the antagonist and Somerset, the protagonist. If you watch that one scene in the car, you will realize that Somerset agrees with Doe, yet although realizing that their consensus does not justify Doe's irrational, yet seemingly rational killings. With Doe's philosophy explaining his intolerance for the prevalence and trivialization of the deadly sins, Somerset's continuous argument that we are becoming too apathetic of a society, only motivated by such things such as our temptations and self-indulgence, there is admittedly a strong parallel that exists between the two characters. Yet, they stand opposed to one another, because while Somerset, although discouraged, managed to keep his faith in mankind, Doe did not, and could not tolerate the injustice any longer. The film has some gory and graphic scenes that might turn some weak stomachs, but it has everything you'd want from a thriller: mystery, suspense, a great plot, great acting and a great, shocking and surprising ending.

Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9
3 March 2017,One Of The Best Dark/Suspense/Horror/Crime Movie Out There.,"My Personal Rating - 8.5/10 - This Film is also great the acting the atmosphere is good. especially the ending, i won't spoil anything, just watch this film if you love suspense, mystery, a little bit horror in my opinion. and as always this film might not be for everyone obviously it's no mickey mouse kinda movie that a kid can watch. it's dark.

30 September 2022,Solid,"Took a look at this again after 27 years. While the whopper of an ending has stuck with me, I recalled little else other than that I wasn't super impressed by this back then and I think a lot of that had to do with my then not very high opinion of Brad Pitt. It's a well made, unusual, sometimes gruesome serial killer crime story about with a solid performance from Morgan Freeman. I always had a problem with Pitt when he was young in that I didn't think he was all that great of an actor. I still have some issues with him here, but he's better than I remembered and has some moments that are interesting. This was a big year for Kevin Spacey with this and The Usual Suspects, but it's hard to look at him now in this creepy role that he plays so perfectly. Seems a lot of people on here love this good movie.

10 November 2019,I am just speechless after watching thus movie.,"The theme of the movie is so dark that at certain points in the movieI felt like stop watching this one but its way of narration and the suspense does'nt let me do so. David Fincher has made this master piece in such a way the it will not make you feel boarded at all . The ending of the movies was the best as well as the darkest part of the movie which revolves in the viewers mind even after the move ends. Its one of the best Drama/Mystery movie I have seen. Overall this movie is outstandingly brilliant.

10 December 2015,"Bleak, suspenseful, yet intriguing","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",8
23 July 2004,One of the 90's best movies!,"David Fincher has become one of Hollywood's most wanted directors since this film and this is a fantastic film. Since this he hasn't done a bad film, in fact most are excellent. Seven is more conventional than his films the Game and Fight Club but it has a great script which is fantastically directed. The actors of the film are of the highest calibre. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwynith Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are all fantastic, Freeman and Spacey in particular. The film has plenty of twists and is involving while everything comes to a shocking and stomach churning ending. This is definitely one of the best crime thrillers ever made.

As with other Fincher movies it looks fantastic. The cinematography is outstanding. The score is also fantastic and the overall look and sound of the film is top class. This is a modern classic, no doubt. *****

12 March 2015,The Rainy City Holds A Lot Of Secrets,"Wow, here is the thing, most movies that have been out for a long time and I have been told that are great but have not got a chance to see yet, well, most of the time they never live up to the hype. That is not the case with Se7en. This is one amazing movie. The acting was stellar, directing was spot on and the use of the city and rain added so much atmosphere that it was almost another character in the film. I did see the end coming even though I was hoping that I was wrong.(I think I knew what was coming not because this movie was predictable, more so that after this movie lots of movies and TV shows have stolen from it, so it kind of easy to see where it was going, I am sure if I had seen this when it was first out I would have been surprised) This is a five star movie that I think will still be great 50 years from now. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review. http://youtu.be/WCVDBOziSrM

Se7en is the story of a serial killer, who kills his victims for the seven deadly sins. Two homicide detectives join their hands for the investigation. It is the last case of a retiring officer, Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the first case of Mills (Brad Pitt).

Not writing more about, in case if anyone has not seen yet.

Great direction supported by amazing visuals make this movie a worth watch.

24 March 2023,Best movie ever seen in my life 100/10. Beats everything today in 2023 aswell.,"WOW. Thats how to describe this movie.

Now whoever put Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman deserves a medal for life because they created the BEST DUO OUT. The story is so well written, the movie has your interest the entire time, I can watch this for the rest of my life and never be bored of it. Everybody involved in this movie needs an oscar each, it is just a history record breaker of being the greatest movie ever made of all time. Every actor, scene, suspense, plot, story in this makes it the movie it still is today. It is so hard to reach this high of a level of a movie nowadays, just an incredible watch. Thanks to all for creating this gem!

27 January 2006,"Okay, but a bit overrated IMO","Maybe I've just seen too many movies. Maybe my expectations were too high, having seen this movie highly praised here. Maybe the story seemed a bit too predictable to me. Maybe I just found some of the gore a bit over the top. Or maybe I've seen so much gore in films already that I simply wasn't that impressed.

Whatever it was, this movie struck me as okay, certainly not bad, but not the masterpiece others have praised it as. Interestingly, I've seen most of the main characters in movies that I liked better: Kevin Spacey appeared in The Usual Suspects; Brad Pitt in Twelve Monkeys (although he also did a fine job here); and Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy and The Shawshank Redemption.

11 July 2015,Sinners are not Saints,"Those who try to punish Sinners are not Saints either of course. The movie who was showing people things that are going wrong with our society, is a showcase of Brad Pitt. Putting Morgan Freeman next to him was working more than fine. But it's the mystery surrounding the who is behind it all.

The journey we take, with a conclusion that will leave you devastated (even those who knew or were able to see where it was going) to say the least. Fincher is showing he knows how to direct, edit and set the mood for a film. This is as assured as it gets and one of the best thrillers the 90s produced for the movie business. I won't go into the story, but if you like suspense, you will be more than happy to watch this (some scenes are tough to watch mind you!)

23 March 2022,detective thriller masterpiece,"Let's start with the basics. Which, in this movie, aren't as simple as the term implies. There is mystery to be had, thrills to experience, chills down your spine, the wrinkling of your nose in disgust, the unease in your gut, and oh yes, even a handful of chuckles. Mostly thanks to the dark humor and sarcastic manner of Brad Pitt's character, while Morgan Freeman's is the much more solemn, except that one scene where he's laughing more than I've ever seen him laugh in any other movie. Their polar opposites help engage different parts of your brain, and emotions, as the movie progresses. It's a rollercoaster of sorts, but mostly stays in the ballpark of disturbing this after disturbing that, yet all the while you're immersed in the bleak atmosphere, you're simultaneously glued to the screen. The score is haunting, the cinematography just - I don't know the word, I just love it - and the performances superb from one character to the other. Aside from the main two stars, all the supporting roles throughout execute so naturally that half the time it feels like a sordid documentary. Then of course there's Kevin Spacey, in a notorious role that was a shocker to people watching it for the first time. Given that I only write spoilerless reviews, I won't touch on the details of what I consider one of if not my favorite movie ending of all time. Back to the beginning, I love that the movie opens with a scene, and then runs the credit sequence, which is unnervingly perfect in itself, and from there the movie proceeds. Sure, it has some slow moments, but to be expected, and ultimately I am still too enrapt to have any of that detract from my rating. Even though the movie strictly follows the detective side of things versus the actual murders, the riddles and intrigue suffice to keep you far from bored.",10
8 September 2016,Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.,"Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.

Engaging right from the word go, and shocking at the end, this film is an epitome of writing and shows that if a well-written script is directed well, then everything becomes great. David Fincher was not a great well-known when he was making this. His first film Alien 3 was supposedly panned by most people. Then, he took on directing this cold blooded murder mystery film, and boy he did the job extremely well.

The dialogues are extremely important and they have a lot of weight. It's rare to see a thriller filled with such nuances and have a deep meaning to words. The action is minimal and yet has a very high impact. The culmination or finale is a shocker. To say the least, the last 30 minutes are riveting and spine chilling.

The nearly 130 minutes film becomes highly action packed after 90 minutes. In the last 40 minutes, actually, there is a lot of dialogue that's very provocative than action. Yet. it's so very engaging that it takes me to the edge of seat each time I see this film thus, I call it as action-packed. I must say, I have seen this film multiple times, with multiple people as my viewing partners, and each time I like it more. So this film just keeps growing on me.

The cinematography is amazing and so is the editing. These two departments technically are supreme. Other departments did their job well too. Of all, it's the direction that mattered. Fincher gave us a glimpse what he is capable of with this supreme film, his next one was ""The Fight Club"" which is a cult in itself.

It's a 5/5 for a great film that surpasses time to stand out as a classic thriller. I have not named the actual supreme character in this film, so go and find out who it is and what he does.",10
30 August 2015,One of the best crime thrillers ever made,"This is one of the most horrifying movies ever made. But it doesn't just consist of violence. It has amazing performances, tense scenes, and a nail-biting finale which you won't ever forget for a very long time.

2 detectives try to hunt down a psychopath as he kills people in grotesque ways based around the seven deadly sins.

This movie contains several memorable scenes which have the tendency to knock you off guard. Besides the ending, another amazing scene is when they investigate the sloth victim. The gore is amazing but we get the jumpscare of our lives in it. I'm not going to spoil it though because otherwise I'll ruin it. Many people will agree that the ending is the best part by far. It is tense and suspenseful and it is completely unpredictable. It is one of the most memorable movie endings by far.

Also, the acting is amazing also. In my opinion, Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt both give one of their best performances yet. Morgan Freeman's also gives as amazing performance and it is rivaled only by his performance in The Shawshank Redemption.

The acting worked real well because this movie did a great job with its choice of casting. Fincher probably looked at previous works of Freeman, Pitt, and Spacey's roles and he knew that they would be perfect for these roles and his casting choices really paid off.

As much I want to give this movie a 10, there are a few scenes which I felt carried on a bit too long or were more slower-paced than the rest of the movie. There weren't too much that bothered me too an extensive degree though. However, I do think that this would've been a masterpiece if it weren't for those few scenes.

Nobody thought much of Fincher when he directed Alien 3 and he was originally dismissed as just another style over substance director. However, he looked at the mistakes that movie made and he showed moviegoers with this movie that he is a talented director. Since then, he has made several more amazing movies (especially Fight Club) and he is now one of the more appreciated directors working today.

In conclusion, Se7en is a near perfect movie. Sure, the pacing can be a bit slow at times but this is still an amazing crime drama and I think that this is one of the best crime movies ever made. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time and it contains one of the best finales to a movie ever. I understand why some people disliked this movie but none of the reasons affect my opinion of this movie and I think that it is a must-watch for everyone as long as you don't mind realistic violence and gore.",8

The performances are incredible. Before Kevin Spacey's behavior got him ""canceled"" by emerging societal trends, he proved himself with films like this one that's a generational actor.

Pitt and Freeman also deliver elite performances in a film that's thrilling, mysterious, and ultimately in the Pantheon among the greats.

22 March 2017,"It's great, but you'll want to jump in the shower after it's done","This is exactly why I hold fast to the idea of a second look, particularly when it comes to movies. ""Seven"" is Exhibit A, and what I'd remembered about it over the last twenty-odd years was the mindscrew ending - as well as the omnipresent rain and dingy interiors, a world I don't want to stick around in.

But within that hopeless environment is a deeply unnerving thriller and even a good cop drama. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well-defined characters; theirs is an abrasive relationship but a good one to focus on as the world festers around them. The horrors in this movie run the gamut from shock to viewer's imagination; and as ghastly as those crime scenes are, they're handled with serious skill. And then there's the ending, a magic act that could've failed so easily, yet holds up amazingly well.

It's surprising that such an ugly, wet and claustrophobic movie was filmed in Southern California. And that wretched setting gets under my skin. Who knows when I'll sit down to watch this again, but it surprised me as an adult.

23 March 2018,"An unsettling, dark and hard hitting thriller that will stay with you long after its gut-wrenching end.","Deeply unsettling and intensely dark, this hard hitting thriller relies on great performances and a fully developed script to create a relentlessly oppressive tone that builds a growing sense of unease throughout. 'Se7en (1995)' is an interesting and subversive detective drama that layers its gritty, grimy and gruesome aesthetic atop a competent and compelling mystery to toe-curling effect. Plus, that bleak ending and gut-wrenching twist really punctuate the piece - providing an apt, if horrific, release for all the tension built up before it. 8/10

7 July 2003,"Cool, stylish, but still sad","""Se7en"" is a police drama about two cops trying to find a mysterious killer who is knocking off victims according to the sins they've committed. The plot is intriguing, the acting is emotional, and the thrills are incredibly creepy.

Though, this film wouldn't be as disturbing as some say it is. Sure, the ending is sad, but aside from that, it's just as 'gross' as every other forensic movie. In fact, movies like ""The Bone Collector"" are more disgusting than this.

And, of course, there's Fincher's excellent directing talent. The camera angles are cool, the chase scenes are suspenseful, and the investigation is clever. Morgan Freeman plays the grizzled old cop well, and Pitt delivers a more comedic performance than a dramatic one as the young Det. Mills.

The best part of ""Se7en"" would be Kevin Spacey's creepy role as the deadly killer. Sure, Spacey looks like your regular nice guy, but that's what makes him so evil. You hate him so much because you feel guilty for liking him.

""Se7en"" is a funny, dramatic, thrill-ride of a movie, 8.5/10.",
7 February 2009,"Ambiguous, shocking, brilliant.","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9

30 September 2006,Seven ate nine,"After the abysmal failure of Alien 3, David Fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with Se7en. His signature style of direction is all over it. Se7en is filthier than a dead stray dog at the bottom of a New Jersey toxic waste dump. It looks so miserable that people nailed to crosses seem happier.

The plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. Andrew Kevin Walker, a former Tower Records employee, conceived, in hell, a heinous story of a serial killer who offs his victims in the style of the Seven Deadly Sins. What was he smoking when he came up with that idea? Brad Pitt plays David Mills, an arrogant, over-confident, semi-experienced detective who is way ahead of himself. He uproots from a decent precinct, dragging his suffering wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) with him, to transfer to the worst in town - an unnamed, rainier-than-Glasgow Los Angeles - for no other reason than ""to make a difference"". Good luck.

Morgan Freeman is William Somerset, the most jaded and world-weary cop on the force. He only has a few days with Mills before retiring to a simple life in the country. Mills could learn a lot from him, and if he had any sense, he would. Sadly, this does not happen.

In Fight Club, Fincher exposed the rotten underbelly of a free society, the seedy flipside of American culture that most people pretend doesn't exist. Somerset says the only way to deal with a world this bad is to be apathetic, the polar opposite to Mill's belief that he can make the world a better place.

Few scripts make for good reading, but Andrew Kevin Walker's writing is one of the film's many strengths. He explored dark, character-driven horror/drama in shockers such as Brainscan and 8mm, but this is the meanest. The irony of each victims' death is made entirely justified by the killer's logic behind the madness. Of course, he does not believe he is insane. Just the world he lives in. Haven't you ever felt like that? It is important for such movies to have an atmosphere and Se7en is so rank that you can smell it. Pitt and Freeman deliver great performances, although Pitt should learn to breathe through his nose and not have constantly pursed lips. It becomes quite annoying.

Se7en is definitely the film that kick-started Fincher's career. Had he made The Game right after Alien 3, there would have been no Fight Club, Panic Room, or Social Network.

For that tiny minority who knows nothing of the film it's high time you checked it out. Even if you don't enjoy, you cannot deny its power and effect.",8
12 January 2022,City of sin,"A young detective transfers to the city to replace the aging detective who is on his final week. Strange homicides start coming in which they have to investigate. A detective thriller which doesn't follow the usual story beats. You fall into the twists and turns as you learn about the seven deadly sins, ultimately I think this movie is about pride. Brilliant performance by the killer and excellence writing throughout. It really leaves you at the end to think.

8 September 2003,Seven is one great movie I recommend strongly!,"Se7en is excellent thrilling mystery that has a great cast! Brad Pitt was very good and at the when he found out, his acting was superb! Morgan Freeman was also excellent! Kevin Spacey played John Doe flawlessly! Gwyneth Paltrow was good. R. Lee Ermey was good as always! It was surprising to see Richard Roundtree in the movie. John C. McGinley had a small part which he did good for the limited time he got to perform and Richard Portnow was good. The music by Howard Shore was very good. David Fincher's directing was unique! The last part of the movie when John Doe turns himself, when he is in the car with Pitt and Freeman, and when they were on the desert and the helicopter scenes were through the binoculars, and when Pitt and Freeman were going back and forth, that entire scene is one of the greatest in cinematic history! This film is really horrifying and not for the squeamish but if you love gruesome murder mystery movies this is a great one to watch!

13 July 2015,One of best movies ever made!,"This film got everything right! I mean every single casting choice, scene, and line was perfect! This was Brad Pitt's best role in movie, I don't recall a movie where he ever achieved better acting than here. Also, in my opinion, the same goes for Morgan freeman, him and Brad make a great on screen team. The film was a real mind bender, which I love! The dialogue was unbelievably great! The plot was so genius as well. The twist ending was one of the best twist endings I've ever seen hands down! This movie has perfect acting, characters, plot, dialogue, ending, and it definitely keeps your attention throughout, I wasn't bored once, and that's very important to me! 10/10, not a single flaw 👍🏼

14 September 2020,A very interesting mystery film with a cool premise,"Seven is a mystery thriller with an interesting premise, which you should not look into before watching this. If you've seen Zodiac or Gone Girl, you'll like the feel of this movie (especially since they're all directed by David Fincher). The mystery surrounding this movie had me intrigued and was building up well. The ending was not what I was expecting but I think it was a good conclusion. Morgan Freeman is his same amazing self, and Brad Pitt does really well in his role. There is one more actor who sold his part well, but I don't want to spoil who that is. The score by Howard Shore fits well too. I would definitely rewatch this because there are definitely things to pick up on.

8 July 2005,7 is not the lucky number for some people,"You have probably never seen a particularly ugly murder until you see ""Se7en"". Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play Det. David Mills and Det. William Somerset, respectively, who are investigating a series of murders involving the Seven Deadly Sins. No person can possibly describe how awful and vicious it is, what the murderer has done to these people. Some scenes are likely to make you squirm. To avoid spoiling the movie, I won't write about them, but if you watch the movie, you'll probably recognize them. What the murderer does to the gluttony victim is especially ugly; you might not want to eat anything after watching that scene. ""Se7en"" may be one of the most disturbing movies that you ever see, but it's good nonetheless.

12 July 2015,Se7en is Going to Freak You Out With Its Mind-Blowing Plot and Intriguing Characters,"As I was watching Se7en, I was both shocked and fascinated, this movie surely can be used as a mirror to other suspense films to show how they should be made. The anxiety and apprehension grows along the film for having such a captivating story, even if some scenes are very disturbing to watch, you can't take your eyes off. Another big contributor to make it more hypnotic is the soundtrack, when it's needed does an incredible work to elevate even more the breathtaking feeling. The director, David Fincher, did an amazing job in crafting this movie, it's proved how talented he is and something noteworthy is in some particular scenes, how they were shot regarding the style, angles of the camera that make you feel like you're in the scene.

The cast, both leading and supporting, did a marvelous work in performing the characters. They're so consistent and believable, we really have the chance to know the identity of every single one in terms of dreams, emotions, regrets. Morgan Freeman plays an old detective, Somerset, who is fed up with his detective's life, because the city and the world as in general are too hateful, the apathy is present in people's everyday life and he can't take any longer this. He's methodic, pragmatic and due to his long career in the police, he's very meticulous in a crime scene. Detective Mills is played by Brad Pitt, different from Morgan Freeman's character is a young detective with a lot of stamina, enthusiasm but he's reckless and very emotional too. The contrast between the characters is pretty perceptible and is very well explored to show a man already marked by a tough and cruel world, Somerset, and other still untouched and a bit naive about the cruelty of the society.

The murder scenes are so realistic and disgusting, they really make you feel uncomfortable and revulsion witnessing them and passing how sick the serial killer is. The murderer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey. The tension drastically grows when he's speaking, his performance succeeds in portraying a person mentally disordered, a psychopath. No Doubt, John Doe after such a remarkable acting gained a sit among the most famous psychopaths of the cinema.",9
13 June 2022,the universe in which the movie takes place is more interesting than the plot itself,"The filter, the rain and the depressing elements from the city in general set the dark, mysterious vibe of the movie, grabbing your attention from the start.

The actors are, as expect, amazing are delivering their lines and had a lot of chemistry with each other. The dinner scene was especially super natural and spontaneous.

I also really enjoyed how the film isn't scared to show heavy gore in the victim's scenes.

But, to be honest, the plot was not as intriguing as I was hoping for. Sometimes, the investigation seemed kinda forced, like they were really lucky to find answers. Maybe my expectations were way too high. Still one of the coolest thrillers I have ever seen tho.

It stars three of hollywood's best in what is a twisted mystery with some classicly memorable scenes. Right from the off, this movie sets a tone which it continues throughout with such strong performances. This is one of my all time favourite movies.

1 November 2019,Morgan Freeman at his best,"This is probably my favorite crime movie of all time. It is expertly written, acted and directed. Mr. Freeman is a credit to the industry and does a superior job in bringing this character to life. I was also happily surprised by the fact that the bad guy, or rather the actor that portrayed him, was left out of the opening credits, lending to the suspense over who did it. There is a lot to unpack in this movie, so it takes a few viewings to catch it all.

7 September 2016,Philosophical inquiry about human nature packed as a criminalistic mystery thriller,"Why is Se7en so good? Well, one of the reasons is because it was directed by none other than David Fincher who is well known for his perfectionism. Other reasons include amazing cast and interesting concept with religious main premise. Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt and one I won't mention because Fincher decided to kip him as a surprise all delivered amazing performance. How can you not like Freeman's relaxed and gentlemanly attitude (he loves books) as opposed to Pitt's sort of angry and action type character (he loves chase)?

Do you think that people who commit deadly sins deserve to live? Of course you do, but this serial killer doesn't. He thinks that the world is better without them. Theologically speaking, deadly sins are called deadly because they have been identified as a root cause to other sins and separateness from God. As a result, one who commits one of those, shall find nothing but darkness in his life and will eventually loose capacity to be happy. If one doesn't want to end like that (spiritual death) one has to firstly turn away from his sin, ask God for forgiveness and then expiate his sin. This serial killer is not merciful. He positions himself as a god who doesn't forgive or give chances to turn away from them. Since spiritual death is a final result from consistently committing deadly sins, this serial killer delivers physical death by murdering his victims in a way that particular sin harms them. He had given himself a right to deliver justice; but justice without love becomes cruel.

After this short theological reflection let me now turn my attention to detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). As I mentioned earlier, they stand opposed but somehow complement each other. Together they discover frightening and bizarre murders and react in a way specific to them. This is important when you consider the ending. Everybody knows Se7en has one the most shocking ending ever made (other being Requiem For a Dream). Since committing deadly sins influences character as well (not only spirit), carefully watching both detectives actions ads to your understanding of Se7en. This movie is not about chase or little evidences analyzed by technology; it's about seeing people behind the mask, the way we truly are. That's at least what I think.

So why did I give Se7en a symbolic seven? I don't have any particular reason. Se7en just lacks that something some other movies have. Apart from being shocking, it didn't stick with me. It's predictable as well, but it seems to me that Fincher decided to make it that way on purpose. We know what is going to happen and that gives us more ""space"" to focus our attention on characters and the way they'll react and not on story itself. Soundtrack could be somewhat better as well. Se7en also lacks that noir feeling that would've made it better.

So to conclude: Se7en is a shocking and cleverly made movie with great cast. Underneath the hub is a lot of material for reflection about human nature. Those of you more philosophically oriented are surely going to enjoy this one or should I say seven.",7
15 February 2004,Great thriller if a little cold and dehumanising.,"Two cops - one young, one old - chase a serial killer that is leaving a paper trail.

This is actually one of the best films that I have seen that I have only wanted to watch one. The reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. Like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain.

Hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. This is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. This seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of David Fincher's films. Interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions I don't want to wish upon myself.

The serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. If you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god I saw it without knowing the pay-off- although I knew there was going to be one. This is a movie after all.

Brad Pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. Here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. Morgan Freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. He is nearing retirement (in the film), but I thought all cops were about to retire in movies - I took that as read!

This is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is Se7en in longterm reflection? A horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification?

Serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but America is home to half of the world's population of them. Why is this? Maybe it is the last chance to make a mark on a society where being in the media and being in the spotlight are prized? When you have killed someone you are interesting, when you haven't you are not. Simple.",7
24 February 2008,"""Well THAT was money well spent""","It really was. I saw this movie in a Five Below store. There were about 10 copies of the normal version, and abut 2 of the special edition ones that look like notebooks. I went on a limb and bought the special edition for $5. I had no idea what this movie was like nor what it was about. But I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. This movie turned out to be a personal favorite. Morgan Freeman was excellent, not just because he's a great actor, but because in this movie he was different than the ""optimistic, nature-loving"" characters he usually plays. In this movie he plays the close-to-retirement Detective William Somerset, who dislikes the world and what it has become. Brad Pitt gave a great performance as the loud-mouthed, over-jumpy Detective David Mills. Usually I don't like Brad Pitt and I think hes obnoxious and a lousy actor, but in this movie I'll make an exception. He was obnoxious in some ways in this movie, but it fit his character perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow gave a decent performance as the stressed Tracy Mills. R. Lee Ermey was great as the Police Captain, I always enjoy his performances no matter what the circumstances. Even the bad guy (Will not give the actor's name to prevent spoilers) was Grade A in his part. The weather was rainy for most of the movie, and scenes were always lighted in small doses, meaning it was dark and gloomy for most of the film. THis really set the tone. I recommend this movie to fans of crime, thriller movies. 10/10",10

18 April 2016,Another great performance by Kevin Spacey,"Anyone else think that Kevin Spacey is being type-cast as psychopathic serial killers? It's only because he's so damn good at playing them.

Se7en is no exception. In this film, he plays the unnamed serial killer who kills people in conjunction with the seven deadly sins. His portrayal of the serial killer is chilling, unnerving and powerful. Se7en delves well into his backstory and fleshes him out as a character.

Although I did think the film was a little anti-climactic in terms of its scariness. I expected a crime thriller to be gorier than this and I was disappointed when it wasn't, but this is more of a minor criticism.

16 June 2020,"""What's in the box?""","Se7en remains one of the most disturbing movies I have ever watched. Unlike many other movies made during and since its release, Se7en refrains from gore and somehow becomes even more appalling because of it. Over time, general audiences have been desensitized to violence and gore. What may have been considered absolutely horrifying back in the 50s is nothing nowadays. So instead of showing the results of the crime, director David Fincher uses a somewhat Hitchcockian technique; by refraining to show the results of the horrible acts committed, and instead of revealing it through dialogue and acting, notably in the 'LUST' scene and 'SLOTH' scene, Fincher lets our brain do the heavy lifting and figure out what happened, and what it must have felt like. Fincher also goes out of his way to come up with the most disgusting ways a person can die, although some are admittedly tame. ('PRIDE' had it easy) The acting is incredible, featuring one of Morgan Freeman's best performances as an old, broken-down police detective, and Brad Pitt in one of his finest roles, and his acting skills are on display in his explosive acting during the finale. However, the best actor in this movie is the actor who plays John Doe. Observe his acting. Smug, self-satisfied, intelligent, analytical. His composure and fearlessness. The movie rests on this one actor to say every line perfectly. He does. His performance is just as affecting as Anthony Hopkin's in Silence of the Lambs. But the most impressive feat of all, David Fincher does something impossible: he makes the villain seem like a hero. It is hard to explain, but there are some villains that give us a glimpse into our deepest, subconscious desires. And that's terrifying. We all have parts of ourselves that we try to hide and pretend don't exist. These types of villains hold up a mirror and say, look. This is you. It's like watching a perverted car wreck that you can't look away from that hits you somewhere deep and hidden.",10

31 May 2022,A Masterpiece,"Without a doubt the best mystery film of all time. The story and development of this film is just awesome and the ending is definitely one of the best of all time. Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances maybe his best and Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are perfect too. I could watch it every day because it's just gorgeous. Definitely in my top 20 of all time!

8 November 2006,Overrated... Come on. It's good but not a masterpiece! Many PLOT HOLES and utterly predictable!,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",4
22 March 2017,Generic/Masterpiece,"Inspired by the Divine Comedy (there are other religious books that inspire the villain but i don't remember them), the psicopath John Doe (Kevi Spacey) tries to teach a sermon by torturing people based on one of the seven deadly sins they are accused of committing.

This movie biggest sin (pun intended) is that only became a masterpiece that it is known only half way through it. The first hour is a generic detective movie with all the clichés: the two cops who are opposite from each other(Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt), a murder mystery, etc.

But aside from that, it's a great movie worth watching specially for the twist at the ending.

1 October 2019,See David Fincher's later work to enjoy better films,"Despite the presence of the surely very talented Freeman and Pitt, this early David Fincher film is, like his other early films such as Alien 3, marred by his strange artistic obsession with grime and filth (every location and even the look of the film is dirty, scummy and excessively grimy for no realistic reason). Having said this, in his more recent films, such as The Game (Sean Penn and Michael Douglas), Fincher has grown out of this style and made some excellent movies.

9 March 2014,Good movie,"Seven is an extremely good crime thriller. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are really good in this movie. The movie is really dark with many effective scenes in the movie. It is like the director is going out of his way to make the viewer queasy. All in all it is a good movie if a bit dark for my liking but the characters are good and the narrative is also worthy of respect. It is a blend of crime, horror and Thriller movies and shows and in some respects it is a foreshadow to the CSI series that now are all over TV.

Great performance from Brad Pitt in this movie. The gritty feel of the movie is also very realistic.

12 November 2007,The standard of excellence for the psychological thriller. A masterpiece and a classic.,"You really can't say enough about Se7en. It may have lacked critical acclaim (how this wasn't at least nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay is beyond me), but this film is easily in the top 10 films of the 1990's, and one could argue that it is the best. Andrew Walker pens a marvelous script that is brilliantly realized by David Fincher, along with the help of 3 of the greatest actors of their generations.

David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a young up and coming detective who's just been transferred. His partner is William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who's on the verge of retirement. Different though they may be, they must track a serial killer who is choosing his victims according to the seven deadly sins (gluttony, sloth, greed, lust, pride, envy, and wrath).

What makes Se7en so excellent in my mind is how incredibly real it is. There's the gritty feel to the film, and Fincher uses great shots and locations to effectively pass on his intentions to us. The film is one of the most suspenseful I've ever seen, and that is also attributed to Fincher, not to mention a wonderful musical score. Andrew Walker's script is fantastic. Easily one of the best of all time. It's such a simple concept, but the creation of the characters and the depth and development of each one is one truly remarkable quality of the script. The best quality of course, is the unpredictable, unorthodox, and scary ending that will make your stomach sink like a weight. The cinematography and editing are brilliant as the film is fluid and seamless. Technically, this film is perfect.

The acting...well, anyone who's ever said Brad Pitt is for show obviously hasn't seen this or Fight Club. He's wonderful as the motivated, yet rash and sarcastic David Mills. It's a great character arc, and Pitt plays the complex character with heart and ease. Morgan Freeman...what can you say? He's Morgan Freeman, so he's excellent. Once again, a well written character that the actor takes and makes his own. Freeman is magnificent again.

Of course, our 2 detectives are great, but the true stand out of the film is the actor who plays the killer, whose inclusion in the film was kept secret until the day of release. Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything. He gives a magnificent, yet haunting and disturbing performance that will stick with you for day after day. It is one of the best villainous performances of all time. The final confrontation is spectacular because of him.

All in all, Se7en is a must see if you are a movie fan. It's one of the best films I've ever seen, and you'd be a fool to miss this classic. As terrifying as it is suspenseful, Se7en is a thriller that will stick with you, an experience you'll never forget. I cannot recommend this movie more.

27 November 2013,7 Cardinal Sins ( Could the freak be any more vague?),"I've watched this true masterpiece several times over the years,I have yet to watch a film that comes anywhere near it in terms of pure horror at the lengths humans will go to inflict pain on each other... The brilliance of this film is you don't see the acts been done,it's left to your own imagination. Brad Pitt,Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are fantastically cast , the setting is wet and dark,( you never find out where the city is meant to be ).A Constant feeling of dread runs through this film which I can only say is an absolute must watch movie. Its is in my(and many others) opinion, probably one the best films ever made in the history of film making .. WATCH IT!

2 August 2004,Dark masterpiece of the genre.,"David Fincher's breakthrough Se7en is one of few movies that deserves to be called a masterpiece. An incredibly dark movie (for mainstream that is) about cruelty and human depravity that hooks it's fangs into the viewers spine like a bloodthirsty beast and won't let go even after the movie's over. This is both very wellplayed and wellcrafted. Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey all do top-notch performances, the script is one of the strongest in years and the ending must be on of the best I've seen. It's strange that a movie that doesn't rely on shock effects can be this shocking. After I saw this I was amazed by the pure cleverness of it all and the way I felt. The depressing mood of it all is just perfect and it works wonderfully as a foundation on which this movie lies. Go see it now.

16 March 2022,Can't Hide in The World Out in The Open,"Having grown up watching many a crime series, it is easy to spot that the most riveting quality of American Education is that it brings the whole world out into the open, right amongst the universities, and right amidst the show, thereby clearly pitting both as neither a ticket to la-la-land, nor a distraction from what is. You could be conservative with a twang to keep you over your attachments or you could be seasoned enough to not need them, but when it comes to dealing with the world, you can neither pretend to be over it, nor can you pretend to be beyond it, by way of pitching your upbringing or your diurnal duties as demanding propriety of an exclusive sort. Given that as that, just about any occupation anywhere tends to merge psychological orientations into just a spot of eternal damnation engendered by a need to see damnation in exclusion, whether of a criminal at large, or of an old bloke unattuned to the demands of inclusiveness in our own small worlds.

30 March 2022,Amazing Film,"Se7en is a 1995 Crime/Thriller directed by David Fincher that stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two homicide detectives on the hunt for a serial killer who is committing various dark and gruesome crimes based on the Seven Deadly Sins. This movie is very well filmed and tells a haunting yet realistic story. In the sense that there could be a serial killer who does things like this in real life, because nothing is too extraordinary in the film to the point where it's not possible; so, that's what makes the brutality of the crimes so impactful and horrific.

The film has great direction by Fincher. The movie does a good job at keeping you interested throughout. It is written well and Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman really bounced off one another. I was surprised with their chemistry on screen because I have never seen them together like this in a film before.

The films aesthetic throughout the runtime is dark, gritty and filled with dread through the use of production design, composition, color and cinematography. The colors in the film were always murky. Stylistically the film is beautiful in a sick way with how Fincher manipulates what's on the screen and how it's on the screen. Although, there were times in the movie where I didn't even want to look at the screen, but there were also times where Fincher doesn't even need to show us and we still know something horrifc is on the other side by the way it is suggested through the mise-en-scene. (The Lust sin in particular). There is a clear vision that is being executed. However, the focus is not all on the violence, but on the setting and the people as well. The characters all have depth and they feel like real people that we have to spend time with. The scene with Pitt, Paltrow, and Freeman having dinner together is an example of one of these scenes we get that are character driven. The setting is constantly shown off through the mise-en-scene.

Overall, I thought Se7en was an amazing movie. I thought it was written well. There were some great dialogue scenes in the middle of the movie as well as the end. The end was really good one of the best parts of the whole movie. The entire third act is pretty insane to be honest. It was very well written and executed; totally had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The cinematography, writing, acting, and direction were all very well done. The film was disturbing and gritty yet in a way very real which makes it all the more shocking and the climax is one of the best I have seen in a while. I really liked it and I recommend checking it out especially if you're into darker movies.",9
11 February 2012,This ain't a seven: it's got to be at least an eight or a nine.,"I consider David Fincher's Seven to be a precursor/forerunner of the 'torture porn' phenomenon—more specifically, the Saw movies: it utilises the grunge aesthetic that has become synonymous with such films, features a self-righteous villain who delights in playing gruesome games, revels in the extreme nature of its victims' suffering, and delivers an uncompromising and rather preposterous finale that is designed to hit like a kick to the gut.

However, despite being the impetus for what has become one the most over-saturated and tiresome of sub-genres (as well as that irritating trend of replacing letters in a title with numbers), I don't resent Fincher's film one bit: it's just too good to hold a grudge against—a masterpiece of the macabre that admittedly requires a little suspension of disbelief to be truly effective, but which is so well crafted and so horrific that to do so is both easy and worthwhile.

Fincher is able to successfully brush off the debacle that was Alien 3 and prove himself to be the accomplished movie-maker that many suspected him to be. Without studio interference, he successfully delivers his vision—a visually stunning chiller that delivers thrills, chills, grisly horror aplenty, without resorting to cheap scares or overtly explicit gore. Despite its gruesome subject matter, Se7en doesn't rely on relentless splatter to shock: the mere suggestion of what has occurred possesses the power to repel, with brief glimpses of the murder victims' corpses offering just enough grisly detail to satisfy the viewer's morbid curiosity.

An ingenious script from Andrew Kevin Walker, impeccable performances from its amazing cast (including a particularly outstanding performance from Kevin Spacey), and what what has to be one of most harrowing and unsettling endings in cinema, all adds up to one hell of a fine movie.",9

30 November 2007,Dark Human Nature,"What is the most simple way to present the Human's dark side? The answer is by sins: Sins that from the Fifth Century announce Man's most awful deviations from God.

This movie isn't catholic yet, nor does it have an approach: it's impressively dark and violently grim. From the first start, the characters are presented surrounded by a whispering, sad rain. The mood is also set with dampened colors and grayish tones. Nobody ever smiles in the film, they laugh for few seconds when united in a dinner. But throughout the story, Detective Mills (Pitt) and Detective Somerset (Freeman) will set up on a case that is horrendous and enigmatic: a serial killer roams the city with the Capital Sins as basis to create his assassinations. He preaches, according to Somerset. Mills isn't accustomed to the following Odyssey, he is yet not aware of the fatal obscurity of the Human Mind. Somerset is about to retire, and he knows what he deals with his job, Morgan Freeman with his tired eyes show you everything the character has seen among his trail.

As the play is opened; the killer behind the murders shows to be analytical and intelligent and he isn't afraid of people chasing him: he just introduces him to his ultimate ""work"". He plays with them. He presents a puzzle for them to solve as he is in total control. Kevin Spacey will surprise everyone with his psychotic demeanor and his empty gestures, showing spiritual deprivation.

""Se7en"" is likely not for everyone. It is intended to expose the Dark, Twisted side of mankind, engulfed by a series of morbidly well thought murders. Actings are stupendous, all variating from a negative panoply: depicting Sadness, Anger, Worry superbly. Nothing is cheerful, nothing is lightning and warming. The movie shows you perfectly what man is all about on their obscure range. It is shattering, it is demanding. But it is one of the most excellent experiences on nowadays cinema.",10
24 August 2006,"(POSSIBLE SPOILER)...Serial killer story within a ""Law and Order"" format...","Watching SEVEN, you almost expect a beer commercial to interrupt at any moment because it's like watching a harder-edged, slightly grittier, mean streets version of LAW AND ORDER with a more experienced detective (MORGAN FREEMAN) conducting a sort of balancing act with his footloose, craving for action sidekick (BRAD PITT) wanting to get away from his desk work.

It's gritty stuff all the way through, with neon lights flashing amid grimy apartments, chases through crooked alleys and across grimy rooftops and down fire escapes that break the tension of a story whose central theme is the hunt for a serial killer intent on showing off his skill to a detective he professes to admire. As the killer, KEVIN SPACEY adopts a zombie-like pose, a flat monotone and recites his dialog with a straight face--but he's never quite believable enough in the role.

BRAD PITT spends much of the time protesting loudly against the authority figure who tries to calm him down when things get out of hand. But his final emotional scene is a challenging one and he does manage to bring the right anger, confusion and bitter resentment as he confronts the man who has played his final trick on him. He's unrestrained in this final moment and it's the kind of emotion the audience can understand at this point.

MORGAN FREEMAN, as the more restrained, experienced older partner on the brink of retirement, is excellent but his final decision to open a box (without revealing plot details here) is a questionable procedure.

Summing up: Some tense, well-staged moments but the overall effect is less than impressive as a study of a serial killer on the loose.

Overpraised by film noir addicts.",6
4 August 2022,Joyful movie about inner strength,"Kevin Spacey plays John Doe, a misunderstood but well meaning community leader who does good deeds in dirty New York City. His goal is to help people. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are two bumbling detectives who add a comic element. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a depressed wife who goes on a spiritual journey and ends up in a better place with some help.

Overall the movie is upbeat and really points to how important it is for people like Kevin Spacey/John Doe to help others overcome their inner demons from obesity to laziness and other evils. His techniques are very effective! And he even does expert manicures! He is a multitalented saint.

After watching this movie, anyone can become inspired to help those around them be better people.

8 September 2007,Brilliant bad guy with frustrating ending,"This movie is a cross between Silence of the lambs and Bone collector. There are some very clever investigation scenes and clever writing and set creation.

This movie was a showcase for Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. This movie had one of Morgan Freeman's best roles where he plays a educated, intelligent and experienced detective. Brad Pitt has a role but is not as impressive.

This movie certainly had a new approach to police / horror movies. This movie and Silence of the lambs brought a whole new level of gore and horror to mystery movies. This is not a kid friendly movie and does not have a happy ending.

28 March 2015,May be the best film ever!,"This film may be the best film I have ever watched. I was gripped from start to finish and actually applauded when the credits started to roll. The last time I did that was when I watched 'The Sixth Sense'. The writing is exceptional, the plot believable and the acting is of the finest standard. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt make a great partnership, even though it would seem unlikely, given their different approaches to dealing with homicide cases.

I would ask everyone to try not to second guess the outcome, but rather follow the clues, as the detectives do.

This is a fine film of the finest quality, with an ending to make your hairs stand on end.

11 October 2014,Masterpiece,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Se7en"" (1995) is a true masterpiece, and i don't use this word often, actually, i use it very rarely. This film blow me away from the first time i saw it, and i saw it many times after. It's always engaging from start till finish. This is one of the best stories ever told on screen. More of it, the story isn't that really important in this movie. What important is that you will feel your self in there, at the bottom of Dantes inferno, this is New York you won't see in advertising pictures.

One of my favorite directors (and of the best ever) master David Fincher created an unforgettable piece of work. This film is must be seen to understand, what a real film is about, and it's not about the action. The ending of this film will leave you speechless.

Overall, 10/10 for this motion picture, it's a true art, true cinematic tour De force, with images and characters you won't eve forget after witnessing ""Se7en"". A must watch.",10
24 February 2004,"Overrated, predictable, with lots of bad acting by Brad Pitt","This is a top 250 movie?!? Brad Pitt's acting is shallow, stereotypical, and not nuanced. He does the California surfer-dude routine throughout the entire movie as though some uneducated simpleton dolt could wind up with his job...sorry, but I don't think so. The plot line relies on a connect...the...dots methodology -- contrived, and largely predictable with action interspersed with banal social dialogue. I gave this 4/10 mostly for the fine acting of Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. Very silly -- Brad Pitt's acting had me laughing...and not in a good way. In defense of Mr. Pitt, I think he was badly miscast since I've seen other movies in which he does at least a respectable job.

26 December 2015,admirable work,"not only the script. but the acting, the photography, the inspired use of genre's clichés, the old well known end who becomes more than a surprise are the pieces who defines the film more than a good one. its virtue - to be more than a crime movie. to transform a story in fine analysis of emotions, desires and lost hopes of the characters. a film about justice. in a very nuanced manner. because the details are more than clues. because the tension is in brilliant manner directed. because Brad Pitt could be, for many, a real surprise. because it seems be the film of Kevin Spacey. but it is result of an admirable artistic team who saw explore each detail. a film like an experience.

12 May 2008,"""Se7en"" out of 10?","Not on my scale. I choose ""1"" as a mark for this one. Why? Because it's sick and perverted, neither entertaining nor clever, neither beautiful nor comfortably ugly. Just oppressive. It's got very unpleasant atmosphere and imagery. Who are these movies made for? They are disgusting. When you watch this you feel as if you were bathing in manure. Is it supposed to be the development of cinema and taste of the audience since Chaplin movies? I'd rather keep with the old Chaplin ones.

One disgusting occurrence goes into another, then - another, and so on until the list of the deadly sins is over. This flick deserves to be a piece of entertainment for bored hit men, who can later discuss ""the head in the box"" with their buddies (remember ""Max Payne""?).

If a movie is artistically weak and leaves an empty feeling - all because of some fiction created by somebody, what's the purpose of it all? I should also mention that many years ago I considered this movie to be wise. And of course I wouldn't bother to write a review, but, damn, it's on the top 250 list, which is depressing.

Watch our ""Stalker"", ""Ostrov"", or ""Solyaris"" if you want a clever film dealing with sins. That's all I've got to say.

2 August 1998,A film that scars,"David Fincher once said: ""I don't know how much movies should entertain. To me I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about JAWS is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again."" Well, SE7EN gave me a scar... and wow.. What a scar. 'cause it's so dark and so scary that I keept thinking about it for days, not to mention while walking out of the cinema. So if you haven't seen this one yet, all I can say is: I N V U.

2 May 2016,Se7en: One hell of a creepy movie,"Se7evn once again proves David Fincher is the master of composing a story that perfectly balances drama with suspense, and it then finished off with an excellent twist ending. Major credit also goes to Andrew Kevin Walker who creates a story that is creepy, compelling and above all original. The progression of Se7en is significant as it starts out with an insignificant investigation that evolves into an extremely intense encounter. The movie keeps a good pace whether it's giving the reader time think through what's happened or forcing them to predict what's going to happen. The constant chase makes for a great movie pace, which is further enhanced by the detective duo. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfectly cast as Detectives Somerset and Mills. The progression of the relationship between the two characters is done perfectly as the viewer sees the ups and downs both characters go through. The introduction of Tracy then introduces a huge wild card, which has a huge impact on the mentality of both characters as well as the ending. Se7en's villain John Doe is what ultimately makes this movie. The brutality, as well as the meaning behind each of his murders, is both fascinating and disgusting at the same time. The scene where Mill and Somerset question Doe as they drive to the location of the final two victims is the best scene of the film. Doe finally reveals his motives behind his murders that while they are rather disturbing, do actually make sense. The creep factor of Se7en is comparable to that of a scary movie. It's frightening visuals, themes, and the villain makes the movie much more suspenseful and frightening than many would expect. However, its the relatable characters and setting keep the movie grounded. Top that all off with one of the best twist ending that leaves the viewer jaw dropped throughout the credits, and you get one of the best thrillers of all time.",9
16 February 2022,Never Before Has Person Coughing Made Me Jump In Shock,"If you've seen this film, you'll know what I'm talking about by the review headline. This film does not mess around. Every aspect is on point. From the lighting, color pallet, accurate dialog, camera movement, character development and of course the editing and script. This is a tense and gruesome story with thrills that don't rely on a loud sound effects but in pure genuine and unexpected surprise, shock or even disbelief. This is about two detectives, one an intelligent veteran about to retire and a young buck who just moved to this city with his wife. They team up on what ends up being the start of a serial killing spree. It is really interesting to watch how the two detective's approaches to just about everything are in contrast to each other and how they begin to gel as partners. But the real story is the gruesomely unique killings they must investigate as they attempt to stop the killer before his finishes his plan. This film is hauntingly engrossing as all cinematic facets engulf the viewer in tension. If you have the stomach for such things you'll want to but never be able to forget them; this is a must see.

31 December 2013,Fincher's Best Film,"If Fincher didn't invent the convention of the brilliant serial killer always being just one step ahead of the police, he unquestionably perfected it here. This is the twisted psychopath unleashing his vengeance upon the deserving, avaricious world at its absolute best. And this remains Fincher's best film.

Two cops in New York are hunting a serial killer. The presence of the killer is momentous even before the detectives track him down, once caught, the killer is channeled through Kevin Spacey with a disturbingly authentic evil calm.

Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this amazing original script that was almost never made. Walker wrote it as an original screenplay around 1991. Apparently he was quite depressed at the time. New Line Cinema bought it, but it took years before it went into production Walker went to work on other projects thinking the script would never be made, but it was. It was released Sept 22, 1995. By using the seven deadly sins as the basis for justifying the killer's prerogative, the film's plot is definitely one of the best around, added to this amped up, excellent performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, the production comes off flawlessly, but Seven is so haunting and goes down as one of the best Thrillers of all time because of Fincher's vision of a hellish New York. This world is poison and Fincher makes it seep.

The grit and grime of the crimes scenes combined with filth of the city streets, alleyways, rooftops, constantly being pounded with rain, darkness engulf even the few happy moments of the film. So much of this film's beauty is in the compilation. The sets and lighting are so complex that making Seven must have been the result of a finely tuned crew, each member bulked up on their own creative genius. It is how everything, every element aligns perfectly that makes Se7en such a phenomenal filmmaking achievement.

10 April 2017,"Awesome, twisted serial killer flick","Se7en is one of my favorite movies. I guess that says a lot about me. I can't pass it by when flicking through my cable guide. Every time I watch it I see or hear something new. Morgan Freeman is superb as a tired and emotionally beaten down cop getting ready to retire. Brad Pitt is very convincing as a young new detective running his first serial killer investigation with all the nerves and ambitious recklessness you'd expect from having to partner with a veteran on his last case before retirement. The duo face a witty killer who kills based on the seven deadly sins. The real stars of this movie are the writer, director and set designers for presenting incredibly intricate and graphic murder scenes and making all the characters likable. The writing is deep and you have to pay attention to every detail. As the bodies mount you find yourself counting down each deadly sin to the incredible climax and shocking but truly awesome ending. You can't go wrong with the cast assembled in Se7en. It's a great movie for whodunit fans that like a little more tension and voyeurism in their crime dramas. It will not disappoint.

5 December 2003,"Unique, horrifying thriller which leaves you desperate for a happy ending.","A film that genuinely gets better with repeated viewings, Se7en is a dark, depressing and disturbing tale which simply refuses to give the audience any grain of comfort. Brad Pitt proves for perhaps the first time in his career (forget his over-rated antics in Twelve Monkeys) that he is an edgy, dangerous actor with a good eye for an atypical role. Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action.

Detective David Mills (Pitt) joins a new homicide squad in a particularly unappealing and unsafe (un-named) city. He is partnered with William Somerset (Freeman), an old, wise, experienced cop who is just a few days from retirement. The mismatched pair are sent to a crime scene where a fat man has been tied to his dinner table and forced to eat and eat and eat until his stomach bursts. Scrawled on the wall is the word ""Gluttony"", and when other bodies start turning up alongside messages like ""Greed"" and ""Sloth"", they soon realise they are dealing with a serial killer who gets his ""inspiration"" from the seven deadly sins.

However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. The ingenuity begins to show in a scene as powerful as it is unexpected, in which the killer gives himself up with two murders to go. For a moment, it seems that the film has made a terrible mis-step, but in actual fact we are being readied for one of the most fiendishly clever and shocking climaxes imaginable. The film ends on such a cruel note you'll come away from the film wanting to shout ""no - that can't be it... it can't end there!"" Oh, but it can! What's most disturbing is that when the killer explains his motives, he actually makes a totally valid and agreeable point about why he chose his victims. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing cliches is exactly what Se7en aims to do (even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards). The best mainstream Hollywood film of the '90s.",
22 March 2015,"serious real , not for light mood , well acted","this is of 1995 and yet scenes are so realistic . it seems they really killed a person to show believable autopsy . Morgan freeman as about to retire detective plays the part very well while brad Pitt is young guy who partners him in last case . gwyneth paltrow looks charming . story is depressing . notice how the credits roll at ending , then you will know the idea of director . there is a chase scene in which cop is alert & determined , committed to his duty , uncaring of his scars , yet evil sneaks up on him . the picture of life painted is quite bleak . the limitations of law rule book are shown . the apathy of human beings to each other makes situation grim and hopeless for viewer .

12 May 2009,"Warm Up to the Far Superior ""Zodiac""","Director David Fincher gets points for atmosphere, even if that atmosphere is mostly unpleasant. This movie is gloomy, even for a serial killer flick.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are detectives on the trail of a killer who uses the seven deadly sins as the theme for his murders. I might have liked this movie more if it wasn't in love with its own grunge aesthetic -- as it is, it's the kind of film to give fanboys wet dreams, but leaves others wondering what the fuss is about. David Fincher would revisit the serial killer genre again with about 1,000 times more success 13 years later with ""Zodiac.""

Also starring Gwyneth Paltrow in an early role, and Kevin Spacey, intolerably snarky as usual as the killer.

Grade: B-",6
15 June 2012,One of the most successful movies of its kind,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9
17 October 2000,"Disturbingly effective, for two audiences","A while back I thought after seeing Seven that this is a film gets in the crowd of the macabre disturbing films including Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It does and then it doesn't as well. It has that kind of horrific core on display of humanities ills alongside the violent nature. But it is also a Hollywood thriller, with big stars, and on that level it's just as affecting and successful. It's almost like a crossover film by having this mystery-investigation side of the story, led by Putt and Freeman, while the investigation itself making it pretty clear its no-holds-barred moments. Fincher's work as a director here is absolute in making style serve the story.

It does this and more by making grissly images of cruelness and dark vibes that would make Nosferatu cringe (slightly). Story follows aging detective (Freeman in one of his better roles) and new detective (Pitt does OK here, too) who hunt down a killer who is doing it in according to the 7 deadly sins. Nailbitting all the way to the end, even when we find out the John Doe (and if your on this site, you know Kevin Spacey plays one of the most clever villains in recent thriller history). Entertaining, and with an everlasting appeal that has spawned on a series of lesser films (i.e. Saw), and still holding up just as strong ten+ years later.",10
27 April 2023,Milestone in serial killers films,"Maybe more for me than SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. And I am not at all a fan of serial killers topics. I loved ZODIAC and recently loved THE EXECUTION from Russia. But this one is also one of the best from David Fincher. One of the most gloomy, darkest, desperate film from the ""new' Hollywood industry, because this is not and indie production, as far as I know. Brad Pitt at his peak, even for his earliest career, Morg Freeman terrific, and the story...production design which push a young just married couple to commit suicide. So, if you absolutely want to see ONE serial killer film in your life, choose this one. But I don't mean SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is not worth, not at all, but it is different, told from another angle; HANNIBAL too; TV show and movie. And I don't even speak of the ending.... Ending to which Kevin Spacey is involved in, as he also was in USUAL SUSPECT. Another twist ending, the most unforgettable of all times.

6 September 2022,"Classical & Genre (Noir) Tropes Given The Post-Modern ""Look-See"" by David Fincher & Crew","David Fincher has to be an Admirer of E. C. Comics. Especially the Horror and Crime Titles.

Because if there Ever was a Re-Incarnation of those Unique, Brilliantly Written, and Colorful Comics, Here it is. They were Ultimately ""Banned"" by the Capitulation to the Self-Imposed ""Comics-Code"" (where have we seen that before?).

This is E. C. Comics in Cinema Form with all the Medium's Added Dimensions. There were Titles Like...""CrimeSuspenStories"" and ""ShockSuspenStories"", and Others.

Speaking of Dementia, Kevin Spacey as ""John Doe"", is a Serial Killer for the ""Books"", or as ""John Doe"" Would Have You Believe. Because He Uses a Sledge-Hammer as Opposed to a Tap on the Shoulder to Get You Attention.

Here We Have A-Listers Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt Both Bringing Their Baggage Attached and Giving Fincher and Crew the Lead-In to One of the Most Talked-About Films of the 90's.

Fincher Coats the Movie with Sepia-Toned Rust, and seems to have Conjured the Devil and Ordered ""Light"" Off-Set and Bad Weather.

Dusted Off ""Satan's Bible"" with Emphasis on the Chapter Preaching About the ""Se7ven Deadly Sins"", or Virtues, Depending, and Wha-La. Welcome Back E. C. You'll Love the New Millennium.

The Difference Now is...

This is a Billion Dollar Industry, oh about that ""Code"" Thing, Tish, Tish...We Don't Do That Now. That's for the Fringe that Truly Believe We are Living in the ""End Times""

However, this Film is Also Saying Such, in Terms Mostly Articulated by ""Seen it All"", Worn Down Detective ""Somerset"" (get it?), who has Admitts...He's Never Seen Anything, Like This.

Not So for the ""Celebrating Life"" Newbie Detective Mills, Fresh for the New Millennium, and Grist for the ""Mill"" (get it?).

It's a Film that Provokes Disgust, and Thoughts About an Abomination Celebration, say the ""Do Gooders"", and it Show Signs that We as a Culture are Nearing ""The Apocalypse"".

The Antithesis to that Bit of Nonsense is Perhaps the Reasoning of the ""Catharsis Theory"", Purging Our Sins Before They Occur by Venting Through ""Art"".

25 June 2018,Before Saw there was Se7en,"I can't believe it's been 23 years since this movie came out. An absolute classic. Before the Saw franchise there was Se7en. A crime thriller about a self-righteous messianic wannabe that decided to kill (or set up to be killed) seven people who'd committed one of the seven deadly sins.

23 years later this movie still holds its own proving that it wasn't just a movie for that era. Set in Metro it could have been any city. The setting was perpetually rainy, dreary, filthy and crime-ridden. It could've been Gotham, Metropolis, Sin City, etc. It was the perfect setting for the crimes that unfolded.

The performances were great but no one could outdo the psycho. Considering that there may be some out there that have been under a rock for the last 23 years I don't want to say who the psycho was. But his ability to convey pure smug moralism after having been responsible for multiple deaths was just eerie and even rage-inducing.

Se7en is a must see for psychological crime thriller enthusiasts.",8
31 July 2013,Dark thriller full of perfection,"Its today's cult status this movie gained thanks to the excellent work of director David Fincher (whom this was only the second major movie in his career) and screenwriter A.K.Walker (who also wrote the screenplay for ""8MM""). With this film Fincher ranked himself among the most wanted directors and gained a reputation of true heir of Hitchcock, which was confirmed by his later movies ""Play"" and ""Panic Room"". The assignment of roles in the movie is excellent, and I especially need to emphasize Brad Pitt's acting (as in ""Fight Club"") which proved that he is not just a beauty figure whose main task is to lure women to cinemas, but also showed that he knows to act! Freeman is excellent in the role of a veteran detective - like it was made for him, and Spacey in the role of the killer was, as usual, brilliant and gravely. The atmosphere of the film is so dark and depressing that the bizarre and terrible murders make it even more stressful. I was particularly impressed by the way murders were described, which are quite original and leave a big impression on the viewer. (Something like that was attempted in ""Resurrection"" with C.Lambert but not very successfully, and ""Saw"" - interesting, but not on a par with ""Se7en""). All in all this is an excellent and original movie which is rarely seen.",10
20 February 2022,You can watch this movie 100 times and still appreciate every detail that Fincher presents you.,"Se7en(1995) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Hulu. The storyline follows two detectives in New York, a young man who recently transferred to the city and an aging detective about to retire. They are partnered and sent to investigate a strange murder and quickly discover a quote that turns into a theme when the murder resembles a passage from the seven deadly sins. As the murders continue they become more heinous and the detectives get closer and closer to the killer.

This movie is directed by David Fincher (Gone Girl) and stars Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby), Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Kevin Spacey (Usual Suspects), Gwyneth Paltrow (Iron Man), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) and Richard Roundtree (Shaft).

This storyline is magnificently intricate. Every aspect of this movie is well written - the characters and their backstories, details of the crime scenes, the thought process of the killer, the pace they unveil details about the killer and the nuances of being a New York Detective. Everything is outstanding. The music in the background throughout the film keeps a level of intensity from beginning to end. Even when things get lighthearted you know it's destined to be short lived. There are two scenes in this that belong in the American cinematic hall of fame - the dinner scene between Paltrow and Freeman and the final ""What's in the box"" moment. You can watch this movie 100 times and still appreciate every detail that Fincher presents you.

This is an all time great movie that's an American cinematic classic. This is an easy 10/10 and absolute must see.",10

15 April 2004,WHY is this considered a good movie????,"I'm sorry for those of you who think that a watered-down pseudo-sadistic murder spree makes for compelling or an intelligent film. It doesn't.

Let's set aside for the moment the miserable lighting and cinematography in this film -- half the movie is so monochromatic that it's difficult to tell what you're looking at, and the 'artistic' angles compound the problem.

Let's set aside the absolutely rotten characterizations -- Freeman tries hard with his portrayal of the absolutely-cookie-cutter jaded soon-to-retire cop, but there's nothing there, and Brad Pitt's scenery-chewing over-the-top ""look at me, I'm sooooo mad!"" rookie-detective turn is, frankly, laughably silly. Gwyneth Paltrow has absolutely nothing to do, and Spacey's character is...well, he's not a character. He's a bit of hackneyed dialogue, without motive, without charisma, without even a semi-consistent tone (we're supposed to believe that this infinitely careful killer is also so ramblingly incompetent that he leaves evidence all over his apartment? That he's so confident he knocks off cops' wives, but so easily frazzled he loses his cool under light questioning in the police car?

Let's instead focus on plot holes so wide you could toss a horse through them.

What kind of police department is this? There is not ONE ATTEMPT to answer some of the obvious questions that would be asked in any murder investigation (is there surveillance video of the lawyer's offices (there would be)? Where did the killer get his antibiotics (those things are tracked, numbskulls)? Why aren't the cops even TRYING to predict the killer's victim pattern, after they've been given ridiculously explicit hints? Most importantly, the entire ending is completely implausible...under no circumstances would any department, anywhere, EVER, send two detectives off with the high-profile confessed murderer like that. When Spacey proposes his little 'deal,' the cops would have said ""tough. Rot in jail, sicko.""

I suppose the success of ""Se7en"" proves that if you shower an audience with enough slickly-produced gore (not even that imaginatively rendered), they'll buy it, particularly if you layer on some random pseudo-literary quotation to give it a sheen of ""art."" A sad comment on the state of the horror genre.",2
4 December 2013,Deadly Sins,"David Fincher directed this dark mystery that stars Brad Pitt as detective Mills, who joins more experienced detective Somerset(played by Morgan Freeman) in their murder investigation that seems quite bizarre, as the victims were killed via the judgment of the seven deadly sins(gluttony, sloth, etc.) The killer is quite clever and patient, though the detectives do eventually track him down, and after his arrest, learn that he has one more victim in mind to complete his master-plan, and that it involves Mills' wife(played by Gwyneth Paltrow)... Impressively directed and acted film is supremely well-crafted, with a knockout of an ending you won't see coming, though it is so unrelentingly bleak & depressing that it can be a chore to sit through, yet it remains worthwhile viewing in spite of this.

16 October 2013,"Very successful dark and grisly, noirish murder mystery","If you simply read about what Seven is about you would be forgiven for thinking it sounded an incredibly hackneyed affair. A world weary detective a week from retirement is paired with a young hotshot colleague to work on a new case of grisly murders. They don't get on at first but once they get to know each other they begin to form a bond and prove to be a good team. This synopsis makes Seven sound like a generic buddy cop movie. And, to be fair, it is that to a certain extent. But fortunately the truth is in the detail.

Director David Fincher is a visual stylist and it's the look and feel of the movie that helps transcend it to another level. The setting is a nameless, hellish city where it seems to constantly be raining. There is a consistent feeling of impending dread. The visual elements of the film emphasises this. It goes for a dark neo-noir look, what with the rain and the shadowy interiors. The buildings all look like they are from a bygone era, while the men seem to dress like they are from a 40's film-noir - hats and trench coats are the order of the day, despite this clothing being completely out of fashion in the 90's. It's this attention to detail that gives Seven such an interesting look and feel.

Then we have the serial killings themselves. They have been staged to represent the seven deadly sins from the Bible. Each horrible death is targeted against someone who breaches one of the sins and their punishment is an elaborate and violent lesson against their transgression. It's a great set of crimes to base a detective film around. The mystery narrative progresses at first in a fairly traditional way but towards the end the rug is pulled out from under us and we enter unexpected territory. It's this unpredictability also that makes this a fine unconventional thriller. The principal actors are all very good, with a particular standout turn from Kevin Spacey towards the end. Spacey is very adept a doing 'cold' and here he is pitch perfect.

The story arc winds its way intelligently to an unforgettably nihilistic climax and Seven ultimately has to be considered one of the best serial killer films out there.",9
7 March 2022,Disturbing and brilliant!,"'Seven' is one of the most disturbing murder mystery films I've seen - not from a horror perspective, but on a psychological level. (Note, there are gore as well).

This is a phenomenal story based on the Seven Deadly Sins, as described in the Bible: Greed, Gluttony, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride, and Lust. A mysterious killer commits murders according to these sins, killing a person guilty of every one of these sins, in the most horrific ways.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman star as Detectives Mills and Somerset. Initially clashing, they are forced to work together with time running out. The film effectively creates suspense every step of the way. Be warned, some of the scenes are not for the faint of heart. They are seriously disturbing.

It's difficult telling the story without spoilers, so it is best to view it yourself, but choose your audience wisely if intended for a movie night. And who could ever forget THAT ending?! This is a brilliant film, and a stylish horror thriller that is bound to leave you in awe long after the credits have rolled.",8

14 July 2008,Great,"Seven (1995)

**** (out of 4)

Intense and rather disturbing thriller has Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman playing detectives trying to track down a serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his motive. I remember seeing this the opening day in theaters and I really left the theater disappointed. While I found it a good entertainment, it never really struck me as anything great until many years later on repeat viewings. Today I think the story, acting and directing makes it one of the best films of the decade. Fincher's dark style really creates a thick and rather eerie atmosphere, which runs from the opening to closing credits. The screenplay offers up a lot of tense action but I think the key to the film is the quieter moments where we get to know the two detectives as well as Pitt's wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow. When the killer's identity is finally revealed, and I won't ruin it here, the film even lets us get to know him in perhaps the most chilling scene in the movie. I think having the violence centered around the seven deadly sins was an interesting choice and the motives and conclusion could be endlessly debated. I guess it's to be expected that Freeman and Pitt would be opposite type of characters and the screenplay doesn't take the easy way out on this but instead it uses this to bring up the energy and we're able to see the killer from two different view points, which is a rare thing in thrillers like this. Both men give excellent performances with Freeman being the older, wiser man while Pitt is still wet behind the year but trying to make his mark in the profession. I know this film was a hit when originally released but it seems like it's become a classic over the past few years and I personally wouldn't argue with anyone calling this film that. I think it gets better with each viewing in the same sense that many Hitchcock thrillers get better.",
19 August 2013,The old meets the new...,"""Se7en"" is a movie which has to do with a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as method of doing these crimes. In this movie we have the outstanding interpretations of the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills, Morgan Freeman as Detective Lt. William Somerset and Brad Pitt as Detective David Mills.

This is a must see movie because it's a movie that it will keep you hooked and you will really love it. When I saw this movie for the first time I had reservations of this film, but when it finished I thought that it worth every second of it.

David Fincher did a great job in the direction of this film and that was pointed with the resonance in which had this movie and how people accepted and then loved this movie. David Fincher did a great start with ""Se7en"" and gave us a taste for the future films that followed and that will follow.

16 November 2012,For the wages of sin is death ...,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt).

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

29 October 2017,One of Fincher's Best,"Fincher finds a way to pace his movies so methodically and naturally, even in their ""slow"" moments, they stay completely captivating. Like a highbrow ""Saw"", this is a brutal and gross 90s crime thriller that plays beautifully on the very-real terror of ethical but evil people like the Unabomber, which was dominating national news and everyday American fear. And that final scene in the empty field is unbelievably great.

1 March 2012,Great crime thriller,"The seven deadly sins are used as a motive for a serial killer being tracked down by detectives Somerset(Morgan Freeman) and Mills(Brad Pitt).

The first victim killed is an obese man who represents gluttony. A wealthy attorney found dead is greed. Lust is an obvious choice, a prostitute murdered and raped. A beautiful model whose face has been slashed dies, pride is her great sin and all of the Catholic big seven are covered by the end of this very well written and thoughtful analysis of a sick mind.

Freeman and Pitt make a great pair, and Kevin Spacey is creepy as John Doe, the suspect. There is no easy solution and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen.

30 October 2016,A finesse of acting,"Seven is a detective movie of Brat Pitt and Morgan Freeman. This movie found a serial killer who killed people for their seven deadly sins. They are gluttony, sloth, pride, envy, greed, wrath, lust. Even the wife of Pitt was killed for the envy. The Killer John Doe used to envy the life of the detective Pitt that led to killing of his wife, Tracy in the morning when Pitt left the home for operation. The killer showed up and submitted in the police station with bloody hand and asked for lawyer and his help. However, he killed two other people that he wanted to show the detectives and took them to a barren high tension wiring places. Then a delivery van came and kept a box where Tracy's head was packed. In that morning, Doe killed her, she was pregnant. That misery Pitt could not afford and killed the Killer despite repetitive urge by Detective Somerset to stop firing. The quote of the Somerset is 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I like the second part'- Detective Somerset.

This movie hugely used the idea coming from Divine Comedy, Purgatory of Dante and Canterbury's Tales by Chaucer.",8
4 March 2014,"Se7en plus 2 = brilliant stay at home film, which is bound to shock and engross","Seven is the best example of story structure I've ever seen in film. Everything comes at the right time, in a script, brilliantly crafted by Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote an earlier draft in 1992, with a different ending, unlike the final one that jarred me, and left me open mouthed, haunting me for many nights later, if almost turning me off the movies. Cocky rookie cop, Brad Pitt and a more wise veteran detective (Freeman) work an out of the ordinary case, involving a killer, punishing people right down to the T, based on the seven deadly sins, some quite gruesome and graphic murders shown, led by excessive examples, sloth and gluttony, wrath and envy, the key to the finale of this nuts scenario. The brilliant performance from the very well respected actor playing our John Doe, I didn't recognizing until ten minutes later. You go into Seven, thinking it's just another serial killer movie, you come out, somewhat disturbed, jarred by it's none more shock ending, you'll never see coming, and it's great twenty minute lead up, which for some people who are easily disturbed, should steer away from. Freeman is solid here, where in many familiar start scenarios, here, he's just retiring from the department, when who should walk in, but cocky, arrogant, anger charged Pitt, in one of his best ever performances, where these two great actors were praised, warranted some acting stature. We have light hearted moments, ""meet the family"" scenes that worked well, amidst the mostly heavy and intense material, the John Doe chaser scene is awesome. Seven is flawless, I must say, it's opening theme to the song closer, that plays over haunting credits amongst disturbing and engrossing images, rocks, as does the closing soon, as a duly reminder as the consequences of those victim's sins. Put this is on your final bucket list of movies. Awesome cover poster.",9

4 October 2009,A murder mystery that offers more for the mind than mere thrills,"Murder mysteries don't often indulge their audience's intellectual capacity. They generally believe they can get by on suspense, intrigue and our inherent and insatiable need to find out 'whodunit.' But ""Se7en"" is a philosophical thriller that addresses a much bigger part of our nature - the age old question of whether or not humans are inherently evil.

As gripping as it is the way it turns gears in your head in search of any way to get mentally one step ahead of the plot, ""Se7en"" is a first-rate crime thriller because of the ideas fueling the story and a director in David Fincher who perfectly understands them.

More than a story of two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing murders based on the seven deadly sins, ""Se7en"" wants to be something bigger. It wants you to take a breather from figuring it out and chew on something a little more sophisticated, like say, human nature. The contemplative script by Andrew Kevin Walker gives us plenty of time for this as retiring Lt. Somerset (Freeman) and Det. Mills (Pitt) bicker over the killer's motives together or even have dinner at Mills' apartment. It's not just about the mystery and what psychology or ideals drive the killer -- those ideas echo throughout the film and even in these basic conversational scenes.

None of that would be communicated well, however, without Fincher (""Alien 3""). ""Se7en"" takes place in an unnamed rundown city, presumably in modern day, and that locational flexibility allows Fincher and whoever scouted locations the ability to film the movie in places that would better tell this story about human nature. The murder scenes take place in seedy, decrepit apartments -- all usually dark -- in attempt to tell a story of humanity in its darkest place, at it's very worst. Constant use of on-screen lights (e.g characters holding flashlights, red lamps, etc) give the film its signature while also extending the metaphor. It's the work of a director who understands the script through and through and has command of his vision.

The characters are also extremely sophisticated and believable as are the performances of the actors playing them. Freeman comes fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and absolutely dominates the pacing of the film. We take our cues on when to relax, when to get more curious and when to get passionate from his performance. On the verge of retirement, we see perfectly how this one life-changing case challenges his hardened world view.

Even Pitt's Mills, in his impatience, naivety and quick-tempered rebellious perspective, goes quickly from characteristics that feel a little forced to monumentally epiphanic near the climax. Pitt's taken on numerous roles in his career where we think we're getting the shells of a character role but we end up getting something meaningful after all.

That's sort of the way ""Se7en"" works on the whole. Before you can even realize it, you suddenly realize you've been watching a thoughtful two-hour sermon about mankind's true nature and its inclination toward evil with a large order of murder mystery on the side. Few thrillers give us the pleasure of meditating on such important ideas, in this case a question at the center of philosophy for hundreds if not thousands of years. ~Steven C

20 April 2022,What a terrific way to end a film!,"""Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part"".

What a terrific way to end a film, that was pretty shocking! And if truth be told, this particular element of 'Shock' is what made the entirety of the film work. And only through these startling moments, the film seems to shine the brightest!

The rest of it can be considered as the build-up; not much happens in this time frame but this is where the plot, one step at a time, makes its tinier advancements.

Other than Fincher's technical proficiency; what I admired the most was this dynamic established between Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman as well as the characters they play respectively. Not only was I able to connect to them at a personal level but I was also drawn to their investigative manoeuvres. Although, the same cannot be told about the supporting cast; as they hardly got any opportunities to develop as characters.

For example, towards the end, there's this character that meets a horrible fate (I won't give you the name); in that particular juncture, I was supposed to feel sympathetic toward this individual but I couldn't. Simply because that character (Still not giving out the name) merely had not more than ten minutes of screentime. I don't want to sound pretentious, so I'm gonna be very candid here; I didn't feel anything for that person, nor did I care.",7
30 March 2023,Just ok,"Unlike most of the general public, I am not enamored with this movie. It just doesn't do it for me. The acting is good, the direction, the cinematography, the ambience and atmosphere all just fine, it just isn't very compelling to me for some reason. And I love this genre of movie.

Over the years I've started watching this movie several times. This time I finally finished although it took a few sittings to finish the movie as it put me to sleep more than once.

ABOUT MY REVIEWS:

I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.

My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",6
18 December 2014,"Two homicide detectives must track down a serial killer who uses the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" as his guideline for his killings","Detective William Somerset's years as a homicide detective have come down to their last seven days. He has closed many a case, and we meet him as he encounters his last Young Detective David Mills has just transferred to the local police force as Somerset's replacement, and he shooting from his hip as soon as he walks into the first crime scene. Local police have found an extremely obese man dead in his house, and after a few minutes of investigating, the initially believed cause of death, brain hemorrhage, is soon replaced with murder. The two detectives conclude that the victim was forced to eat by his killer, and then kicked in the stomach. This is but our first taste (insensitive pun unintended) of the sick world that this story takes place in. Within 24 hours of this, a top-notch attorney is found dead in his office, and the word ""greed"" written into the carpet. On an inquiry of the first victim's apartment, Somerset finds the word ""gluttony"" carved into the wall behind the fridge. It does not take Somerset and Mills to realize that this unknown killer is systematically murdering his victims using the themes of the Seven Deadly Sins, which are: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. With the identity of the killer, and 5 more victims helplessly unaware of what is to come, detectives Mills and Somerset must find their man, and navigate the dark world that surrounds them.

If the first murder wasn't an obvious clue, this is a dark movie. The ""gluttony"" victim, and all of the other victims for that matter, is brutally executed, and most of the grisly remains are what we see. Though we do not see the murders themselves, there is little left to the imagination. In this aspect, this luridly-themed film took me to my limit, and perhaps past it. I would like to think that I can handle just about anything that a camera can show, but this film proved me terrifyingly wrong. Putting the murders aside, this film was very well put together. Freeman does a great job of playing the ""old vet"" archetype, and Brad Pitt as the young rookie is a well-cast role. Kevin Spacey as our ""John Doe"" makes the antagonist utterly sickening, which is exactly what director David Fincher wanted. From a cinematography standpoint, the film was well-shot, and the editing (Oscar-nominated) was very well done. I will leave you with a few key points that I feel I must emphasize. As a devout Christian, I found the killer's system very appalling, and I dearly hope that the public does not associate this with any Christian value. In case you did not pick this up in my previous notes, this film is DARK. I myself had to watch through my fingers at times, and I have no doubt that any future viewer will as well. The language in itself is R-rated, and it just adds to the dreariness. In his review of this film, the late film critic Roger Ebert began by saying "" 'Seven,' a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see film-making of a high order.""

The thrills did thrill, and the horrors did horrify, but I found it too far exposed. Though Fincher is known for his dark portrayal of life (Fight Club, I'm talking about you), this film took it past my favorable level.

10 May 2005,loved it,"i love this film, it is the ultimate thriller film, everything about se7en is brilliant. the cast are well picked and make the best contributions, the main characters Somerset and Mills are portrayed perfectly through Freeman and Pitt. in my opinion this is both Pitt and Freeman's best film, they still have not outshines there fantastic performances. Paltrow as mills wife was a good choice though there are a few other actresses that could have played this part, though i think that what paltrow brought to the role was the fragile emotional side of the character, so i am pleased that she played this part so well. the director is my favourite of all time, Mr David Fincher! he is a fantastic director, not just for this film but for his other films like fight club. he gets fantastic results from his cast and crew and makes the perfect film. and as i'm a budding editor myself i have to mention the fantastic edit on the film, by the editor Richard Francis-Bruce, i do love the edit on seven as he cut at hit points and generally did well.

4 June 2021,"Decades later, still one of the best neo-noir psychological crime thrillers! [+82%]","A rewatch many years later, Se7en still proves to be a very intense and benchmark psychological crime thriller. The buddy-cop chemistry that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share is built over several scenes in between the procedurals. Fincher, working off Andrew Kevin Walker's script, adds neo-noir visual flourishes (the use of climate, be it sun or rain, is superbly effective) and crafts elaborate scenes that allow emotions to sink in. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't as prominent a presence as the other two, but she adds the much needed sensitive heft. The crimes (or the crime scenes) themselves are gruesomely portrayed, not toning down their visceral nature one bit. Se7en isn't throwing these barbaric ideas at you just for the sake of cheap shocks - it gives the antagonist (played by Kevin Spacey) an arc of his own, and also lets viewers in on his ideologies in that intriguing pre-climactic car scene.

Freeman and Pitt are excellent, fitting their respective roles to the T. Somerset never showcases weakness, and this is attributed to all the years he spent in the city's most dangerous precinct, mostly by himself. He's well-read too, a trait that actually helps the duo get closer to the offender. Mills, on the other hand, is hot-headed and racy. He doesn't care about the depths of the crime - he simply wants to nab the bad guy and put him away. They play each other off perfectly. And Spacey, as much as he's despised now, embodies evil in a way that very few actors could. That he won the Academy Award (for his performance in The Usual Suspects, released earlier that year) makes all the sense in the world now.

What prompted me to revisit Se7en is the latest instalment in the Saw franchise - Spiral. The films share more similarities than I possibly imagined. In fact, I'd even go on to say that Spiral borrows more from Se7en than the Saw series itself. Put John Doe and John Kramer in a room and they'd make great conversationalists. The Little Things, the 2021 Denzel-Malek-Leto starter, is another film that immediately comes to mind. Both Spiral and The Little Things are inferior pieces, but I'm glad filmmakers are still interested in exploring the genre further.",8

16 September 2022,1 of My Fav's...,"So very good! I especially loved the ending when David (Pitt) is saying 'what's in the box'... don't close your eyes because you will actually see Tracy's (Paltrow) face, as the last image David saw of her. It's a brilliant and compelling cinematic move. It makes for really fun viewing because it's just a nano/split second, but once You see it - you can never unsee it. It stays with you forever. The whole film is wonderfully gritty and stands the test of time so well. We just viewed it again and realized how really classic it is. Take it in again... and I promise - you won't be disappointed. Bravo - David Fincher!

22 August 2020,My 2nd favourite movie of all time,"I remember walking out of the cinema at the end of this film in a daze, my brain incapable of computing the audacity it had been subjected to by the unhollywood ending and stylish bleakness on display for the previous couple of hours. It hits you like a sledgehammer and won't let go. I love a movie that makes you FEEL, and seven does that every time I've watched it in the 25 years since. It's not for the faint of heart or people who need to see a sunny outlook on humanity, it's far too real for that. Fantastic acting, pitch perfect direction and screenplay combine to make a true classic of cinema. If it passed you by in the 90s (or you weren't around then!)... give it a go, it has aged beautifully.

18 December 2018,Slow-simmering serial killer thriller from Fincher.,"My Rating : 8/10

Currently #21 on IMDb Top 250 so certainly a safe bet if you're looking for a thriller to watch. David Fincher makes some of the best thrillers and Se7en is one of his most iconic. Must watch for cerebral film lovers.

24 December 2009,Se7en out of Ten,"Two cops are after a killer who is choosing his victims based on each of the seven deadly sins. This pretty much sums up the plot. I highly doubt that director David Fincher is an amoral misanthropic person, but he does want his audience to be disturbed.

Se7en, is a good example of the right way to construct a thriller. It is potent and eerie, superbly crafted, nicely paced, even scary at times. The climax feels a little overly contrived as so many do, but I didn't feel cheated too badly. The movie ends on a bit of a funny note and when you stop to think about it, it leaves some things unexplained.

As far a cop buddies go, I can't say that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freemon make a great pair. A film like Se7en requires two lead actors of equal talent, and Pitt is no match for Freemon, although that is just my opinion.

Se7en is a movie that sinks its teeth in deep, and it provides enough fascination to keep a good viewer in his seat for the duration of two hours, but it is not a film for the religious, the squeamish or the weak of mind.",7

12 August 2020,"Pretty good, but overrated","Man, Kevin Spacey can play seriously creepy characters very well. His performance is excellent, though I'm not sure about Brad Pitt's (""what's in the boooxxxx?""). Gwyneth Paltrow's miniscule role is a complete throwaway, and Morgan Freeman is just kind of ... Morgan Freeman. It's an entertaining thriller but felt more than a little contrived at each step along the way, and to be honest, like pretty standard Hollywood stuff. I'm surprised it's as rated as high as it is.

16 March 2012,A Modern Crime Classic,"I think just about everyone who has seen ALIEN 3 can agree, it's pretty crappy. We should all be thankful that Hollywood had the foresight to realize that it's director David Fincher managed to show considerable talent and saved it from the ultimate train wreck it's long, problematic development meant it should have been. After throwing himself under the bus to complete ALIEN 3, Fincher was given the chance to prove what he was really capable of with SE7EN. The film is a modern classic and most people will agree. I love a good serial killer story, and SE7EN is right up there at the top of the list with the best of them. Thanks to it's gripping story, talented performances, and an ending that will go down as one of the most memorable, SE7EN is an excellent movie well-deserving of the long-term attention it's gotten and the status it helped to build for Fincher. In the film, Detective William Somerset is one week from his retirement and begins training his replacement, the younger and more naïve Detective David Mills. Mills is a hotshot with an impatient attitude, recently transferred from a small town to the big city where he hopes to make a difference. Mills' first case, and Somerset's supposed final, turns into something larger than your average homicide. A new serial killer has come to light and he is using torture and murder to preach against the seven deadly sins to his victims (e.g. an obese man is forced to eat himself to death at gunpoint).

This is a dark, twisted movie. From the very beginning we open with a warped credits sequence and a glimpse into the methods of the yet-unknown serial killer to the remixed sound of Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"". And it only gets more twisted from there. We never actually see the murderer (with the inconspicuous name John Doe) in action as the audience. Instead, we see the aftermath as Somerset and Mills arrive on the scene and each crime scene is more brutal than the last. John Doe is a psychopath and uses his victims to preach his message in the worst way possible. SE7EN is the most gripping serial killer/thriller since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and even now, almost twenty years since it's release, is just as powerful as always. While there may not be any brutal violence occurring on screen, I would still recommend discretion for audience members who don't care for the darker subject matter. Despite the fact the movie was released in 1995, I'll try to remain spoiler-free when discussing the movie just in case, but the end of this movie has been parodied and paid homage countless times since. It's a strong ending and I'm glad it didn't cop out and go the usual route where the killer is stopped before his crimes can escalate and the story ends on a high note. Not here; it's a bittersweet ending where you could even go so far as to say the villain triumphs over the heroes.

Every element of this movie contributes to its strength. The cinematography from Darius Khondji is amazing. The visual style of this movie is just as prominent as any performance. The high contrast, abundance of low lighting, overcast weather and sharp instances of source lighting (I really loved the red neon cross in Doe's apartment) gives this movie an overwhelming feeling of gloom that coincides with Detective Somerset's view on life in the city. I would love to get my hands on the screenplay from Andrew Kevin Walker for this one, as it's incredibly well written and was perfectly suited for the talents of someone as visually strong as director Fincher. The cast in this movie, again inspired. The only real important characters in the film are Somerset (Morgan Freeman), Mills (Brad Pitt), and the killer John Doe (who I won't spoil here on the off chance that someone reading this has not seen the movie and somehow avoided any and all revelations about Doe). Morgan Freeman is the kind of actor where you expect a powerful performance, and he delivers just that. Somerset is a jaded detective who's spent years on the force and seen it all (until Doe came along); he's tired and he's ready to find a simpler life. I've also got to give Pitt some great credit here because SE7EN was the movie that helped me realize Pitt was more talented than I'd believed and more than just a Hollywood pretty boy (further solidified in FIGHT CLUB, another awesome Fincher film). And finally, the actor portraying John Doe is excellent. Doe is a cold, calculating killer who truly believes in what he is doing and the actor gives one of the best eerie performances. All together, this all combines to create one of the best films of the 90s and almost guaranteed to become a favorite.",9
7 June 2016,"1, 2, 3, 4 . . . Anchored.","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9
29 January 2022,A perfect crime thriller,"Seven is a perfect crime thriller. It's impactful, thematic, suspenseful, and character-driven. It fully embraces its jaded worldview through gruesome content and a culminating conclusion. Morgan Freeman excels as a demoralized homicide detective. He displays flashes of buried optimism, but is deeply nihilistic. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt is an ideal counterpart. Young and energized, Pitt genuinely believes he can make a positive difference. While these two crack the grisly case, their relationship develops into a true friendship. The investigation is captivating, but their bond is Seven's core. Therefore, their vulnerability and authenticity are crucial to the film's success.

Furthermore, Seven is brilliantly enhanced by Fincher's filmmaking. First, the cold imagery often suggests rather than displays violence. This urges viewers to imagine the brutalities for themselves, which is far more haunting. The editing is slow and deliberate, masterfully mounting tension. The production design is gross and decrepit, underscoring the theme of moral decay. The effects are vividly shocking yet measured, always respecting the horror. Lastly, Fincher's direction flawlessly captures a grim tone, festering atmosphere, and methodical tempo. Thus, Seven is a transformation of its parts, a genuine piece of art, and utterly unforgettable.

Writing: 10/10 Direction: 10/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Acting: 10/10 Editing: 9/10 Sound: 8/10 Score/Soundtrack: 8/10 Production Design: 9/10 Casting: 10/10 Effects: 9/10

1 May 2017,Must see.,"It's very hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it so I need to keep it simple. Thinker/mind bender. Its insightful/disturbing nature is the only reason why I can see that it only has 8.6 rating. It's a movie you have to pay attention to. A movie you can watch over and over and always find something new. If you don't agree with that... watch it 5 years from now.

26 December 2018,Holy Hell.,"Se7en is a morbid, unrelenting thriller. It doesn't merely stare into the abyss, it jumps in. Two detectives, one rookie and one veteran, come across the worst murders they've ever seen, but such that are intricately designed, they know the killer is trying to prove a point. Freeman's character connects the dots to the Seven Deadly Sins as inspiration for the killings. Once they catch him, they come to find that he's as crazy as you'd expect, but more self-righteous than they would ever believe, and all along, the religious backdrop of these murders were intentional.

David Fincher is a master of the macabre and has become a household name for bleak films 23 years later. You can credit him for how deeply appalling the bloody crime scenes unfold for us. The little stories behind them, the production design.. Then we come to Kevin Spacey as the killer. Looking back now, it's a bit rich to see him play a man righteously outraged by a decaying American society and delivering his sick sense of street justice on sinners. Arguably, Spacey himself would have been among his victims. But perhaps even Spacey knows that, just as his character does here as well. Truth isn't just stranger than fiction, it's horrifying.",8
23 September 2022,Doesn't Get Much Better Than This One,"A magnificent thriller masterfully done by David Fincher. Fincher's understanding of serial killers and police work surrounding them is almost frightening. This one is engaging and revolting from Moment one. The acting by Freeman, Pitt, Paltrow is top notch. Great chemistry between them. Kevin Spacey, for all his flaws, is as good here as you will ever see. The last 30 minutes of this one are unmatched anywhere. This one hold up. Great movie. This movie has some disturbing images and some aspects that squeamish may find hard to take, but the end result is a movie that stood out and stands out as one of the top of its kind.

17 April 2019,"A movie on serial killing, that hasn't got old.","This master piece from Fincher came out in 1995 and is arguably the best movie on the subject till date.

The research carried out to plot this fictional account worth mentioning.

Narration and acting capture the place that is of top notch.

Finally the end leaves you speechless.

17 August 2018,A cult classic that didn't get the acclaim it deserved,"Voluntarily transferring in to a crime hotspot in an unnamed city of America, Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a rookie detective on the rise. He's teamed up with Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who's not far away from retirement. They end up on a case investigating murders that follow a pattern and are inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins from Dante's ""The Devine Comedy"". Somerset is an expert in hunting down criminals and does things the old-fashioned way through years of working hard, due to looming retirement and a desire to stay alive he doesn't want to get involved too heavily - his years and the weariness they have brought him suggest that there is more going on than just another killer on the loose. Mills on the other hand wants to make a name for himself and pushes the case and his involvement. They fall out a little, it takes a meeting with Tracy Mill (Gwyneth Paltrow - Pitt's film wife) to convince Somerset that he has to be involved, if nothing else than to guide and protect Mills. Thus they pursue the murder, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) who has planned a shock for the detectives.

Directed by David Fincher and wonderfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this is a fantastic intelligent and gripping film, a real cult classic and one of the iconic films of the 90's. It's dark and dirty with a fantastic atmosphere. The unnamed American city is a real hive of filth and degradation, it's always raining, and even when you are away from the rain the colour palette is muted, dark and dirty. The acting is top class all the way across the board. While having a new rogue cop and one close to retirement isn't a new set-up it works particularly well in this and Pitt and Freeman end up bouncing off each other beautifully. The score to the movie is great and really helps to build up the atmosphere and bring in a level of tension that chills. Editing techniques used are both new and existing, some a direct homage to absolute greats of horror movies, in particularly the hidden cell insertion (a-la ""The Exorcist"" for example) - a frame or picture hidden in the visual reel and only displayed for a fraction of a moment. The look and feel of the film harp back to noir classics or even graphic novel comic books the way it's all dark and gloomy, and while it's set as an action/suspense/thriller there are nods to horror too, both psychologically and physically, with the manner of killings which take place adding a grizzly and raw element. Well-paced and almost metronomal, this film will keep you entertained throughout - in fact the most peaceful time the film allows is when the detectives themselves are having a break from action. This is a feature of the film, it stays on track and focussed throughout and unlike conventional Hollywood films it never strays from it plot and purpose. The audience plays a part in the film as the third detective, in that they are kept in the dark throughout and only really learn things as the detectives learn, which allows for an intense ride and lifts the finale onto a pedestal. Not your typical cops and robbers' film this will take you out of your comfort zone and take you into a brutal world, and who knows, you might end up questioning your morality and empathising or sympathising with the killer's motives.

This film didn't win half as many awards as it should have done - but thankfully its cult status and fan recognition have kept it alive in film history consciousness. 9 out of 10 from me.",9
21 November 2020,Preparation for Mank: SE7EN is one of the best sophomore films in the history of cinema!,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

I've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don't believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I've ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher's remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher's movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.

I've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven't seen it in so long that I didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I've ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions... it's so mesmerizing that I'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.

One of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the ""seven deadly sins"", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.

The gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.

I'm keeping this review spoiler-free because I don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That's why I'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I'll get there). Fincher's third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.

Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.

Technically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.

Movies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.

Se7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made.... I can't recommend it more.

10 February 2015,This was fantastic!,"Uh do I remember time when I saw this film for the first time! I think the most memorable part of it will be Morgan Freeman. That man just did a role of his life with that film! I was very impressed with the plot. For a police thriller this was very ingenious plot, with many twist and turns, jumpy and sad moments. I remember when I and my ex wife watched this film we were very depressed for that evening in style why do people have to be that way?

Altogether, if you did not see that film , I would strongly recommend that you see it. Very rarely thriller can be so smart and interesting at the same time, and this is the case here.

Also, it is probably Morgan Freeman*s role of life!

15 September 2015,scary crimes,"In America, one day, a dead man is found in an unusual style. He is surely obesity, and the reason for his death is that he is forced to keep eating food. Near the dead body, there is a message from him, saying ""GLUTTONY"". Then, two detectives stand to solve the incident, but it doesn't end. Similar murders happens repeatedly, and the victims always tell them some messages by writing. It has seven crimes according to the title, but how will it go to the end? I thought it is very shocking, and has a lot of scenes that makes us surprising. For me, I can watch, because I like that kind of mystery, but some people might be struggle watching it. Anyway, I am surprised by its end!

21 May 2008,Se7en - a second viewing 13 years later,"Thinking back, I do believe this was my first 18 certificate film I watched at the pictures and it left a real impression. It's always been a favourite even though for some inexplicable reason I have only seen it just the once.

So it was with some trepidation that I bought the 2-disc DVD on ebay recently and decided to watch it the night before last. I wondered if knowing the dramatic outcome already would spoil the viewing pleasure of what goes before.....It didn't.

I wasn't wrong as a 15 year old in my assumptions that it was the best thriller I'd ever seen and while I've seen some great films over the last 13 years I'm pleased to say that this one is right up there with the best of them. It's also weird how I seemed to remember every single detail from every scene, even with my notoriously dodgy memory.

I just can't fault this flawless film, Fincher was on top of his game here and it's definitely my favourite of his and I am a fan of Fight Club",10
5 April 1999,Astounding.,"My favorite thing in film is atmosphere. Once a film has set a tone for its story, I am completely hooked. Seven is a very disturbing film, for some too disturbing. Anyone who has seen Seven though doesn't deny it's ability to leave you with a strange feeling or leave you thinking about it for days afterwards. David Fincher is a very talented director. I thought his Alien 3 film was much more powerful than other people I know and here Fincher shows he has talent. The mood is set from the very beginning, especially the credit sequence. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt become their characters and the film pulls you into its universe. It makes you feel scared, it makes you think. How many films will you see that will make you talk and think in your lifetime. The cinematography by Darius Khondji is amazing and the set design is beautiful. David Fincher has made a very memorable film, one you will never forget.

8 May 2016,Best cinematic murder mystery of all time,"Se7en tells the harrowing story of 2 detectives trying to find a brutal serial killer who bases his horrific killings on the seven deadly sins. Se7en is, in my mind, the best detective movie ever made and here's why. This is one twisted, messed-up and depressing movie, but it's not unwatchable. It's actually hugely entertaining, it's got two amazing set-pieces and it's a compelling, unpredictable story. Many other movies which feature such a terrifying antagonist are often really hard to watch, but here the film works as a blockbuster still. David Fincher's direction is flawless, the cinematography is amazing and the city in which the film takes place is a truly disturbing environment. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are outstanding (Even Gwyneth Paltrow is quite good here) and their characters feel like humans, not just like actors. This is first and foremost a study of evil, but it doesn't shove its themes down our throats. This explores its nihilistic concepts with art and subtlety, so that the relentlessly harrowing subject matter doesn't get in the way of characters and action. Best of all, this has one of the greatest movie endings in the history of cinema, and for that alone it's worth watching. A truly great movie, which holds up very well on a re-watch, and is one of my favourite films of the 90s.

18 March 2015,One of the best thrillers of all time with a shocking ending that will smack you in the face.,"Se7en (also known as Seven) is one of the best thrillers that everyone still talks about. It's certainly not a clichéd movie nor does it use a recycled plot. It is well written with an original plot and the cast is brilliant. The entire movie is suspenseful and dark with its shock value added to keep audiences engaged. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, John C. McGinley and Kevin Spacey are excellent.

Set in an unnamed city which rains for most of the movie, Se7en is about a serial killer who's M.O. is based around the seven deadly sins. The seven deadly sins are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Morgan Freeman is Detective Lieutenant William Somerset, a worn out homicide detective on the verge on retirement. Somerset is partnered with newly transferred Detective David Mills played by Brad Pitt, an idealistic yet brash and hot headed police detective. Somerset and Mills are tasked with the investigation as the gruesome murders pile up one at a time. The serial killer who calls himself John Doe, played by Kevin Spacey, leaves inconspicuous clues on the next victim as well as his identity. Meanwhile David Mills' wife Tracy is unhappy with the move to the city and confides to Somerset that she is miserable here. Somerset and Mills must race against time to find John Doe as well as any further victims.

Brad Pitt shows that he is a versatile actor and not just a pretty face as the brash Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is tailor made as the world weary Detective Lieutenant William Somerset who wants to solve this case before his retirement. Gwyneth Paltrow makes her mark as David's wife Tracy, who reluctantly agrees to transfer to the city with her husband. Kevin Spacey is chilling as the calculating John Doe. Kevin Spacey's John Doe earns a spot as one of the best villains of all time. R. Lee Ermey, famous for his role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, does a good job as the unnamed Police Captain. John C. McGinley also does a good job as the hard charging SWAT Team Leader California.

Se7en is notable for putting director David Fincher on the map, making critics and audiences stand up and take notice that he is a force to be reckoned with. After his disastrous debut with Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher does a brilliant job with Se7en. David Fincher would later go on and direct further movies that would cement his reputation as a brilliant director with movies such as The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Social Network (2010), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), and Gone Girl (2014). David Fincher, along with writer Andrew Kevin Walker and cinematographer Darius Khondji should be commended on a job well done for bringing to the screen a dark, gratuitous and grim thriller. The entire movie does not let up for one moment, and the shocking ending just smacks you in the face. The best part is that the ending is unexpected and NOBODY could tell you that they saw it coming. If anyone says that they could see it coming, they are full of it. The shocking ending in Se7en is one that will stay with you for days, and it certainly did when I first saw it many years ago.

Although Se7en is a grisly and gory movie that is certainly not for the faint hearted, it rightfully earns its spot as one of the best thrillers of all time, and definitely one of the most popular movies of the 1990's.

3 February 2021,World can be a brutal place to be; sometimes we have to deal with things that we rarely expected in our life,"What worked: This movie is one of the most satisfying but at the same time disturbing movies in recent times, which has been highly appreciated by most. It's a very well written screenplay, great dialogues and captivating narrative. It's well balanced movie with right references to humor, psychology, philosophy, and life in general. Must say one of David's best work, if not the best. Morgan and Brad were a great combo team, both equally charming in their roles. Kevin landed a great role, and worked on his favor for a long time. The movie had a fantastic finale, and as the movie said, will be remembered for years to come and researched. I think as we watch the movie multiple times, as I did, we learn something new, something about self and something about the society, that at first movie movie viewing might not have made sense. What did not work: Although it's a very finely written piece of work, some more focus on minute details would have reduced the loopholes to very few. Final verdict: highly recommended

14 May 2013,A wonderful thriller,"There is no crazier movie in the 90s that can cause to feel uneasy like the way Se7en did. Seven used imagery and your ability to imagine the insanity level of the perpetuator, to thrill you. The whole idea of using a gore scene to take majority of the movie's screen time and then satisfy the weird nature of some viewers was totally eliminated and the movie just focused mostly on character development which many may see as boring but it (the movie) still carried on to be a masterpiece. When you see the way the co-stars interact you will just bow in respect to their mastery of acting. Morgan Freeman played the old father figure and a detective who has seen too much of the streets and is so eager to retire and leave it all behind, while Brad Pitt played the younger cop, who is full of energy and is ready to jump off roof tops and chase down bad guys. The movie also made use of an array of supporting actors that are very good on their own to star in a film, actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Kevin Spacey, were also onboard in this thriller.

Seven features the newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the soon to retire William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) as homicide detectives who become deeply involved in a case about a sadistic serial killer whose accurately planned murders corresponding to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy.

The movie's name is seven but it is mostly characterized by Se7en and it is a most see in many levels. The thrill that the movie brings and the chemistry of the co-stars is one that you will not just find lying around in any movie. Seven became the first of 3 films that director David Fincher and actor Brad Pitt did together (that is as of now 2013) the others were The Fight Club (1999) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).

The movie was a massive hit in the 90s and it was a both a critical and a commercial success as the 30 million budget brought in over 327 million in the box office. Andrew Kevin Walker received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and the editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an Academy Award for Film Editing. Seven won the MTV movie award as the best film in its year.

If you haven't seen Seven before or you are in the mood of another fun thrilling ride as we chase down Kevin Spacey, then make time to see this movie again.

29 June 2022,Crazy,"""Se7en"" is great, I loved the grotesque atmosphere of the film. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt do wonderful jobs as the main characters. There were a lot of plot points that unraveled in such a satisfying way thanks to the terrific pacing of the film. This is one of those movies where the less you hear about it before watching it, the more powerful the impact. And it provides some interesting commentary on mental illness.

Definitely worth watching.

20 January 1999,Blew my mind!,"Seven is not your standard serial killer on the loose film. It is a dark, grimy, visceral thriller that chills you to the bone days, months and years after you've seen it. The crimes that John Doe perpetrates in this film grow more and more atrocious as the film progresses, and we can't help but watch. It's a glimpse into ourselves. We find these events horrible, but at the same time we wonder what could push someone to acts such as these? That's where Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman come in. They provide the questions that we as an audience are afraid to ask. They doggedly pursue the killer in an attempt to stop him. The film ratchets up the tension and only in the final act of the film do we meet John Doe. Kevin Spacey is absolutely chilling. So calm, so cold and so damn intelligent. The ending knocked me out.

21 February 2005,An Eulogy of 'Seven': The modern Shakespearean tragedy,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9
9 August 2015,Se7en (9/10),"Seven, also known as Se7en, is headlined by a brilliant all-star cast, which include Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, R. Lee Emery and Gwyneth Paltrow. The cast being near perfect, would not have been together if it wasn't for the stellar script and lead director, David Lynch. David Lynch film-making was ruthless creating a dismal atmosphere, always raining, with crummy settings in dark places.

The film probably considered by most a thriller crosses the line into the horror genre with chilling scenes and grotesque images. The suspense is top-notch having a first time viewer on the edge of their seat from the start. When the film does end, the viewer is left with a shocking twist, stirring up a few emotions that aren't often felt when watching a movie. Viewers may bicker if Se7en can be labeled as a horror film or not but what they won't argue is the greatness, being the film itself.

17 March 2022,Frighteningly beautiful thriller,"I watched Se7en assuming it would be a regular detective movie. I am happy to say that I have been proven wrong to a great degree. First off, I'd like to gush over how perfect the cinematography is for this movie. The intense downpour of rain present throughout (most of) the movie adds so much to the noir atmosphere the film evokes. The lighting is quite minimal throughout the movie. This choice was obviously made to create a more claustrophobic and creepy ambience and I would say it works. Howard Shore's score is not too noticeable in the film, it does add tension and in the final act it does help with freaking out the viewer even further.

The disgusting murders shown in this movie are what set it apart from other crime/thriller films. Not to spoil anything, but the people who made this were certainly creative. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are beautifully cast here. The best way to see this movie is completely blind like I was, so I won't give anything away.

This movie is definitely not one to forget and is a must-watch.

10 January 2000,Wonderful darkness,"Dark, evil tale of a killer using the 7 deadly sins as grounds. The cops on his tail are always one step behind and get to witness the unbelievable cruelty that the murderer has inflicted upon his victims. No compromise: this is the most evocative film to appear in recent years, and I bet the ending had Andrew Kevin Walker bouncing up and down shouting: ""I'm the king of the world"" too. Fantastic.

11 May 2015,If Lethal Wepon Was Realistic,"I think the greatest strength of Se7en is its opening twenty minutes. The first twenty minutes makes you think that you're in for a decent, gritty, detective movie. But nothing worth the 250. It's sort of what Summerset and Mills thinks they're getting into. They think that this is going to be a hard case, but not scarring. They keep their heads high and don't think much of it. But after those twenty minutes, it becomes a tale of self worth, moral ambiguity, guilt and everything that'd usually be fluff in any other movie, turned into a disturbing look into what we can and have become as a species.

The film is hard to write about because it does everything in a bad buddy cop movie and makes it realistic. How would Mel Gibson and Danny Glover function outside of the job? How would the world react to absurd James Bond like plans? How would a basically criminal master mind make his plans make sense? The film is like a satire that went all of the way. It makes everything that'd be nonsense in any other film, and I mean any other film, work. The dialogue works, the acting, the camera, the story, the plan, the makeup, everything works. And the best part is, you don't expect it to. By all means, this film should've been awful, and it's brilliant.

This the first time I'm truly recommending a movie. Unlike a lot of good movies, this one you want to suggest to others. It's hard to recommend something like The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or Citizen Kane because of one reason or another. It's too long, some things don't make sense, but Se7en is a film that's enjoyable and for reasons that can't be explained. It's a watchable movie.

The only problem is also the greatest strength. The first twenty minutes are a bit, well, ""slow"" because they're necessary and without it the film wouldn't work on an emotional or logical level. But, even then, it so much more watchable than a lot of other first twenty minutes. It's a ""good movie"" no matter what.

If nothing else, everything about this film WORKS. What that means, I still don't know. But it's a working movie and make of that what you will. Please, watch this movie.",9

21 May 2015,Oh spacey you slay me!,"This was an awesome movie! Spacey should have won an Oscar he was devilishly cruel and good! Even Brad Pitt had a stellar outing in this as the young cop with something to prove, beautiful lady at home etc.. Morgan Freeman as the smart older and on the verge of retiring cop but is pulled back in for this one last case.. is excellent. Its a shame this didn't receive more Oscar attention. It really found its groove later on I suppose as a classic. Not recommended as a family film has a lot of violence as its a take on the 7 deadly sins. Overall this movie was a 10 for me the cast the directing the story line was dynamite! Well worth a watch a time or two!

11 February 2004,Excellent,"This great thriller is about a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) and his Se7en victims who represent the Se7en deadly sins. Two cops (Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt) have been assigned to investigate this case.

This is the best movie of the 90's, it has great thrilling moments, Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitts performances are excellent. Se7en has one of the best but shocking and surprising endings of all time. The end is something nobody would expect, i kept rewinding over and over again to see them 3 short seconds where you see... (im not going to spoil the movie).

Kevin Spacey's role in this movie was a surprise for everyone, well except for the people who use IMDB, it said who the killer was played by.

The most shocking moment for me was when you see that body on the bed and everyone thinks that person is dead because of the state of the body, but its not, that scene shocked me alot, i never forgot it and never will.

Overall i gave Se7en 9/10, everyone that likes thrillers should go see this movie, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",9

4 October 2022,Good film,"Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt made a great team in this movie. I really liked the dynamics of their characters, with one being the mature and intelligent one while the other is younger and more reckless. The movie wouldn't have been as entertaining if both characters had similar personalities. And watching this in 2022, I really liked how Freeman's character was written; he had experienced the vicissitudes of life and that made him wiser.

The plot was good and gripping and I enjoyed the pacing of it as well. The crimes were very violent in nature but luckily they weren't too explicit. And for something that was filmed in the 90s, the special effects were amazing. The ending was shocking and it was interesting to see how each character reacted to the situation.

Overall, it was a good movie.

21 July 2022,Almost everything is perfect about this film.,"Se7en.

Two homicide detectives tracking down a sadistic serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as motives for his horrible crimes .

David Fincher's Se7en is a reference for everyone trying to make a good noir movie because this one is perfect ,

The brightest spotlight in this masterpiece is the screenplay for me ,I haven't watched such as a well-written movie for a long while , the story is interesting ,a sadistic criminal following a pattern and having motives for his crimes , the process of investigations was thrilling with deep dialogs and the most important thing is the plot twist that will make you realize how iconic Se7en is!

David Fincher did a great job , his well filmed scenes delivers the mysterious atmosphere and the thrilling one, but the last scene is to be taught .

Obviously ,acting performance were as solid as directing and writing , I loved the young detective Brad Pitt ,and I felt the same with the reasonable aged detective Morgan freeman .

The chemistry between the two was enough to keep me watching the film , the age difference was a great detail that made me enjoy their conversations , I was missing Morgan's voice by the way!

I kept this masterpiece as long as I could without watching it ,I knew I'll admire it ,I wasn't ready for this consistent story that's dramatically strong and breathtaking until one of the greatest endings pop up.

""William Somerset: Ernest Hemingway once wrote, ""The world is a fine place and worth fighting for."" I agree with the second part.""",10
18 March 2022,A damn good movie,"Seven is a crime, thriller following a rookie and a hardened, retiring detective as they try and solve the case of the mysterious murders, one per day for Seven days, finding that the victims also follow a pattern, they all represent one aspect of the seven deadly sins. The duo must find this killer before he finishes his grand masterpiece.

I love this movie, the grimy and dark atmosphere, almost rustic in nature. Beauty in imperfection. David Fincher is a masterful director, choosing to rely on the weight of the scene, allowing it to hold, over fast cuts and fancy camera movements. The movie hooks you in most with it's disturbing nature, everything is so graphic and or disturbing in context. Right there, seeing what the detectives sees, trying to solve this puzzle with them.

But outside of that, the story is simple yet deals with complex ideas, while also keeping it in a 2 hour runtime, which is impressive, knowing how long it needs to be and not over staying it's welcome.

The only real issue i had with the movie is that i didn't feel that much of a connection as much as i should have to the story, until John Doe finally comes into the picture. From there, the movie is tense and had me hooked the entire time, the building music and the overall feeling that the characters are not in control. This is Fincher's true start into cinema. Though i prefer fight club and zodiac, this is by far his best original project.",8
25 February 2017,"""A dark thriller set in a dark and disturbing world""","As the title of the movie suggests , there are 7 sins and watching a masterpiece ain't one of them. This movie has everything,a wonderful and a talented cast, a great director and the center of it,a story. It has a Gothic horror movie vibe to it but at the core it's a psychological thriller.This movie isn't for the faint-hearted as it contains a few disturbing scenes.

2 December 2007,Se7en,"Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light ... (John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book II. Line 432)

""Seven deadly sins, seven ways to die"" is the tag-line for this intense psychological thriller directed by David Fincher:

~ Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) is set to replace Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a world-weary cop retiring after years on the force. Somerset can see no end to the harrowing crimes he has witnessed, the sickness that is the City. Dealing with murder, rape, abuse, and poverty has become the Lieutenant's life and he now hopes for some small shred of peace. Mills, on the other hand, is new to the city; he is arrogant and brash, having little time for Somerset's thoughtful and analytical techniques.

As retirement beckons, so a new spate of killings begin. Like it or not, Somerset is given the investigation by the Captain (R Lee Ermey) while Mills is put on a different case. The murders are soon linked to the same killer - a twisted genius who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins in Dante Alighieri's 'The Divine Comedy' - and Mills and Somerset are paired together once more.

Despite their clash of personalities Mills and Somerset strike up a good partnership, Somerset's introspectiveness and Mills's self-confidence turning out to be a useful combination. Each one learns a lot from the other; indeed, Mills's wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) thinks Somerset is a good influence on the husband she is rapidly growing concerned about.

It soon becomes apparent that the 'sins' killer is playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the detectives, enjoying watching them either stumble or succeed at every turn in the case ... while he continues to kill according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. They must stop him before he can finish his murder spree and most probably disappear forever ~ Se7en is not only the most accomplished film by David Fincher (Zodiac) but almost certainly - from a writing and directing viewpoint - the best psychological thriller in the history of film and television. There are none of the stereotypical clichés found in countless thrillers of violence, no room for the predictable, for the viewer is kept constantly in the dark until the very end. And the climax is both ferocious and awe-striking ... for once Hollywood kept the outcome a secret until the day of release, not an easy thing to do.

Whatever vision Andrew Kevin Walker had before he took his script to screenwriter David Koepp (Secret Window) was ultimately realised once in the hands of David Fincher. Fincher's dark and rain-driven sewer, his city of sins, has yet to be matched on film. His choice of cast was spot-on. Se7en is a true classic, crossing genres like crime, horror, thriller and police procedural ... dark and moody, harrowing and painful, Se7en will appeal to the darker side within us all.

Co-stars John C McGinley as California (captain of SWAT team)

Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.",10
22 February 2018,Brutal..,"I guarantee this film haunts you after you finish it. A very worthy movie to watch as this kind of movies happens rarely. I advise light-hearted to stay away from this flick as it contains extreme violence and may find it emotionally disturbing. Among the thousands of movies I watched, I would credit this film with the scariest ending.

8 September 2022,Whats in The Box?,"When Se7en was first released, it was viewed as nothing more than a ""gorey shocker"". Today, it's considered a classic. This was the film that put David Fincher on the map. Alien 3 was technically his first film, but it was awful and he barely had any control over it. He stated that he would rather have brain cancer than make another film at the time. But thank God he continued. He was a born master with his signature perfectionist filmmaking. The performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are exceptional. They played off each other so well. Especially during the scene where they talk about apathy. The dialogue in said scene was incredible. This film also contains one of the best finales in cinematic history. Right up there with Whiplash. Se7en is yet another one of my favorite films of all time.

20 April 1999,"Brilliant, horrifying nihilism.","Let me say at the outset that I am not a great admirer of David Fincher as a director. Alien3 was far too dreary and bleak, while The Game seemed to be a hollow,if stylish, exercise in manipulation. Having said that, I must register my admiration for Se7en. It was both absolutely terrifying and thought -provoking. The cinematography, the acting,and script were all superb. Morgan Freeman is indeed one of the world's greatest actors, while Brad Pitt does a great job as the slow-witted, dogged, arrogant young cop. (Perhaps because his own personality in real life is so similar.) However, the revelation is the performance by the actor playing ""John Doe"" . I will not give his name, as that would help give away the plot Having sung se7ens praises, why do I call it ""nihilistic""? For one thing, the overall tone of the film is one of dread and despair. But much more importantly, Se7en boasts one of the most terrifying endings of any film I have ever seen. It makes the ending of Chinatown seem like the ending of It's a Wonderful Life.

9 May 2004,Absolutley Brilliant,"After every great review of ""Se7en"", I knew I just had to see this movie. I was greatly impressed with this exciting thriller. The beginning was starting a little rocky for me, but everything came in just right. Almost perfect, I really loved this movie. Everything about it. The acting, the sets, the effects. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are amazing in the film with the fine cameo of Kevin Spacey as John Doe.

Even though I knew what would happen at the end due to everyone telling me. But I was still more than into this film. I'd recommend this highly.

10/10

7 March 2023,Ending was dumb,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",3
16 April 2014,MY REVIEW: It will be Eighth Sin not to Watch This!!,"Se7en. An unpredictable serial killer plot, the great storytelling of ace director David Fincher, performed by always reliable Morgan Freeman, star actor Brad Pitt and if it was not enough Kevin Spacey who does not how to do bad acting, all these give you one of the darkest and chilling thriller of all time. From the word go, you find yourself solving the case with two detectives played by Morgan and Brad. At one moment, they are very near to solve the case and then everything is turned upside down with a heartbreaking climax. Another movie that comes this close to perfection in serial killer plots is another David Fincher classic Zodiac. Gwyneth Paltrow as Brad's wide does well in her small part and provides lightness to otherwise heavy setup. Se7en although questioning the morality still maintains the good side of morality. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Se7en. You will enjoy it best when seen in total silence or undisturbed environment. If you love to be thrilled, then don't miss it!!

7 April 2022,The timepiece that never dies.,"I consider this film to be a cradle and inspiration for every filmmaker who presents crime and mystery cinema.

This is a film that should not be re-presented in any way, but I hope that there will be a new part for it and we will see after years what the investigators have reached and how they are facing crime in our time.

The Seven Sins are still present among humans and the movie must present us with a new masterpiece with a new part and with the same weight.

9 December 2021,Defies convention,"Seven is a classic at this point, but it never started as such. There was a lot of pushback from the studio, from actors who turned down the lead roles, deeming the script 'too dark'; and from the marketers at New Line, who understandably didn't know how to sell such a horrific enterprise to the masses. The reality is that this film is no more or less violent than a zillion schlock horror movies that preceded it - it's just that it is so well done, so effective in its narrative, and so psychologically devastating that the resulting film is more horrific in scope than most anything ever made before it, or since.

It seems the jury is still out on where this film takes place. New York and Chicago have been posited, but there are no discernible landmarks to tie it to either of these cities. Philly maybe. I think there's nowhere else such a dark, sordid tale could be taking place other than where they shot it: Los Angeles, and there are street signs which don't even bother to hide the true location. Sure, the film is drenched in perpetual downpour rather than the typical sunny Cali atmosphere, but this movie isn't as much about the reality of a location as it is about the evil it documents; something which could only be illustrated with a heightened, dank atmosphere, where the characters seem to all be drowning in an encroaching sorrow.

David Fincher's early whack as a director produced something original and sublime. The cliché buddy cop film is turned on its head by having seasoned detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and his green partner Mills (Brad Pitt) do away with their opposing roles early on, as they simply sink into procedural necessity. The detective characters become equals much faster than is expected, as they are thrown into a task of having to unravel the crimes of a certain John Doe (? You all know by now who this is), hopefully before the serial killers 'masterpiece' is concluded, and more victims are tallied.

Of course, this doesn't happen. What remains most haunting about this film is how uncompromisingly dark it is, how gritty it was allowed to be, how hopelessness is turned into an elegiac statement on evil, loss and death. The score of the film, by Howard Shore, is less remembered than the opening sequence by Trent Reznor - which spurred a great collaboration between a director and a musician - but Shore's contribution here shouldn't be discounted, as it perfectly captures the mournfulness of this story, and and the inevitably of its conclusion.

Se7en is the movie which proved David Fincher is an exceptional filmmaker. He has made some pretty hardcore films. Se7en remains his grittiest, most memorable, most uncompromising. Thankfully the studio and marketing guys didn't get their way, or it could have ended up just like a million other detective movies.",10
18 August 2016,"Good, but not very good IMO","First off let me say that the direction and acting is very good. I don't recall having any major complaints and can't recall many minor complaints. To me this film just didn't have a 10 out of 10 script which is why I give it 8 stars. For me, the story is the most important part of just about every film. This movie's story was very good for the most part. However I had 2 big complaints. 1: for the first murder, they mention receipts for the food he bought. They mention that there was food bought twice the same day. Why didn't the cops investigate the store on the receipt and see if there was any video footage from either/both purchases? 2: I was able to predict the end right before it happened, which really is less than ideal when it was clearly meant to be a shock. I might have ranked the film higher if I hadn't just watched: Witness for the Prosecution. And that film pulls off the surprise ending better and more dramatically than just about any other film. So I had a high bar of expectation prior to seeing the film and I had really high hopes for 7, seeing how it has an 8.6 ranking. I think following my viewing i won't leave as a fan or hater of the film. I managed to see a lot of impressive components in the piece, and it's still well worth a viewing if you can handle the disturbing content. And maybe I was a rare case in predicting the end.",7
7 August 2022,Superb movie,"Magnificent detective thriller, served by a dream cast with Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey among others plus a concrete script, and all this together makes it an exceptional movie a must.

19 May 2020,Cinematic mastery: Finchers knows HOW to tell stories visually. This is made by a master.,"I was, like many, initially hooked. This is for sure a movie one HAS to see fullscreen in cinema or at least a PRETTY good beamer. Why? Because in this one, the cinematography is SO intense and subtle, follows the actors just RIGHT and pre-dicts certain actions - one has to appreciate this power on a large canvas. And this is also what I personally loved about this film the most. The overall powerful camera movements and the pace that these create. Slow, fast, bodyless or shaky. Virtuously used. Also, the always high contrast between light and shadow create this intense atmosphere.

Usually I am everything but NOT into criminal stories because they seem so predictable, but the way the story was TOLD really got to me. (not the story itself necessarily). The episode in the library, illustrated with classical music - or the invasion of the murderer's home base with its super-dark and sadistic vibe (the LED cross on the wall...wow wow wow!) or the worn-down flat of the more dead than alive Victor with tons of paper-trees (used for cars and better smell)... these are images that will always stay with me. They really got to my heart.

So, again. Fincher is a MASTER in telling stories. Not necessarily great stories themselves, but also the way he TELLS THEM... make them really sublime. After the really intense and complex FIGHTCLUB, this is my second favorite movie made by Fincher. Love, love, love.",9
13 August 2023,One of the best Crime-Drama films of all time,"""Se7en"" has left a lasting impact on the thriller genre, influencing subsequent films with its dark tone, intricate storytelling, and exploration of the human psyche. Its thematic depth and thought-provoking content have contributed to its status as a cinematic masterpiece.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman deliver compelling performances as the detectives with contrasting worldviews. Pitt's portrayal of the young and impulsive Mills is a striking contrast to Freeman's composed and introspective Somerset. Their interactions add depth to the film's exploration of morality and human nature.

Kevin Spacey's portrayal of the meticulous and enigmatic killer, John Doe, is haunting. Spacey's understated performance adds to the character's chilling presence, making Doe a formidable antagonist who is not driven by personal gain but by a twisted sense of morality.",10
16 October 2009,You will commit the 8th sin if you don't watch 7,"David Fincher of Se7en, The Game, Fight Club and recently the Curious Case of BB! What could you need more to get you into watching Seven if you haven't yet?! Ah, let me guess, probably you'd need Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. What else, let me see, hmmm what about the great Kevin Spacey (come on Spacey of Americna Beauty, L.A. Confidential, Usual Suspect, 21 and his first and best Seven). Now, add to all that 7 sins which means 7 murders and not only that you need to guess what are the 7 sins because many people have watched it, loved it, praised it but when I asked them who was the 7th victim, they simply didn't know the answer. Count the people murdered in the movie once more and you will know what I am talking about. This movie is, simply and in one word, just amazing.

4 December 2021,Remarkable ending to an overall good movie,"At times, the movie felt somewhat drawn out to me. Most of the details and scenes were necessary to the buildup, but I felt it could've been done in a more concise manner. The setting and feel of the first 3/4 of the movie also began to feel repetitive and, at times, boring.

With that said, the acting and plot in this movie were fantastic-especially the latter. The grand finale, which transpires over the last 20 minutes, deserves a 10/10 rating. Truly chilling the way it all comes together at the end. If it were all accomplished with a bit more brevity I think the desired effect would have been even more powerful.

20 March 2009,Another Example of American VIolence Porn,"This movie is almost unwatchable because of the pornographic use of violence. There are filmmakers who use violence sparingly when necessary and then there are the ones who wallow in it like porn. This is an example of the gratuitous use of violence. The studios know that Americans and lots of foreign markets like southeast Asia LOVE violence for its own sake and so they dish it up because it sells. It sells better than sex. Religious zealots will let their kids watch violence while insisting that they avoid sex. So these kinds of movies get elevated to Academy stature. It's symptomatic of the American psyche. We would rather let our kids kill someone than have too much sex. Okay, that's overstated but you get the point. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most famous violence porn producers. David Finscher is talented but I can just imagine him and Quentin masturbating to graphic violence. They need it to get off.

21 June 2023,Vile and exceedingly wicked,"This film truly haunts with its darkness. The crime at the end of the movie is shocking and full of chaos. I couldn't have guessed that the villain would do something so wicked. The ending is truly haunting, but that's what makes it intriguing. This film is the true definition of a thriller. Se7en doesn't play around with excessive philosophy, but instead presents extreme and terrifying nihilism. Director David Fincher successfully creates a terrifying atmosphere that surpasses the supernatural. It's a horrifying nightmare of terror, and its mystery holds the audience until the end. Despite being incredibly frightening, this film shows no mercy for a cruel world. I don't support nihilism in this film, but I see it as an extraordinary work. Without Fincher's chilling touch, this film wouldn't succeed. The screenplay writer is also remarkable, as they manage to present morally unsettling questions from beginning to end. It is relevant to the horrifying real world.

11 August 2003,Dark thriller,"Seven is by now more or less a modern classic. The movie is so dark that I almost felt depressed when I left the cinema. I disagree with another reviewer who calls it ""One of the most overrated ""thrillers"" of all time"". The only point this reviewer has is that the camerawork is great. Good acting, good story, great camerawork. Bottom line; If you are looking for suspense you will get it here. You might even get a depression, but that's for free.

One of David Fincher's (director) best films. Fincher is very talented but probably also very depressed considering the movies he has made. Except for Panic room (there is a turkey for you) he has made a couple of very interesting and unusual movies (Fight club, The game).

Thriller rating: 8/10 Movie rating 7/10

4 July 2016,"You Will Be Thinking About This For Days (Really, you do)","The 7 Deadly Sins: Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Envy. Wrath. Pride. Lust.

""Se7en"" is definitely a movie no one will forget after watching it. The story follows two detectives: Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) tracking down a serial killer who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins. Seriously, this movie kept me at the edge of my seat the first time watching it. I was too young to see the movie when it came out in 1995, but I managed to watch this on DVD just recently. This movie is told from the point of view from the detectives, trying to find the motives and reasons why the killer is taking out random victims. We see them in a frustrated situation (Brad Pitt's character is a fine example of this along with his F bomb dialogue).

The performances from the cast are superb. The majority of the film focuses on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's chemistry - how their relationship builds up as the two are desperately trying to solve the case. Gwyneth Paltrow is placed third in the top billing as Detective Mill's wife - a woman who loves her husband but has a dislike for living in the terrible city they live in. Her performance sells, but I feel she did not have enough screen time.

There is one other actor's performance I really want to talk about. But I can't. You'll have to see the movie for yourself and you'll know who I am referring to.

The movie never fails to lose your interest. You are invested in these characters solving a murder mystery that is (to them) not common, yet very disturbing. Each kill has been done off screen, and we are left to our imagination of how each murder went down. What we don't see is much more effective than if we do see...And I believe director David Fincher has done a great job at this. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout, and it's executed unexpectedly which works for this kind of film.

""Se7en"" was a movie ahead of its time. I can't imagine what would it be like had the film been made in let's say 1989-90. Definitely recommend this thriller if you're into surprises. Even on repeated viewings it's still a thrill to watch and look out for things you may have missed in the first time viewing.",10

2 January 2013,Divine Murder!,"Throughout history the Bible and its wisdom have been used as an excuse for murder. The director in ""Seven"" cleverly makes use the seven sins as Kevin Spacey's Divine permission to commit the biggest biblical sin of them all; murder! While Spacey is sacrificing his victims in the name of religion and punishing them in graphical behavior for their weaknesses; Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt appear as the prophets defending and protecting all that is good by trying to catch him. The director David Fincher keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch each brutal murder appear across the screen and as you watch Freeman and Pitt getting closer to their killer. Freeman always appears the wiser while Pitt gets more and more engulfed with rage as the killer taunts his pursuers while punishing his victims. We the viewers, are filled with anger and wrath (one of the sins themselves), as we want the killer to be caught but we realize at the end that he wants more than that! At the end the shocking revelation takes over our minds and fills us with even greater anger as we want Spacey punished! We also want him dead for his last brutal act! We also want Pitt to kill him! The question to be asked, is the unborn child saved from been born in a world full of religious contradiction or should those who wrong us be punished without question?",7
16 May 2003,Unlucky number,"""Se7en"" was the serial killer movie of the week at the time of its release. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt--apparently representing Reason and Passion, respectively--are cops on the trail of a serial killer. Kevin Spacey plays the killer as a Hannibal Lecter wannabe with a vengeful-angry-God complex: he bumps his victims off in ways that reflect the Seven Deadly Sins. Not a new idea; Vincent Price made two similarly-constructed movies in the '70s: ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" in which the inspiration is the ten curses of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus; and ""Theater of Blood,"" in which Shakespeare's plays provide the motifs. (""Se7en"" makes a nod in the direction of its predecessors by mentioning the ""pound of flesh"" associated with one of the murders.)

The difference is that the Price movies were jet-black comedies, while ""Se7en"" is a straightforward suspense thriller, and a relentlessly grim, gray, dark, rain-soaked one at that. It's technically well-made and unusually literate, drawing themes from Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, and medieval theology. And there's a strong echo of Dostoevsky's ""Notes from the Underground"": when the killer's lair is located, it's found to contain 2000 handwritten notebook journals of 250 pages each. (Quibbles: if he writes that much, when does he find time to do anything else... such as plan and execute fiendishly clever crimes? Also, we're told that none of the journals or entries are dated. As one who has kept a daily journal for ten years, I find that unlikely, especially since the killer is ultimately revealed to be even more, shall we say, detail-oriented than I am.)

The movie's ending (which I won't reveal here) is distressingly downbeat--and surprisingly so, as well. It leaves a nasty aftertaste. It could be argued that anything less would've been a cop-out, but it still was about as entertaining as a sucker punch. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" left us with Lecter on the loose, but at least there was salvation (the girl was rescued), redemption (the lambs were silenced), and retribution (the killer was dispatched without the incidental destruction of anyone else). By contrast, ""Se7en,"" which offers none of the above, is easy to admire, but hard to enjoy.",7
19 August 2002,The Se7ven deadly sins...,"SE7VEN is a modern thriller masterpiece, in tradition of other modern classics like Silence of the Lambs. The acting is magnificent, and Kevin Spacey played the sick, twisted villian perfectly. I don't think anyone got academy awards for this but they should have. Brad Pitt's emotional scene at the end is shockingly good, and Morgan Freeman once again does a great job in his thriller genre.

So have yourself a good time watching Se7ven. It will thrill you, scare you, haunt you, and even make you a little sick at the thought of what happened in the film. The ending is - quote me on this- ""So shocking that you won't believe your eyes!"" 4/5 stars-

8 June 2013,David Fincher's first MASTERPIECE.,"Sin: 1-transgression of divine law;

2-any act Regarded to such a transgression, especially the willful or deliberate violation of some religious or moral principle;

3-to commit a sinful act. The Sins began the film and led to the end,but it was no sin making this film.

""Se7en"", as you can see, it is about the seven deadly sins: Gluttony; Greed; Sloth; Lust; Pride or Vanity; Envy; Wrath. It all starts when the veteran Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the rookie detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) are both faced with a line of murders, and every death there is a message written with one of the deadly sins. They begin to notice that the killer, who later discover is called John Doe (Kevin Spacey) uses all sins for a different kind of murder. Soon both detectives begin a long study and research behind the insane psychopath who will later lead them to an unexpected end.

With ""Se7en"" David Fincher showed the fantastic director that he can be. He went from hated (thanks to ""Alien 3"") to a true filmmaker giving a spectacular direction. Each scene is shot accurately making the film more tense and the investigation more thrilling. But it also gives credits to Andrew Kevin Walker (screenplay) with a superb writing delivering dialogs very well written and developed, and an insane study in each of the sins, but even with the gloomy environment, the movie manages to have humor that pretty much serves to calm the frantic pace.

The cast is just wonderful. Morgan Freeman superb as always; Brad Pitt once again great; but who stands out is Kevin Spacey, after his appearance everything in the film seems to have a relapse, the suspense increases, the atmosphere darkens, all thanks to its whimsical and cultured expression of ""serial killer"".

An electrifying thriller, well directed and written, loaded with stunning performances, leading to an unexpected ending. ""Se7en"" is the film that brought David Fincher to filmmaking life and to the world his fantastic films.",10

25 March 2023,Se7en: A Masterpiece of Suspenseful Storytelling and Terrifying Atmosphere,"David Fincher's Se7en is a dark and twisted crime thriller that delivers a masterful and disturbing experience. The film follows two detectives, played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, as they hunt down a sadistic serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his inspiration for murder.

The film is anchored by its brilliant performances, particularly by Pitt and Freeman, who bring a raw intensity and depth to their characters. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, and their dynamic helps to elevate the film's tension and emotion.

What truly sets Se7en apart, however, is its masterful storytelling. The film's plot twists and turns in unexpected and shocking ways, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats throughout. The pacing is tight and deliberate, allowing the tension to build slowly until it reaches a climax that is both horrifying and satisfying.

Fincher's direction is top-notch, and his attention to detail is evident in every frame of the film. The dark and moody atmosphere he creates is both haunting and mesmerizing, drawing the viewer into the twisted world of the killer.

Overall, Se7en is a stunning achievement in filmmaking that is not easily forgotten. Its gripping story, powerful performances, and masterful direction combine to create an unforgettable and haunting cinematic experience.",10
22 September 2013,The best film of its genre by a mile!,"IMO this is David Finchers best film. Fight Club was good. The Game was interesting, but this overshadows them all.

Brad Pitt actually acts in this film, Morgan Freeman is awesome as always, but Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen.

This film had me gripped from start to finish, however it is the last 30 minutes of the film that made this so special. Never before or since I watched this film have I ever been so engrossed in a film than I was in the last 30 minutes of Se7en.

10/10. Superb.",10
23 June 2013,A Different Story,"It is seldom that a movie with such an eerie mood can continue with a continuously building story line and characters who are so dynamic. Modernism and beliefs lie at the heart of the movie, and Se7en does an exceptional job in executing a great plot with even better acting.

Most actors would not be capable of filling the roles of two detectives in such a morbid case. The stars Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt act wonderfully in their respective roles, and manage to remain in character and evolve throughout the film. Being initially introduced to the two men, both at different stages of life, viewers begin this exhausting journey which neither characters are prepared for.

With superb performances, underlying themes and a carefully manipulated script, Se7en truly does succeed in encompassing the qualities every great movie should. The numerous connections to religious and social affiliations offer a different view of the world, and share the side of things most do not see. Although the acts displayed are corrupt, which is a purely subjective topic, insights into the mind of a killer offer this movie a trait most lack - perspective.

The brilliantly written script, including fabrications many people would never even contemplate, puts Se7en on a new pedestal. This thought-provoking thriller is one for the ages, and is one that I highly recommend.",10
6 June 2022,One of the best but not for the faint hearted,"SEVEN is one of the best films I've seen in a long time..a cast you can only wish for, great story and David Fincher as director just sums it all up....brilliant film👍

11 June 1999,SPOILERS Another droll serial killer tale,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",1
24 January 2022,Really impressive.,"77/100

Se7en might just be the least David Fincher film out of all of the films I've seen from him up until this point. Nevertheless, that intent at keeping the audience at the edge of their seats in the very final act is still there. Besides from his hability to expand the screenplay's own storytelling with his impeccable usage of spaces and locations we've all seen to have improved over the years.

Even when I can't fully settle for the writing structure this movie aims at, which usually tends to mess around with conveniences, any lack of quality can't be prevailed. Anyone who calls this film ""badly written"" is just stupid.

Pitt does a great performance all the way to the very end, but who I want to call out is Freeman. He definetly became my favorite performance out of the whole film on account of the elaborateness he seeks in order to take over the scene he's acting in, even guiding some of the actors he's collaborating with as they go on.

Even when Se7en doesn't have the charm I've grown to love from David Fincher, this still very much is a film of his, and he managed to let us know the potential he eventually took advantage of was still there, even if it was just his second film.",7

19 July 2018,A dark psyco-thriller at its best,"A veteran detective counting his days to retirement and a rookie officer hungry for success and glory team up to hunt down a serial killer who refers to seven deadly sins in his gruesome murders. There's not a specific setting for the city where the drama unfolds except that it's a metropol area. The movie is perfect in directing, editing, acting and cinematography. Dark indoor scenes and narrow gloomy alleys shot under overcast and rainy skies fit very well with the brooding theme of the movie. Despite some intensive chase scenes and violence, Seven is not an action packed movie. Although it's technically classified as a crime thriller the psychological aspects of the main characters are emphasized. Some reviewers describe it as a slow paced movie but it is not. The scenes involving character development are as captivating as those with gun fights and rooftop chases. The tempo is successfully balanced in subplots but the tension is never lost and the movie never gets boring. While horrid murder scenes aren't for fainthearted they can't be compared to cartoonish blood and gore extravaganza in Tarantino's movie caricatures. Like all other scenes, the director D. Fincher uses them in moderation to instill terror in the audience. Some reviewers' comparison of the serial killer John Doe to Hannibal Lecture is ridiculous. With his unrealistic superhuman physical strength, H. Lecture's silly cartoon character looks more funny than frightening in scenes where he bites off ears and noses in a straight jacket and finds his way out from a locked iron cage. John Doe, on the other hand, is an average person who can be easily taken down in a fistfight but his psychopathic ramblings give him a much more real and menacing look.",10

8 April 2020,"Great, but very flawed.","The film is truly masterful in its presentation. Colour filter, aspect ratio, camera movements - the whole cinematography is superb. The production design is very impressive as well. For most of the film, the conversations have this awesome subtle delivery of the main background theme, it is present throughout the whole film and then in the 3rd act in the bar scene the characters literally discuss the so subtle delivered theme and explain its meaning... Did the makers of the film think we were too stupid to get it? Why make such a huge effort in delivering tons of subtle well-written conversations only to directly explain it all later on, it feels very unrewarding to be an insightful viewer watching this. Also, the ""master plan"" of the villain doesn't make sense, his final step is contradicting his own beliefs, it doesn't work at all.

2 January 2015,old genre with the new touch,"Crime thrillers had always been the curious genre since very long time, it's mainly because of those curiosity, suspense its succeeds in forming on-screen, and even to bring out special content in such hugely used genre is truly a challenge, very strong hold of the story, with some sadist killer's weird way of homicide and along with some best mode of investigations, all this stuff makes 1995's ''sev7en'' the best.

This movie is about two investigators in their way to unveil the killer behind the unusual murder mystery, the maker of this movie made this plot interesting with usage of some very unique kind of murdering (on the base of seven sins), I remembered Tamil film-maker Shankar's 2005 flick ''Anniyan'' where he had adopted somewhat same concept to make his movie interesting one, Shankar bought the concept of Garudapurana in his film and succeeded in catching the attention of mass, its sure that the unique things always wins the game.

Morgan Freeman is tremendous with his vast performing skills, his role as the Detective Somerset succeeds in creating an impact on viewers, Brad Pitt is another talented guy who makes this movie the complete one, his part as Detective Mills is awesome, and his top notch performance is seen at the climax that truly shows his qualitative on-screen depiction, screenplay is the heart of the movie and the camera work is mind blowing, and yes se7en is best with its wholesome presentation.",8
7 January 2022,A perfect thriller,"This movie has everything you could want in a good thriller, including compelling characters played by fantastic actors, a riveting storyline, plenty of twists and turns in the story and a shocking conclusion. The movie also explores themes and ideas to back up its compelling narrative. Overall, Se7en is one of the greatest thrillers ever made.

26 October 1998,"My favorite ""horror/suspense/thriller"" film","I was taken by the way this film used the viewer's imagination to conjure up the most horrifying images of this story without graphically displaying them on screen. I was gripped by the suspense surrounding horrifying questions of what? and more fightening still why? Mostly I was shocked and surprised and appalled as I learned the answers and found myself agreeing with the twisted logic of the grotesque madman behind the acts. A very worthy statement made loud and clear on film without the violent acts in actual life. Kevin Spacey is superb as always. He scared the heck out of me.

30 December 2022,Enjoyable thriller! A solid written mystery with an oscar caliber cast and the undeniable David Fincher at the helm.,"This enjoyable movie owes alot to its success to the acting. Brad Pitt as the brash, cocky, young and fearless Detective Mills who really got noticed in Hollywood after Se7en; and the amazing Morgan Freeman as seasoned veteran emotionally worn down by his years in the service Detective Somerset. Alot of the film plays off the interaction between these two completely different detectives who are forced to partner together to solve the recent killings of a serial killer who commits his murders directly relating to the seven deadly sins. Pitt as the new but not fresh young detective determined to solve the case by any means necessary and Freeman ready for retirement after this ""one last job"" just ready to focus on leaving it all behind and possibly look to settle down (he reveals he has no wife or children). They don't get along at all and their worldly views and perspectives completely clash with each other but they put differences aside to get to the bottom of one of the strangest cases they were ever assigned to.

Although littered with cliches this is a fine big time thriller with awesome support work from Gwyneth Paltrow and the very talented R. Lee Ermey who I really enjoyed in Full Metal Jacket. Another big time actor was a surprise to find here and is essential and crucial to this story but everyone who seen this already knows to reveal it is definitely ruining it for others.

The story at times feel slow paced but it is because its cerebral and spends time to explain details necessary to the audience to keep guessing without giving away anything. Its somber, dark, and grisly and also sad but very intelligently done. Its a very popular movie for good reason and David Fincher is your guy for fantastic thrillers that keep you entertained right until the end. Gone Girl and Zodiac recommended as well if you enjoyed this one. A 90s gem. Also does a fantastic job showcasing the library as the primary tool for public resource and knowledge before the internet came along. Classic literature and books in general in the spotlight here too. Bravo!",8

8 September 2022,Excellent,"Se7en is one the most unique thriller/mystery movies of all time. We follow an unlikely buddy cop duo as they search for a serial killer on the loose murdering victims based on the 7 Deadly Sins. Fincher takes more a restrictive approach by respecting the audience and only showing us what we need to see/hear while still getting his point across. The atmosphere and screenwriting are what cause this film to be set apart from other films in this genre.

Plot: 10/10 Acting: 9/10 Cinematography: 6/7 Score: 4/5 Enjoyable: 1/1 = 90/100

Favorite Character = Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman)

Favorite Scene = Car Ride Discussion

Favorite Quote = ""Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part."" - William Somerset.",9
2 December 2021,Perfectly terrifying,"Not one for watching these movies due to the stomach turning it causes me, but then I started to realise that's what makes this movie so captivating. Not all of the terrifying scenes were visual, a couple depended on your own imagination, scary to think about but it really pulled me into the film, I felt more and more horrified as the movie continued. You can expect quality art from these actors and the direction from the writing/ producer is top notch. Horrifying with a satisfying ending. Great film.

4 July 2012,Great direction for a great story,"Seven is a superb suspense thriller. The movie is binding with stellar performances by all the actors. Brad Pitt in his portrayal of a detective who is impatient with his partner is perfect , so is Morgan Freeman calm and calculated and , Kevin Spacey the serial killer who thinks his killings are justified .Gwyneth Paltrow also is brilliant playing a wife full of hopes.

The seven deadly sins are not a monarchy to anyone , each one of us in a way is affected and how deeply rooted they may be even in good people keeps us thinking long after the movie is over. The story telling is great and so is the direction , a must watch.

28 December 2015,One of the best thrillers,"One of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It's too bad that most of this genre movies aren't produced anymore during the last years. Best thrillers, in my opinion, are the ones from the '90s and early 2000. Why's that? Aren't there any good screenwriters? It's hard to find now days a good thriller that can blow you up. Most of them are at a 6 average mark or below and quite short (not so many over 1h30 min). Se7en has, almost everything that a thriller needs: action, emotion, curiosity, a good screenplay, good actors, unpredictable end and it is not a short movie. We have here a young Brad Pitt, that plays very well, a mid age Morgan Freeman as his mentor and a ""sick"" Kevin Spacey (in a good way, of course).

24 July 2012,"Sick, Twisted, and Depraved; Don't Watch This While Eating","In the first few minutes of this movie, you get a good idea of what it's going to be like. We are taken to a crime scene where a grotesquely obese ""shut-in"" has been murdered. His bloated, decaying corpse has been there for awhile, with roaches and other vermin crawling all over the place. If this grosses you out, don't expect things to get much better, for this flick is nothing if not a first class gross-out. While there are a few elements of some interest, such as the sequence where annoying and mouthy Detective Mills (Pitt) attempts to run down the serial killer, or veteran actor Morgan Freeman's downbeat interpretation of the jaded detective, the movie is otherwise sadly lacking in redeeming value. The concluding scene is just plain sick, the sort of thing we've come to expect from Kevin Spacey, whom I cannot stand.

13 June 2004,"Wanted to, but...","I really wanted to like this movie. I saw it long after everyone else did, and, though I knew it was gross and have a somewhat weak stomach, I also love stylish thrillers. I was disappointed (I know it was all for effect, but aside from everything else this movie gives a whole new dimension to the concept of rain and was distracting more than anything for me). It was like I was watching two different movies unfold-brilliance from Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, as you would expect, and yawning mediocrity from Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow, as you would also expect (the notion that she somehow captured the same statute for her asleep-at-the-wheel performance in ""Shakespeare in Love"" as Meryl Streep did for ""Sophie's Choice"" still torments me at night!) The ending was original and probably the reason most people seem to think it was a better flick than it was. Too much gore, too much rain, and too much Pitt-need I say more?

30 April 2008,Words cannot describe the unmitigated nastiness,"I know there are many reasons to like or dislike any movie, and that most people who rate a movie 1 or 0 simply don't 'get it'. I feel a great sympathy for those who cannot find anything to praise in a film. Se7en is not an especially bad movie; it creates and maintains a particular atmosphere most of the way through; it is deliberately grungy, nasty, and brutal. The extreme lack of lighting serves a purpose - Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now seems bathed in floodlights by comparison - and the film achieves its ends efficiently enough.

I am relatively OK with gore and violence (either on-screen or implied.) Many plots have holes, many movies get very clunky at the end, many actors share features with cardboard, and Se7en is no exception. If this film were in any way critical of the human capacity for the sheer unbridled brutality which it portrays, I might forgive it. If it had any redeeming qualities whatever, I like to think I would be prepared to try to acknowledge them, however grudgingly. Many dark movies manage to evince a knowing smile at some point, or succeed through technical brilliance or gripping acting.

But I came out of this film wanting to throw myself under the nearest bus. It was as if everyone involved with the making of this film had spat (I think I spelled that correctly) in my seat. My experience of this film exactly matched that of another reviewer: it raped my soul. What worries me most is that there are quite so many positive reviews for this movie. I think this would have been one of H.P. Lovecraft's favourites, since the guiding hand behind it is most obviously that of Cthulu.",1
21 January 2002,genre film with some style,"I thought this movie was a pretty remarkable exercise in style and an incredibly controlled performance by Morgan Freeman. Most of it is kinda cliched  the retiring cop breaks-in a rookie (by-the-book vs. the loose cannon working on a hunch), the clever serial killer, the soulless city, the standard noir ending where the searcher realizes that he is what he's been searching for and so on. The art direction is wonderful, with a real attention to detail. The movie makes for riveting viewing the first time around. I find myself skipping chapters though when I try to watch it again.

To make the last act measure up to the first hour of the movie, I think the writing should have emphasized the idea that the wrath/envy set up was an example of John Doe improvising after the detectives found his apartment. The wrath/envy scene doesn't have nearly the convoluted menace of the Sloth or Gluttony scenes. It's a noir thriller and Gwen is unaccounted for - the end seemed pretty obvious to me compared to the craziness of ""HELP ME"" in fingerprints.",7

The team was great. I'm not an fan of Brad Pitt but always I like his performance in Fincher's films. Then there's Morgan Freeman who is playing Morgan Freeman. And Kevin Spacey was OK.

Almost perfect among the films categorized in the group of thriller, it can be compared to the ""silence of the Lambs"" because of its dark, noir and almost gore plot. The film made me tense from beginning to the end.

""Se7en"" is one of David Fincher's best films. This is why is 9 out of 10 for me.

11 June 2002,Nauseating trash,"If the viewer enjoys reading bizarre, sensationalistic stories in The National Enquirer and watching surgical procedures on cable TV, this film might be of interest. It is not recommended for after dinner viewing unless one happens to suffer from bulimia. The fact that it has received such high viewer ratings speaks volumes about the state of society in the present day. The only redeeming feature is the performance delivered by Morgan Freeman as the veteran detective. Otherwise, it is a stomach churning gore fest in the deviant style so pervasive today. The events portrayed herein seem intended only to appeal to the very worst aspects of indecent human behavior. With films such as this setting the example, it is no surprise that our social structure is deteriorating so rapidly.

29 June 2013,This is a great film.,"Se7en has a lot of things going for it: A talented director and two among the best American actors of the past 20 years (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, the second at the start of his career). Furthermore, the plot is interesting enough: two detectives (Somerset and Mills) the first just before retirement with his much younger colleague try to resolve a number of murders perpetrated by a serial killer somewhere in a north American city (looks like Philadelphia but could be Chicago, it does not matter).

I think the strength of the movie lies with the interaction of these two characters who are so different from each other and see their job from very different perspective. Both are very good professionals but Mills is more ambitious and sees the murders as a puzzle to be solved and does not spend much time trying to understand the killer's motivations and mindset. Whereas Somerset is more resigned and perhaps pessimistic about the efficiency of the police force to fight and contain the evil of the serial killer and the crime in a big metropolitan city like the one the action takes place.

Finally, I thought that the movie tried to impose a visual style, e.g. The way of showing detailed images of crimes and torture that made me feel uncomfortable at times. If the director's message is that crime is bad because it looks 'bad' visually then I have some reservations.",

23 August 2011,Annoying,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",1
28 September 2009,Paradise Lost,"Two detectives, retiring veteran Morgan Freeman (as William Somerset) and hotshot rookie Brad Pitt (as David Mills), team up to trail a serial killer chalking up victims as an homage to the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" - ""Gluttony"", ""Greed"", ""Sloth"", ""Lust"", ""Pride"", ""Envy"", and ""Wrath"". Don't read anything more about this film; I didn't, and still had it figured out during the final road trip. That it's fairly predictable, and presents two ""stock"" characters, doesn't mean ""Seven"" (""SE7EN"" if you use all caps) is a bad trip.

In fact, it's an excellent film, with a stylish look created by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji, from writer Andrew Kevin Walker's intriguing story. Strangely, only film editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an ""Academy Award"". And, there were no acting ""Oscars"". Hopefully, Mr. Freeman just missed getting nominated for ""Best Actor""; he certainly deserved to be, for his sharply focused take on the character type also happens to precisely reflect the mood of the piece.

******** Seven (9/22/95) David Fincher ~ Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Paltrow",8
2 May 2021,We need to talk about Kevin,"I saw Se7en soon after it was released, and in some ways set the path for 8MM four years later. Rain pervades this flim until the climatic end where Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his life. Incidentally, Australian actor Nicholas Hope (Bad Boy Bubby) came close to getting Kevin's role.

So much has been reviewed about Se7en, so what more can I say, except that Kevin Spacey should not be excised from this historic film.

9 December 2017,Brilliant,"Two police detectives - one, Somerset, about to retire and the other, Mills, just transferred into the precinct - investigate the murder of an obese man. On his wall was written the word ""Gluttony"". Then they are alerted to the murder of a lawyer. On his floor was written the word ""Greed"". Somerset suspects that the murders were the work of the same man, a man murdering people who have committed the seven deadly sins.

Brilliant. Starts off as an intriguing, clever detective drama, showing how police go about investigating crimes, developing the characters and meticulously developing the plot. Highly engaging and enthralling. From a point it becomes more than a crime drama, developing some deeper undertones and ending as a dark psychological drama.

Superb ending with a very unpredictable twist. Ties the whole story together perfectly.

Solid performances from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in the lead roles. The standout performance, however, goes to Kevin Spacey who is chillingly good in his role. Reminded me a lot of his performance in The Usual Suspects.

Great work by David Fincher, directing only his second feature film (the first was Aliens 3). This movie made his career and created his signature of clever psychological dramas with a twist. Four years, and two movies, later he would surpass even the brilliance of Se7en with one of the greatest movies of all time - Fight Club.",10

19 April 2023,"The Lord works in mysterious ways, and so does Fincher","""He thought he was a prophet, had a message to deliver, so he wrote a book, a book worthy to compete with great names such as Milton, but in today's society no one read books, so he compromised, he went and made the news!""

Do you know that Kevin Spacey actually had the producers remove his name from the opening credits? And in the early advertisement of the movie his name is never mentioned, in order to have the audience geniony shocked at the time of his grand reveal. And that fact tells a lot about this movie and the level of commitment the cast had.

Such an amazing piece of art in terms of cinematography as well, you get to see some of the very best shots made in movies, from gloomy rainy metropolitan view to harsh barren outskirts of the city, it's the ultimate dance of the color pallets, seducing you into giving in to the atmosphere.

Overall a very good film especially for those with a little bit crush on the detective genre or Brat Pitt himself =))",9
7 August 2023,One of the best movies of all time!,"Like I said in the subject. They don't make movies like this, not anymore.

Morgan Freeman is an exceptional actor, so is Kevin Spacey. Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt.

Personally I am not a fan of Kevin's face because he has such a mean face ha ha, which obviously makes him a great negative actor.

The plot is beyond marvellous. There are so much good quotes in the movie said by Morgan and Kevin.

We live in a bad bad world.

Brad's part sometimes annoyed me, but it had its point in the end for sure.

I watched this movie for the 3d time and I can watch it always.

Gwyneth's part was OK but when after the 3d watch I understand some things even better and someone can say that some parts are predictable, maybe yes maybe not.

Anyway extraordinary movie and actors.",9
5 May 2021,One of the best movies ever!!!,"Se7en is unsettling , scary , gory , and unusual if you watch the movie you will know what i mean by saying unusual. It doesn't follow the thriller movie standards and does things in its own way and that's one of the reasons this is such a great movie. The characters are amazing and the villain is exceptional and the directing is phenomenal. Se7en is one of the best of movies of all time and its genre if not the best thriller I have seen. I highly recommend this movie.

It's really a much better production than any other film that's been made in those years. Morgan Freeman once again plays an old retired citizen. Ever since I was born, he's always been old.

30 July 2021,Seventh Hell,"David Fincher's searing, cop v serial killer thriller ushered in a slew of movies with themed killers and their grisly doings, variations on which are still being produced today. The original is undoubtedly the best however, helped by the imaginative plotting, fine lead acting and most of all taut direction here, as the John Doe killer, the now-disgraced Kevin Spacey, works his way through the seven deadly sins, inveigling into his nefarious plans the two detectives on his trail, leading to a fittingly shocking and heart-pounding climax.

The two detectives are old-hand Morgan Freeman, in his last week of active duty and Brad Pitt as the brash new 'tec on the block. You can be forgiven for thinking that early on, director Fincher is padding out his story with clichéd buddy-stuff between them, especially when Pitt's wife Paltrow comes into the picture but his methodology becomes clear as he leads us inexorably to the intense conclusion.

Notable for the gruesome detail of the murders depicted, a great on-foot chase through the rain-soaked city streets between Pitt and Spacey and of course the ""what's in the box"" culmination in the middle of nowhere, filmed in a dark, rainy greyish colour scheme, up until the broad daylight ending that is, with a brooding soundtrack and camera-work which mixes up extreme close-ups, vivid hand-held shots, urban detail and pre-drone landscape shooting, it's close to a masterclass in creating suspense and excitement.",8
2 March 2022,"""What's in the box? What's in the box?""","One of the best damn crime thrillers I've ever seen in my life. Dark, gory, and disturbing makes it one of those films that stick with you long after the credits roll.

Brad Pitt, and Morgan Freeman are both great in this film. Great cinematography, and holds up phenomenally well on my 4k tv would love to see a 4k Blu-ray release of this film. John Doe played brilliantly by Kevin Spacey makes him a very frightening, and disturbed serial killer. He's very intelligent, and methodical making John Doe the stuff of nightmares.

The only real issue I have with this film is pacing, it's only a 2 hour film so it can at times feel rushed, and I would've loved to have had more moments of our characters exploring, and examining the crime scenes.

If I could travel back in time to watch this film in a packed cinema with that ending I would do it, it must've been quite the experience. Coupled with an excellent score, and a great antagonist makes Se7en a film for the ages.

9/10

23 September 2015,"A short review of the classic ""Se7en""","Se7en is a true classic. Upon release people already knew that this movie was going to be a classic and would be seen for decades to come. With the two Oscar-winning actors Morgan freeman as detective Someset and Brad Pitt as detective Mills in the lead this movie provides a energetic and true acting. Se7en is about a reckless serial killer killing ""innocent"" people related to the seven deadly sins of Christianity. Detective Somerset and Mills are put to on the case, but they're soon to know that the serial killer has a plan for them both. This movie is without a doubt a cult classic film. Because of its unique camera angels and editing as well as its quite absurd ending. It does make you think about the lifestyle that we are living in. Therefore i give this movie a solid 9/10!

19 June 2020,Blech,"What an awful contrived bunch of crimes. There's nothing so irksome as overblown crime scenes with a message. Especially when you can see it would take the killer years to set up these ridiculous crimes. Kevin Spacey is nowhere fast. That last scene that is supposed to be so overwhelming was telegraphed so that by the time it was FINALLY revealed it was yesterday's news.

21 December 2001,A Gr8 film!,"Morbidly intriguing, disgustingly fascinating. I was deeply shaken by what I would call ""my favourite film"".

Forget Brad Pitt, I found Morgan Freeman's acting amazing. He is calm cool and collected throughout the whole film. A complete stoic.

Some good jazz tunes are part of the soundtrack and the film has style.

Watch carefully, the ""lust"" scene. I didn't understand what had specifically happened, the first time that I saw it.

I would like to compare the film with the psychological personality inventory called the Enneagram. ""Ennea"" is Armenian for 9ine and I guess gram means...chart? It is based on 9ine different personalities which, according to some sources corresponds to the se7en deadly sins + 2wo more.

1ne = wrath

2wo = pride

thr3e = deceit

4our = envy

fi5e = greed

6ix = fear

se7en = gluttony

ei8ht = lust

9ine = sloth

There is a theory about the enneagram (which I don't agree with) that states that a person will transform from 1ne personality to another in a particular order to become more psychologically healthy as a ""whole"" person. The order is this:

se7en: becomes fi5e

fi5e: becomes ei8ht

ei8ht: becomes 2wo

2wo: becomes 4our

4our: becomes 1ne who becomes se7en to complete the cycle

This is the same order that the ""sins"" are mentioned throughout the film. It's basically the same order as above.

se7en gluttony is mentioned first

fi5e greed is mentioned second

ei8ht lust is mentioned. 9ine sloth is mentioned, which is next door to ei8ht and breaks the cycle in half

2wo pride is mentioned

4our envy is mentioned

1ne wrath is mentioned.

In both cases The order is 7-5-8-2-4-1. I was obsessed by this fact in 1995 when the film came out because I was studying the enneagram at the time. Obviously, someone needed a life :)",
20 October 2021,They don't make movies like this anymore,"The entire experience from cinematography to plot development and attention to detail is 10/10. Usually, I'm quite critical when it comes to movies, but I can't find any flaws in this one. Imagine if modern day Hollywood and the modern day audience were less interested in ""safe"" blockbusters and superheroes and more interested in deep themes and character building... The acting is superb as well.

23 December 2011,Excellent,"So I seem to not have written a review for this film back when I saw it two years ago. What can I say? It's a great film. All of the classic elements of a crime thriller. Of course, that powerful ending... it still worked very well on a rewatch. Morgan Freeman steals this film though. He is the much more interesting character, and gives a quiet, understated performance. Paltrow does as well in her limited screen time, as does Kevin Spacey. This feels like a Fincher film... it's impeccably, almost perfectly made, with the usual colors and cold tones that Fincher films have. Overall, from the 5 Finchers I have seen (this, Fight club, Zodiac, Benjamin Button, and The Social Network) this still ranks at the bottom, though all he has is great films, and I have rewatched all of his films at least once.

21 September 2016,Man vs. Society,"Rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. From the opening credits leaving out Kevin Spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, Se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic naïve state through the eyes of Mills and Somerset. Although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. Presented beyond the surface, however, Se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of Dante's ""Seven Deadly Sins."" Se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. Even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like Mills in the ending. The only individual within Se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was Somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. Somerset and Doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. Doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but Somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. Therefore, Se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. On the surface, Mills and Somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, John Doe, who is the antagonist. Indirectly being argued, however, is that Doe and Somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including Mills). That is why I give Se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film.",10
8 July 2005,"Methodical, Calculated, Brilliant","This story takes you where it wants you to go.

The proof is that while there are some gruesome acts in this movie (you only see the aftermath, no action), the most disturbing crime in the movie is the least gruesome.

There are very few movies that pull-off a mix of repulsive crime and psychological involvement as well as this one.

The character development was done very well with while not distracting you by burying you in the personal life of each character

Initially, I felt the main detective character was a little unbelievable a bit too methodical. As the character developed though, you start to see that as a part of his personality, the element that levels the playing field between him and the criminal. In the end, I found him to be as diabolically analytical as the criminal.

The chess game between the main detective and the criminal was flawless. Had they got the criminal into custody any other way than they did.. it would have ruined the movie.",9
4 September 2000,A Little Bit Better than 7 on a Scale of 10,"Amazingly creepy and surprisingly realistic police drama about two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) who are trying to stop a crazed killer (Kevin Spacey) who is using the seven deadly sins as his inspiration. The suspense is kept at a fevered pitch throughout the film and the actors all perform to the paramount. Definitely a film for those who like film-noir styled movies, but not for those individuals who might have a weak heart. 4 stars out of 5.

14 March 2013,A disturbing masterpiece,"This movie effected me emotionally more than any other movie I can think of. (Except maybe for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, for different reasons.) Basically, it's about a young cop and an old cop who's about to retire, who investigate a serial killer whose murders are based off of the seven deadly sins.

What makes it so horrifying is that you see the aftermath. You hear the investigations, as they detail what happened. Match that with the images of the dead bodies, and you've got yourself a profoundly effective mental image. Good luck sleeping tonight! Aside from the disturbing elements, the movie is still a good movie. Pitt and Freeman give great performances as usual, and it helps that their characters are likable. Pitt's character is an arrogant ass. Or is he? As you find out by the way he acts outside the police station, he seems likes a fun guy to be around. And as the movie goes along, you see how his job and the disgusting murders that he has to get knee deep into affect him as a person. Freeman's character is pretty much the straight-up good guy, and you could argue that he's the typical ""retiring black cop"" that was made more common by Glover's character in the Lethal Weapon series.

The story is very engaging, as the investigations become more intense, and the more the protagonists get wrapped up in the case. So much so, that the climax (which begins with possibly the most heart-pounding chase scene I've ever seen) becomes one of the most jaw-dropping and engrossing pieces of film I've ever witnessed.

The dialogue is good, but with only a couple memorable lines (which I won't say, because they either possibly spoil the movie, or aren't that great unless you've actually seen the scene.) However, with that said, the dialogue is used as a tool for sending a graphic mental image to your head during the murder scenes. And that, is probably the best words can do in a movie.

Overall, if you can get over the shudder-inducing murder scenes that I've only brought up about a thousand times up to this point, definitely give this movie a go.",10
11 January 2004,One of the finest films ever made...,"I first saw this movie when I first visited America, I knew nothing about this film (as it had just opened) so I paid my money and gave the film a chance. It simply blew me away. The ending is just unbelievable. The performances are fantastic, the direction and art design are exceptional and Kevin Spacey (my fave actor) popping up towards the end was the icing on the cake. Plus every time I watch the film now it reminds me of being in America... it's my favourite movie, for so many reasons. :)

13 February 2006,Better than Fight Club...!,"Now don't get me wrong, I love Fight Club and will write a very positive review of that movie sometime soon. However, to me, Se7en will forever be the superior film.

The plot, if you haven't seen or heard it before, concerns two detectives. One is old and about to retire while the other is new and fresh to the city. Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is as grizzled a veteran as can be imagined, his lined, elderly face folding into itself with the worries of life and the job in the city of Los Angeles (I think), a place he regards as Hell on Earth and which he is very happy to be retiring away from. Of course, like every cop on his way out (in Hollywood at least) Somerset has one last case to face, although it isn't his to take. Instead it's the property of a young buck, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) who initially treats it as 'just another nasty corpse,' in this case a man literally eating himself to death. Of course, where director David Fincher is involved, a tag like that is bound to be less than the whole story and, before long, a second body is discovered.

Further plot explanations will only spoil the rest of the film, but stay put through the quiet, if edgy opening and you'll be hugely rewarded. This movie crackles with menace and, even before we meet the man responsible for all the carnage (Kevin Spacey's 'John Doe') you'll have experienced some truly horrifying, terror inducing moments. The fact that few if any of these are the product of screeching music or artificial suspense is a fine testament to Fincher's skill and the generally understated production of the film. Pitt isn't pretty, Somerset is hardly a benevolent mentor and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Mills' wife Tracy) is the epitome of be-trodden womanhood, someone whose former carefree existence in some quiet little town outside of LA has become a living nightmare inside of it.

The cast really shine in this film, as does the director and just about everyone involved. At no point during proceedings are you entirely sure that another horror isn't right around the corner, this despite the fact that the majority of the seven atrocities are seldom even shown on screen. Fincher whets our appetite with almost graphic descriptions by junior policemen at the scene and lets the camera play over the locations of the murders just skirting the defiled corpses... but seldomly are we given the full visual. This technique actually makes the whole thing much more disturbing as your imagination is left to fill in the gaps. A corpse on film is seldom unpleasant after you've seen it once or twice. One tantalisingly close yet just out of sight can haunt you far more! And when Fincher cheekily allows himself one moment of surprise it bursts from the screen with all the greater force because of his earlier restraint.

In this movie the acting, the atmosphere, the direction, the music, the plot and the pacing are all top notch and make this film a must have on DVD. Any criticisms I have are limited to a sense that there is a prevalence of style over substance in Se7en, something I think Fight Club also suffers from. The minimalist outlook and constant rain all make for a compelling atmosphere, but you only very occasionally get a feel for how big the case is. Instead it more often seems like an irrelevancy in the fast moving metropolis whereas, in fact, the murders are meant to ignite a media frenzy that ultimately leads to the films' incredible conclusion. But that is a minor quibble and one that you must probably accept with all Fincher's work.

All in all this is a fantastic movie and the perfect antidote to the usual, asinine output from Hollywood (and since I'm writing this the day before Valentine's day I feel particularly vindicated in saying that!). Every cast member does their job perfectly, even the more extreme outbursts of emotion being delivered in such a way as to appear genuine, rather than the 'oh it's just an actor looking for an Oscar' pitches that I often feel when I see a modern, 'worthy' film. On top of that you seldom feel like your watching a movie. The director keeps many of his usual tricks to himself this time, instead giving us more of an insight into, rather than presentation of, three extraordinary days in the lives of two ordinary cops (Somerset and Mills). This understatement and holding back makes for a much better film and, while Fight Club may be cooler, Se7en is superior.

Therefore my recommendation is: if you haven't seen Se7en then do so at the earliest opportunity, though be warned... you'll need a friend close by soon after!",10

25 January 2023,"Overrated, but still well-made","An impressive achievement about itself. I have sympathy for Seven naysayers in that the movie nihilism feels very arrested development and Walker script is a serviceble one blowup for too lofty ambitions (by him and Fincher), but there's no deny conviction and Fincher really put a lot of effort into his urban hell (Taxi Driver made by people who saw it at the right impressionable age) and Freeman sells the grim determinism for all its worth. It is an overlabored movie that very much needs all the heavy hand to make its effect convincing. It also has a lot of good old fashioned craft to sustain itself. It is predicted in the opposition between the cops investigative grunt work (which intentionally goes nowhere) and Spacey's grand design (which as smarter people than me have point out Fincher keeps equating with his own). The Hollywood machinery parts work very well starting with Freeman/Pitt stock pairing, a great collection of faces filling the background and Fincher and his main collaborators (Khondji, Francis-Bruce, Shore, the Max/Wissner/Griffith trio) do put together some impressive big scenes around the investigative work. I remember seeing Seven with my dad during the original release and the ending was the greatest thing ever, but now I think the movie mostly loses me after Spacey big theatrical entrance, part is his very mannered performance meeting Walker script going into overdrive, part is feeling the strings too much, anyone who reads me knows I don't care about plausible logic, but the extense that the movie effect depends on equating Spacey to God/Fincher means the flimsiness of the whole thing does feels wrong, far too reverse engineered to make the payoff really work. Still, there's some one hour of great stuff delivered by some very skilled people doing top tier work and it was very important for me once upon a time, but I can't deny it works better now as occasional 20 minutes chunks on cable.",6
22 July 2013,Se7en is a beautiful film and worth watching. I agree with both parts.,"Getting into the film noir genre was probably one of the best things I've done for myself as a person who loves film. Deep, moody stories all the while being stylish and evoking a despondent atmosphere are definitely my type of movies. Movies that ask important questions of us dealing with our humanity or depicting the ugliest parts of the human psyche that is disturbingly relevant to our modern society shows that movies are more than just mere entertainment. This is everything that makes Se7en a great movie, in my opinion.

I could go on and on about the film, but first I have got to talk about the atmosphere that makes the movie so effective in many ways. It is just pure grit and grime and I love the film's consistency in its tone. Not just through its sets, but also the color tones that were used to enhance every scene makes each scene moody and ominous. These aesthetics definitely make for a lot of great cinematography and there is quite a number of memorable shots in the film. A key scene for me would be all the scenes taking place in the library, which are definitely some of the most beautiful cinematography I have seen in film thus far.

What also makes Se7en stand on its two feet are definitely great performances from Morgan Freeman who makes each movie I've seen him in have depth and character. While Freeman delivered a performance to compliment the film's story, Kevin Spacey was definitely the one to steal the show. To deliver such a disturbing performance that elicits just as much fear as watching Hannibal Lecter on screen was a feat that I didn't even know could be accomplished. I was holding my breath in every scene he spoke to another character. He was that captivating in his acting performance.

I don't know what else to say without spoiling this great movie, other than that anyone who is a fan of the noir genre or just a person who enjoys a good story should definitely watch Se7en. The film is so good that I had to include this on my personal list of my top favorite movies of all time. A pure classic in every way.",10
14 January 2020,It may not be the Snow White Reboot I wanted but I wasn't disappointed.,"This movie lives up to the hype. With a great concept and a unique tone, the oppressive ethos of the inner city is our backdrop for two rich but contrastive characters on the hunt for a particularly creative species of evil, one that is itself on a crusade against human vice.

Detailed, clever and restrained, the sensation of growing dread never quite goes away.

8 April 2001,The McDonald's of Horror Films,"Wow. There are a lot of bad films out there, but even with the worst of the worst there is some redeeming quality, like that neato big wave in the Perfect Storm. But Se7en? The acting is flat (Brad Pitt's opening lines seem like they're coming from someone acting for the first time, his moaning at the end, when he gets his special gift, just seemed pathetic); the script is not at all inventive and unsuccessfully covered up by hyperbolic special effects and redundant gore. The ""twist"" at the end is hardly disturbing because the writer/ director have been shoving gimmicky horror effects down the our throats for the entire movie.

People who like this film- the dark, urban atmosphere, the pseudo-noir elements: please watch some David Lynch films and see how this should be created, i.e. not by using video game titles, not by relying heavily on special effects, make-up, and yet ANOTHER plot with biblical references, but instead by a careful selection of actors, beautiful cinematography, and incredibly original stories.

Stop funding this director so that he will go back to making TV commercials instead of two hour long theater commercials.",1
22 August 2020,Incredible.,"An absolutely fantastic film. Fantastic acting from Pitt and spacey. Although was slightly slower at the start you do get sucked into the story and the atmosphere, one of those times you realise 2+ hours has flew by, you get completely gripped to the thrilling story.

Won't say much about the story but it's excellently written and the payoff at the end of the film is great.

One of the best films I've seen in a long time, really need to check out more by David!

17 May 2007,"One of the scariest, nastiest thrillers ever filmed - makes The Silence of the Lambs look like a children's movie!","1991: Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs shocks the world, gets almost unanimous praise from critics and audiences alike, and wins five Oscars, proving serial killer flicks can be more than just a sub-category of the thriller/horror genre. 1995: David Fincher, still scarred by the mixed reactions to his first film, the underrated Alien 3, unleashes Se7en. The latter wins no Academy Awards, but people are so impressed/disgusted/terrified by the ferocity and bleakness of Fincher's vision it actually manages to make Demme's work seem rather tame. So uncompromising it is occasionally hard to watch, Se7en paints a disturbing portrait of madness no other film has been able to match.

Ironically, none of the gruesome murders in the film occur on screen: what we are shown is merely the aftermath, which is more than enough to upset the weak of stomach. It sure as hell upsets William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a police officer who is about to retire but has to solve this last, horrific case. Helping him with the investigation is the edgy David Mills (Brad Pitt), a young hothead who wants to put the killer behind bars and make sure he suffers as much as the victims (the killings are based on the seven capital sins). Unfortunately for them, this guy is not someone you catch that easily: John Doe (a name usually given to unidentified corpses) is a cold-blooded, calculating psychopath, and once he unveils his big project, nothing but pain can derive from it.

What distances Se7en from most Hollywood thrillers is the consistently dark, nerve-cracking mood: while the average shocker has some kind of redeeming trait in the end, Fincher decides to go all the way with his unflinching study of the human psyche, leaving no room for hope or salvation. As repulsive as they may look, Doe's murders are actually little more than the premise: the really bad stuff happens after-wards, and even the most skeptical viewers will probably gasp in horror as the film reaches its almost unbearably bleak conclusion (the kind of ending late-night pub discussions were created for).

The unsettling atmosphere is also due to the performances, Freeman's understated sadness being the ideal counterbalance to Pitt's brooding rage (a side the actor took to sublime levels in his other collaboration with Fincher, the splendid Fight Club). But it is Kevin Spacey (there's no use in not mentioning him, since by now everyone knows he is in the movie before they have even seen it) who truly leaves a mark, in the role that, alongside his Oscar-winning turn in The Usual Suspects, set the bar for every other villain to have been created since. He may not be on screen for much time, but then again, neither was Anthony Hopkins when he played Hannibal Lecter for the first time. The difference is, John Doe is so merciless and sadistic even Lecter would probably be afraid of running into him.

In the end, some people might not be able to watch this film; some might even refuse after reading a summary. But those able to stomach it will see not only a very cruel thriller, but also a compelling example of everything that's generally missing in Hollywood nowadays: film-making has seldom been so bold and fearless.",10
8 April 2016,Meaningful serial killer movie,"one of the best film about serial killer... Meaningful movie,Although the story isn't original, it's powerfully directed by David Fincher, The investigation and the clues that lead to the murderer are well thought out and continually provocative. As a narrative, the film is quite involving.The Morgan Freeman gives another of his superbly understated performances. Decent film making, universal subject, overall good performance, David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in American film history, far more interesting, handles the violence with sensitivity, announcing its obscenity in spoken analyses and briefly glimpsed post Morten shots, but never showing the murderous acts themselves.

16 November 2006,Could very well be the best serial-killer film ever made,"Some cinephiles give praise at the altar of Hitchock; others worship Kubrick or Scorsese. Personally, I'm a David Fincher fan, and see him picking up where they left off. Easily one of the most distinctive and talented young directors to come out of the 1990s, he still remains something of a 'cult' filmmaker, in spite of the $100-million box office take of ""Seven,"" possibly the best, most intelligent serial-killer thriller ever unleashed on unassuming film patrons.

What Fincher pulls off--and pulls off brilliantly--is a straight-faced, serious approach to a concept that could have easily devolved into camp or slasher-flick excess. On initial glance, the notion of a serial killer who picks his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins seems like the type of tongue-in-cheek fodder for a low-budget '70s or '80s exploitation item; even the tag line (""Seven Deadly Sins--Seven Ways to Die"") sets the tone for a straightforward, mainstream thriller.

What a surprise, then, that ""Seven"" is the type of smart, suspenseful, brilliantly-designed and -acted thriller that is nearly one-of-a-kind (""The Silence of the Lambs"" follows close behind). Even more surprising is how the film stormed into the public imagination after ""Alien3"" (1992), Fincher's sour--and quickly forgotten--directorial debut. I hadn't seen a former music-video director operate with such authority in the realm of mainstream cinema (and, come to think of it, I haven't seen one since). Nor have I seen a director take as many commercially-averse risks within such a short career--""Fight Club"" (1999), despite a short theatrical run and polarized reviews, has become to young-adults of today what ""Easy Rider"" was to the Flower Children in '69.

Granted, the amount of respect I've given ""Seven"" has fluctuated over the years, and it seems that only now do I see it as being a near-flawless masterpiece. At 15 years of age, it was just a cool-looking 'horror' film--I couldn't latch on to Morgan Freeman's dialog, and found Brad Pitt's cocky go-getter to be more easily relatable; at 25 years, the deeply-entrenched realism of the script, mixed with Fincher's grimy, urban-life-as-Hell visuals and the jaw-dropping performances (not just from the principals--when was the last time you saw notorious scenery chewer R. Lee Ermey in a small yet serious role?). While Brad Pitt's performance might inspire hoots of derision from some, he is actually pitch-perfect as the young, idealistic Detective Mills--this isn't Brad mugging the camera with his good looks for 2 hours; on the contrary, his counterpoint to Morgan Freeman's worldly, jaded, and cynical Somerset makes the movie. And once the killer is captured, these 3 characters share an entrancing conversation within the confines of an unmarked police car; sure, we get to hear the killer's explanation for his crimes, but it is in the tones and reactions to what is said that the sequence conveys a disturbingly chilling power. (It may seem moot at this juncture, but I will say nothing of the killer's identity, save that it was a choice casting decision that paid off wonderfully.) Even Gwyneth Paltrow, then a fresh-faced, relatively unknown starlet, delivers a small yet poignant performance as Mills' long-suffering wife; her scene in the diner with Morgan Freeman is painful, culminating in advice that seems especially dismal, considering what we've come to expect in the way of Hollywood Happy Endings.

Which brings me to one of the most surprising--and refreshing--aspects of ""Seven"": the way in which it relentlessly plays against audience expectation. Like the murderer's motive, this is not a film of happy endings but lessons learned (in the harshest way possible). To those who have seen the film--love it or hate it, that incredibly subtle yet wholly grisly final scene is unforgettable, and truly shows that, contrary to current horror trends, ""less is more"" (notice that all but one murder happens off-screen).

While I could gush at even further length about ""Seven,"" I think I've made my fanfare more than clear. It's an introspective, compelling film that manages to mine terror and pathos from those daily transgressions we all view as ""common."" And it established David Fincher as a director of great (and continued) promise. Kudos.",9

3 June 1999,This movie is horrible!,"What can I say. The movie was soooo dark, so depressing that I just wanted to turn it off and throw it in the trash. Thank goodness I only rented this. I continuously wanted for something good, something exciting and It was just words and a picture of a dead man with police wandering around. The movie was sooo bad that it made my other rental film Urban Legend look like an exciting horror classic---and that was only an OK film. Seven is a horrible experience, little gore, little action, mild absurdities, basically a very gloomy unentertaining tone. Even Gweneth Paltrow was stupid and frankly had--no interesting lines and they didn't even show the way she looked at the end--so upsetting. Just like the Baby with Rosemary's baby, the director denied a crucial element, it is just that unlike Rosemary's Baby, I didn't care an inch about the way Seven looked at that point. Thrillers like Fatal Attraction, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, and The Tie That Binds are movies that at least have an entertaining and lighter deranged glow. Seven is just dark, boring, and so uninvolving. The actors good but the story stunk.

19 July 2021,Extreme Deal Or No Deal!,"I probably haven't watched this film since it came out on VHS (Yep, that long ago). I thought that I'd better watch it again before I added it to my films list as I really couldn't remember all that much about it. And that is probably because apart from the very end it's quite a forgettable film.

Although, I believe, the focus is supposed to be on Brad Pitt's character, it is definitely Morgan Freeman that owns this film. He gives a great performance as the embittered older detective, as he always does, but he just doesn't have the support of a good story or script.

For me, it would have been better if Brad had been part of 21 Jump Street instead as his character is very similar to that. He's not mature enough to be a big bad detective. Which I realise is supposed to a part of the story, but that's not how it comes across.

As for Gwyneth? This is possibly the worst performance I have even seen from her! Her character is just weird and apart from the end, quite superfluous to the story.

As for Kevin, is this what he got up to before he was in 'The Usual Suspects'(1995)? He plays freaky, odd people too well. Maybe that's why his private life allegedly went wrong?

You do have to wonder about the weirdos that write these things? I mean I have some very sick thoughts, but these murders are just bizarre. I think they tried too hard and didn't deliver.

It doesn't seem to flow very well and it's a bit drawn out. The whole thing seems a bit disconnected.

18 December 2006,A Very Good Thriller!,"This very good film is about Detective David Mills, a new detective, and and his partner, Detective Lt. William Somerset, who is about to retire, working on a case of a serial killer using the seven deadly sins for his motive.

The first person to die is a person with the sin, gluttony. The aftermath of the ""kill"" is very disturbing. That's basically the word that would describe all the other kills in this film. This film is a very good thriller. In fact, it's one of the best films ever.

Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman gives great performances, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, played by the killer, although he shows up almost through the last half of the film.

Just like Saw, the killer wants to punish those who are bad. For once, we have a killer we agree to, or at least I do. Like many thrillers, this film has this great ending. This is a smart thriller. There's not a lot of action. It's just your usual detective story.

If you like a very smart thriller that will make you think, without making you look stupid, with great performances, this movie will do.",7

12 September 2007,"a dark and terrifying thriller that if you can withstand its horrific style and gritty suspense, will be realized as one of the finest films of the 90s","Of course, thrillers and horrors, which ""Se7en"" is top of the line, are not everybody's cup of tea. And many people probably would find a film such as this just simply too gory, too violent, and too graphically realistic to find appealing or even compelling. ""Se7en"" was not intended to be a movie for the soft-stomached, and maybe even made to twist knots in the strong-stomached. Whatever the case, it is exactly what it was intended to be: a horrifying and hair-raising thriller. But what it also possesses is excellent craftsmanship and creativity. All of the traits needed for a great film are present in ""Se7en"". I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I couldn't get some of the scenes out of my head. Not just because they were so brilliantly shot, but also for being so disturbing. But this did not make me dislike the film any. Sure, I got chills up my spine, but I saw it as an excellent example of film-making.

""Se7en"" utilizes the basic concept of most cop movies. Two detectives, quite different from one another, try to track down a serial killer and bring him to justice. But ""Se7en"" takes this basic plot idea and expands it a little further to give all of the characters a purpose. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman were both magnificently flawless in their performances and gave us the impression that we were looking at real cops, not just two popular actors performing on screen. That's what I really look for in a movie with big stars on the cast list. I see if the characters are used to create good performances and characters, not just to lure people into the theater. And the serial killer, whose identity and performer I will keep anonymous for those who have never seen ""Se7en"" turned out to be one of the most brutal and above all, cunning serial killers and what's more, his actions had a purpose in the film. Instead of just simply murdering people for the fun of it or even having a personal problem with them, he bases his attacks on victims who he feels have committed a crime that society does not feel is worthy of a penalty. The effect of limiting his screen time helped to increase the effect of his initial appearance, very much like the shark from ""Jaws"".

The set designs in the film are amazing. We are never told on screen where exactly this city is located. Maybe it's Los Angeles or New York City, but whatever the case, the city is displayed as one of the most grimy and dirty cities you'd expect. We seldomly, if ever, see a clear blue sky while under the tall skyscrapers. There's smoke in the air, it's raining almost all of the time to give enhance the appearance of such a dirty environment. And then we think about the characters, one of whom has lived almost all, if not all of his life in such a place and wonder how he stayed so long.

""Se7en"" is a magnficent example of 90s film-making. Perhaps it is a bit flawed in a few aspects, such as too much dialogue sequences that seem to drag on for a while longer than they should. But it works out as a thriller and horror film on an epic scale. Some people will find it too disturbing for them, but for me, it's a very well-done film with an unexpected and brilliant climax.

""Ernest Hemingway once wrote ""the world is a fine place and worth fighting for"" I agree with the second part."" -Morgan Freeman as Detective William Somerset",8
7 August 2007,"The Essential ""Tracking the Killer"" Movie...","A detective (Brad Pitt) moves to the big city (possibly New York, but never stated) just as another (Morgan Freeman) is retiring. For the last seven days of the retiring detective's career, they must track down a serial killer who bases his killings around the seven deadly sins. Gwenyth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, John C. McGinley, and Richard Roundtree also appear.

This film starts out with an amazing Nine Inch Nails remix of ""Closer"" over some spooky credits that will play a part in the film later on (but you probably will not make the connection until your second viewing). This sets the tone for a mid-1990s film of nihilistic, dark despair. Unlike another mid-1990s film (""Empire Records"") that focused on the pop aspects, this film is for all those who saw the dark side of the decade.

That nihilism is evident, and really summed up the 1990s for some (and ushered in the peak of Tim Burton's career, along with industrial music and films like ""The Doom Generation"". John Doe speaks of the general ""apathy"" of the world, which came to the forefront in the 1990s, I think, with Marilyn Manson and ultimately ending with Columbine when we were shocked back to our senses. If the 1990s were a color, it would have been black.

Visually, the film is stunning, even in the death shots. The gluttony victim, which starts the movie out, is a corpse you will never forget. The acting here is quite good, perhaps among Brad Pitt's best work. There is an odd moment or two, but overall he is flawless. This is likely the film that solidified his career for the next decade (more than ""Thelma and Louise"" ever did). Morgan Freeman is great, but when is he not? His mere presence exudes genius.

As far as serial killer dramas go, this one is as well written as possible. Another one, ""8MM"", from the same writer, is also pretty good. But I think this one takes the cake. Other cop dramas with Morgan Freeman (""Along Came a Spider"", for example) are also well written. But again, this takes it. The blend of action, humor, dark grisly death and literary intelligence is just superb in its smooth mixture. What other serial killer is using Dante and ""Paradise Lost"" as a guidebook?

Can I again say the supporting cast is good? Paltrow almost never fails to impress, and this is one of her more vulnerable roles -- a dainty flower in a hurricane. Ermey is his typical authoritarian self, but more reserved here, to his credit. And Roundtree is at the peak of his career, as well -- this may not be ""Shaft"", but I think he comes across as a serious actor here in a way he never has before.

As anyone will tell you, this film is ranked in the top fifty for a good reason: it is a stellar film. If you do not mind a little blood and plenty of curse words, you will love the intricate and well-woven plot here. I recently watched the film again -- possibly my fifth time now -- and it only grows better with repeat viewings. In short: Delightfully sinister!",9

31 October 2021,You won't find anything like this one,"The number of emotions I went through when watching this film was insane. At one point I'm feeling intense, the next I'm relaxed, then shocked, I can probably name you seven different emotions but you would have probably stopped reading by now. This psychological crime thriller is one of the greatest of all time: brilliantly planned without any notable flaws in the plot, a work of art production design, and not to forget about the title sequence. The acting was class, especially since my strong point is reviewing character development, this sure hit top marks with David Mills (Brad Pitt). The story as a whole was terrific, leaving me jaw-dropped by the end. A must-watch film that I'm sure you will enjoy.

21 June 2023,"Take me away from this Hellhole City, where the rain pours down and the murders are gritty.","""Seven"" is one of the most successful and widely acclaimed thrillers in cinema history, and it's fairly straightforward to see why. It has a familiar and always-effective plot (rookie cop and nearly retired veteran on the trail of a vicious serial killer), the cast is stupendous (Pitt, Freeman, Paltrow, ...), the director (David Fincher) is multi-talented, and there is tension and a shocking twist-ending. It's a guaranteed winner.

And yet, ever since I watched it for the first time at the age of 16, I have personally always been somewhat 'underwhelmed' by this great classic of the horror and thriller genre. Many things that make it unique are not necessarily elements I appreciate. Like the fact that none of the serial killer's murders are actually shown, for instance, or the assumption that a deranged genius spends an entire year meticulously executing a murder, like sloth, and even pay for the victim's apartment rent every month. The character of Det. Somerset (Freeman) I also found quite implausible. A super-intelligent homicide veteran who reads Dante and knows the Bible by heart? Not likely. After a careful build up and deep-dive into the first two murders, gluttony and greed, the next couple of murders (covering sloth, pride, and lust) come across as rushed. And even though I respect the shock-impact of the finale, I honestly feel it doesn't match with all the intelligently convoluted and carefully prepared murders the killer committed previously.

There is one massive contributor that I find amazing, though, and that's the nameless city in which ""Seven"" takes place. I double-dare anyone to come up with a cinematic city that looks more disgusting, depressing, unpersonal, and dreary than the setting of this film. The city in ""Seven"" even makes notorious fictional hellholes like (Ba-)Sin City and Gotham look like Disneyland. It rains constantly and heavily, the buildings are ramshackle, rushing trains shake up houses, people can go missing for more than a year without this being noticed, and it's full of lethally dangerous John Does.",6
4 October 1998,"Great serial killer movie, worthy company for ""Silence of the Lambs""","Just when I thought I was de-sensitized to horror films, ""Se7en"" comes along. I felt completely unsettled after seeing it for the first time. When Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were checking out the ""Sloth"" victim securely tied to the bed, I saw one of the nastiest surprises ever! For a couple of days, I didn't want to talk or even think about that particular scene. Religious people were scary enough, but Kevin Spacey--playing as the religious fanatic serial killer--just made them a little scarier,as if that were ever possible! Overall, this is a great serial killer movie and ranks right up there with ""Silence of the Lambs.""

17 April 2005,Slightly overrated...,"I think ""Seven"" is an excellent crime drama with great acting, script, cinematography and score. Somehow though, it hasn't held up (for me) over time and repeated viewings as well as it should. I just viewed it again today, and although enjoying it I no longer get the 'kick' I once did. Once the ending is known, it definitely loses some of its power. See the ending more than a few times, and that loss starts to extend over the last 20 minutes of the film as well (starting from the time the killer turns himself in).

Something about the style of the film hasn't held up that wonderfully either, or maybe it's just been over-used at this point and feels tired. It could even be that I've gotten so jaded about ""stylish"" films that they're all starting to look a little bit pretentious.

I noticed there's a bit of recent backlash to all the ""10 star"" ratings and cult status of this film. Not unexpected, and maybe the reasons I've given above have something to do with it as well. As moviegoers, we've seen this kind of film a bit too often now, and it's lost some of its power to frighten or shock.

Anyway, I'd still rate this movie highly, but I'm not so sure it's a masterpiece. A very good movie, yes. Worth watching, without a doubt (particularly if you enjoy this genre). Somehow I can envision John Malkovich playing the ""John Doe"" role... he might have done very well, and certainly would have been interesting in the role.",8

16 November 1999,"Wonderful movie, just one notch short of a classic.","Se7en is a very excellent movie. The cinematography is outstanding, and combined with the production design it creates an extremely dark and bleak village (I don't believe they identified it). The screenplay is intelligently written, the direction is well done also. Though Brad Pitt, who to this date I have seen him act well only once (12 Monkeys), is not very convincing as detective David Mills, it doesn't really matter. Morgan Freeman is incredible as always, playing his calm, cool and wise character he has mastered in every way. Kevin Spacey is breathtaking in his small but pivotal role. He does his best supporting work ever here, he was only better in The Usual Suspects, and possibly L.A. Confidential.

The film starts out on a crime scene, where we are introduced to detective Mills (Pitt) and Somerset (Freeman). They talk, and we learn that Mills is new in the force, and that Somerset is a veteran that is retiring within the week. They don't get along well, and when they find a mysterious murder (an overweight man was forced to eat spaghetti until he burst, and the word gluttony is found written in grease on the wall) Somerset suggests he be moved to a different case as well as Mills. This is denied, of course. The 2 find a couple other murders with words written bizzarely on the walls or the floor, and they deduce that the murders are linked to a serial killer who kills according to the seven deadly sins. Though I saw the censored version on ABC and probably didn't get the full effect of the movie, I still think I have a pretty good idea of the movie's quality. It's brilliant. So then why is this movie only a 3 out of 4? There are missing links to the story, and sometimes there is too much relying on suspension of belief. However, you must see this movie, if not just for the last 20 minutes where we finally meet John Doe, the man behind the killings who to the amazement of Mills and Somerset hands himself in and volunteers to give a full signed confession to all of the crimes. The catch? To take Mills and Somerset, alone, to the scenes of the last 2 ""killings"".......",7
11 December 1999,The greatest movie I refuse to ever watch again.,"""All this, and he still has Hell to look forward too...."" Oh, man. Whoever wrote this movie is one sick puppy! A BRILLIANT plot where the murderer takes out his victims by way of each of the seven deadly sins. This movie makes you want to crack open a bible and hop the God forgives you for taking part in this EXCELLENT spooky movie. Textbook definition of a psychological thriller from start to finish.

Heady and stylish serial killer/cop thriller with brash Pitt and retiring Freeman embroiled with a string of murders all having in common the motif of the seven deadly sins. Surprising moments of truly unnerving suspense outweighing many plot devices and been-there, done-that situations. Nifty production design and a stand-out perf by Spacey. Unsettlingly dark and dour photography thanks to Darius Khondji and one creepy title sequence. Directed with dank elan by David Fincher.

15 May 2005,"Dark, uncompromising Hollywood shocker","SE7EN

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1

Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDS

On the eve of retirement, a world-weary cop (Morgan Freeman) teams up with his younger replacement (Brad Pitt) in the hunt for a monstrous serial killer whose crimes are based on the seven deadly sins.

Dark, gruesome shocker, with Freeman as a burnt-out cop struggling to make sense of the horrors he has witnessed during his long career, and Pitt as a headstrong character whose flaws lead to a devastating climactic 'twist'. The drama unfolds in an unnamed city where goodness and mercy have surrendered to human apathy, allowing a killer to fester unnoticed, until his monstrous scheme overwhelms the central characters. Andrew Kevin Walker's ingenious script works both as a police procedural and as an examination of society's moral vacuum, though the downbeat ending may strike some as too neat and cynical for its own good. The movie is quite shocking in places - the killing derived from the sin of 'lust' is particularly degrading - though it's also quite playful in its own twisted fashion (note, for instance, how the constant rainfall surrenders to bright sunlight for the horrific finale), and Darius Khondji's elegant widescreen cinematography belies the movie's grim subject matter. A triumph for director David Fincher (following the misguided ALIEN³), this is as close as 1990's Hollywood ever came to a 'daring' mainstream blockbuster, and nervous viewers are urged to avoid at all costs.",7
10 August 2008,Amazing yet Awful,"To be quite honest, i don't know what to give this movie. seldom has there been a movie i wished i could unwatch, and this is one. but never has there been a movie i wish i hadn't seen because of the degree of truth in it.

The acting in this movie is phenomenal; Pitt and Freeman really make you believe in their characters, which is the reason this movie is so terrifying. This movie makes the viewer confront the evils of society through the acts of a proclaimed ""mad man."" As you watch this movie you are instantly assumed into it, up until the point where you feel the pain of the characters.

This movie made me look at a world i didn't wan to see. It essentially sucked the joy out of my day, and i am forced to ponder who in their right mind could write a story with this degree of sickness. Yes it is a good movie, but i don't think it is necessary in a day and age where the pain in our world is already all too clear.",1
27 January 2022,exceptional,"Seems like a while seems watching this but was surprised just how exceptional it is. I wonder if perhaps it might look a little less but it really is wonderful. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and all great as well as Gwyneth Paltrow and, of course Kevin Spacey. Andrew Kevin Walker, the writer may not have none everything as outstanding. Howard Shore probably as good as The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and the cinematography of Darius Khondji also as good as his earlier Delicatessen (1991) and also Richard Francis-Bruce was have noted how good is editing on The Shawshank Redemption (1994).

24 September 2005,Seven is a Ten,"This is the film that single-handedly made me think of David Fincher as a great director, all of his subsequent films only cemented the deal of him being one of my favorites. Brad Piit & Morgan Freeman as Detectives Mills and Sommerset are after a devious, grisly killer who murders his victims based on the Seven Deadly Sins (Sloth, Greed, Envy, etcetera, etc..), in this extremely well crafted, gripping, suspenseful thriller, that never falls into the one tap that these thrillers too often fall into, which is letting the audience get ahead of the plot. ALL of the actors in this film are superb in their respective parts, including Kevin Spacey who gives his best performance of his career, just slightly edging out his part in ""The Usual Suspects"" in my mind. It also features one of the greatest endings that I've ever witnessed. Moreso, the entire film has a kind of poetic beauty and sense of grace that comes off it that is simply mesmerizing and makes this film one that is simply a sheer joy to come back to again and again. A must see modern day classic, no matter how you slice it, this movie comes with my highest recommendations.

1 September 2012,A mind twisting tale,"If you will see this movie the first thing will come into your mind will be""Oh my god"". This is a tale of a serial killer and let me tell you this one is quite different from other you seen. This guy (kevins.) is looking so intense in the movie. Though the story seems fit to the characters but the creepiness of the main idea is very unique....!! And like always brad pit is looking handsome and morgen is intelligent but kevin is a winner in this movie. when i saw this movie last night i wasn't thinking that it will be so intense like its review says on IMDb but just after watching it for 30 min. it gripped me in such a ways which words can not define. this is movie which you will remember for a lifetime and discuss with 1000 people and everyone will have the different theory for the characters but i bet on that - everybody will be agree on the idea and the intensity of the movie. A must watch if you like the serial killer movie and light blood n gore but i bet the idea will more hit you then this. I am giving it 10/10!! Best in its category.

20 March 2014,A relentless tour through hell,"The origins of my love for cinema began when I started to discover many films similar to Se7en, ones that really provoke mass discussion long after seeing them. That overwhelming necessity to really explore the deeper meaning of the movie. They don't just aim to entertain, but to challenge opinions and push people to comprehend short-comings in society.

When the young, cocksure Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) moves to the city hoping for a more thrilling line of police work, a string of murders are set in motion. He is consequently partnered with the diligent veteran, Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) to resolve the case, forcing them to put aside their differences to end the sequence of events, only to become pawns on a much larger board.

Throughout the feature you get the feeling that these are two very different walks of life, the generational divide in their work methods are shown clearly. Whilst Somerset is cultured, world-weary and methodical, Mills is very impulsive and head strong, aiming to make an impression within the force yet not having the same determination when investigating. A montage shows Pitt's character is struggling to concentrate at home, meanwhile, his elder is shown pouring over books in a library, making reasonable headway with the case.

This is no buddy-cop movie, it's unrelenting and brutal throughout. Although all the murders happen off-screen, the events are retold via the crime scene investigations and photographic evidence which enhance the aura of mystery around the killer, building up to the final chilling performance by Kevin Spacey as their very own John Doe. Blank of regret and emotion, he fits the performance perfectly as you can see the criminal exuding delight as the detectives are forced to pursue him through the grisly cat and mouse game.

One of the ways that Fincher expresses how twisted the city-living can become is by the similarities between the characteristics of the 'insane' Doe and the disciplined Somerset. They act as two parallel examples of how someone can deal with a poor hand. Where the detective originally set out to better the world via law enforcement, using his intellect to prevent misconduct, John Doe executes a series of pre- meditated murders using his knowledge as a message to the masses. Their cynical outlook on how humanity has become so apathetic is resolved in two completely polar ways, their likeness fascinates me.

I believe that part of David Fincher's plan when filming this was to hold a mirror to modern society. For us to scrutinise why, when murders are committed, we show no empathy? Horrors and tragedies are a staple fixture of the world today and much like Fincher's 'Fight Club' adaptation, it questions the very core of how compassion seems to have become less predominant, replaced by a love for money, consumerism and our own well-being. How accustomed we have become to awful events described by various media outlets on a a daily basis. All roles perfectly delivered by all actors involved. The ending flawlessly ties all loose ends within the plot whilst delivering its distressing climax, undoubtedly still provoking debates over a decade after its initial release.",9
15 July 2002,Alarming. Down right chilling. The count begins.,"Absolutely one of the best shockers to come along in a very long time. Two detectives(Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman)work in tandem trying to track down a ruthless serial killer, whose modus operandi is inspired by the seven deadly sins. Some very graphic after-the-fact violence. Pitt and Morgan could not appear more realistic. Very strong language is atmospheric in this crime drama. Don't be ashamed if you flinch, hide your eyes or redecorate the chair you're sitting in. This movie is powerfully good. Also in the cast are: Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey and Daniel Zacapa.

2 July 2005,David Fincher does it again!.! ^__^,"Se7en is a reflection of our everyday life, we live in a world filled with media & information technology which makes people often live beside each other instead of with each other, even though the serial killer is portrayed as the devil in this movie i can empathize with his feelings/opinion about seeing sins on every corner of the streets. The intellectual, patient personality that's Sommerset & the young rebellious ""let's dance"" Mills really contrast each other, creating interesting character development.

We as the audience are confronted with biblical/religious statements throughout progress of the film concerning homocide cases, if Sommerset had to choose a playing card then he'd retire as soon as possible, he's been doing detective work for way to long, but however he does get motivated by the unusual case of 7 sins that are about to unfold including all the plot twists & turns.

Se7en has been directed with unusual grimmy & dark look, during the film it's constantly raining, as if time never seems to change the mood is captured with great directorial vision, the dark & wet apartments that seem to be abandonded for ages, a combination of brown & black colors recreating a new kind of innovative film noir, consciously leading us to unique cinematographic history.

Sommerset comes to terms with our serial killer John Doe & even though they might agree on certain points when it comes to the subject of everyday life, these 2 characters are worlds apart at the same time, in a sense that John Doe murders his victims using the 7 deadly sins.

Pacing of this movie is nice but if you're expecting a big action movie, perhaps you're better of watching a vin diesel (XXX) movie. We're invited by the director to be intellectually stimulated, while the story develops we must think along, asking ourselves new questions about every single horror murder committed as we go.

With that said the film is in my humble opinion highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of the acting skills of Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman, it's got quality(not much though)action, dark mood, acting, story development, character development, mystery, among others. Even though not for the faint hearted, since some scenes of the committed murders are visually shocking to say the least (adult rated), Se7en is a great police drama by director David Fincher. * * * * * * * * * 9 OUT 0F 10 STARS !",9

4 October 2019,"Bleak, thrilling and crafted to perfection","David Fincher's Se7en isn't just your ordinary detective investigating murders and trying to catch the killer film. It's much more than that. What makes this movie really stand out from the rest is the impeccible direction by Fincher and unpredicable nature of Andrew Kevin Walker's script.

Se7en is the story of two detectives who investigate murders committed by a serial killer who uses each of the Seven Deadly Sins to kill his victims.

After Alien 3, which Fincher doesn't consider as his film, Fincher creates a film that's jarring, disturbing and leaves a bad feeling in your stomach. His use of dark, ugly colours uplifts the depressing tone and the sound design makes Se7en feel as close as possible to reality. This film isn't one to forget easily. What sticks with you is the film's underlying message about the sadistic and violent nature of our world. How crime is rampant within each city. All of this is shown visually which makes me admire the way David Fincher helmed the movie.

I loved how far Se7en went in terms of its content. The aftermath of the murders are disgusting and give you the feeling of throwing up. The filmmakers didn't shy away from all the gore and this made me appreciate the film even more. In spite of the investigation taking up most of the film, there are some great character building moments as well. The scene taking place at a bar and the dinner scene strengthens the bond between our two leads and help us learn more about their personalities. These scenes made me genuinely care about Pitt and Freeman and that feeling made the ending seem even more shocking than what it originally was.

Aside from the aesthetics, the acting here is simply superb. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt create wonders together. Their acting seems really believable and elevates every scene they're in. The killer, I won't mention who, surprised me when he showed up and for the short amount of time he's in the film, he steals the show. His motivation is well realised and well though out which makes his character fleshed out and someone who'll make you think deeply regarding the cruel state of the world.

Se7en is a total winner and one of the best mystery thrillers to have ever been made. Everything is done to perfection and it wouldn't have been done without the direction, acting and screenplay. Se7en will get under your skin and stay there for a really long time.",10
16 March 2021,A thriller movie with capital T. David Fincher's best work ever,"Seven completely revolutionise the concept of thriller genre. Apart from directing - which is simply beautiful - the very strong part that strengthens the movie making it spectacular is the fabulous acting. Very perfect choice of actors, from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman till the amazing and talented Kevin Spacey, who was absolutely perfect for the role in the film. The story is so thrilling and perfectly balanced with a screenplay well written, with many dialogues that make freeze the blood. NO SPOILER: what make this movie so great is also the disturbing and beautiful ending, one of the most studied and best shot. So sad it only received one nomination for best editing at the Oscars, he deserved much more than this!

27 October 2014,Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Lust. Pride. Envy. Wrath ... What's Your Deadly Sin?,"Blazingly original, darkly disturbing, downright shocking, extremely grim, relentlessly brutal, insanely powerful & emotionally devastating, David Fincher's breakthrough effort is an intensely haunting masterpiece which today is widely & rightly considered amongst the greatest thrillers ever made, and is also notable for marking the commencement of an impressive legacy that continues to get stronger with every new Fincher film.

Taking place over the course of a week, the story of Se7en concerns two homicide detectives; the soon-to-retire William Somerset & the newly transferred David Mills, who become deeply involved in the recent case of appalling crimes relating to the seven deadly sins and desperately try to hunt down the sadistic serial killer before his mission is accomplished. The plot also covers the detectives' initial friction with each other & the contrast in their working methods.

Ingeniously directed by David Fincher, the film is a staggering work of perfection from start to finish in which the smallest of details end up contributing to the whole premise & the dark plot in itself feels like something that was spit right out from the abyss. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker is very carefully but masterly structured with each event, character, their motivation etc being properly weighed before it is penned down in the script.

Coming to the technical aspects, production design team does a stellar job in providing the decaying & dismal environment to the whole picture which is further enhanced by its bleak photography that adds to the inhospitable look this film was aiming for. Editing makes sure every sequence is relevant to the plot & smoothly unfolds the events as the film progresses while Howard Shore's score effortlessly elevates the nerve-jangling tension to a nearly unbearable level.

As far as performances go, Se7en features a very dependable cast in Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow & others but what truly makes it work is the remarkable chemistry between Freeman & Pitt as Detective Somerset & Mills, respectively. Freeman plays his character in a very calm & composed manner and is instantly likable. Pitt does go a bit overexcited in few scenes but his performance still stays within the realms of his character's dimensions.

Yet it's actually our serial killer who ends up stealing the show from the moment he reveals himself to the audience to the very twisted, bone-chilling & unforgettable finale that's powerful enough to haunt its viewers for a long time. Also, the opening credits sequence alone is in an entirely different league as the sense of creepiness it invokes only serves as a warning for what lies ahead and the film as a whole works immensely well as a fascinating meditation on evil.

On an overall scale, Se7en is one of the darkest, creepiest & finest examples of psychological horrors that remains as effective today as it was back at its time of release. The extent to which its story tries to delve into the minds of serial killers is pretty unsettling yet the uncompromising approach the director took in envisioning a sinister script on the silver screen makes it all the more admirable. A dark, brooding & unrelenting terror of epic proportions, Se7en is certainly David Fincher's darkest film to date & definitely one of the greatest achievements of its genre.",

28 September 2020,I wish there were 14 sins so we could get a sequel!!!,"This is one of the best movies of all time.

It has a wicked story (in every sense of the word), its confronting, creative, dark and sinister.

But there is one reason this movie is so good.

The Performances The Performances The Performances

They are so blunt, deep, emotional, damaged, arrogant, dismissive, connecting and truly truly brilliant.

26 March 2021,Timeless Thriller,"An original thriller that follows two detectives, one at the end of his career and the other just beginning, thrown into a very disturbing serial killer case involving the use of the seven deadly sins. The construction and execution of this film is second to none along with the performances. Like the crime case itself the film is riddled with hidden clues and metaphors that open up the more times you watch it. Like John Doe says ""What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever."" The same can be said about the film.

8 May 2022,One of the best investigative narratives I've ever seen.,"One challenge that investigative films face is staying interesting so the viewer doesn't find it boring and tiresome, and here's an example of a film that easily overcomes that challenge; Fluid, cohesive, intriguing, impacting and well executed, from the beginning he already arouses curiosity, and this remains until his last act that is surprising to anyone.

Its technical aspects are also surprising, setting, filming, soundtrack, performances; The whole set is very well aligned, making the whole experience and immersion better.

Really good movie, worth the time and attention invested.

9 November 2016,The Quintessential Psychological Thriller,"What can one say that, I'm positive, hasn't already been said about this film? That taken into consideration, I will review this title regardless.

Seven, from start to finish, is a film that ""Will Be Puzzled Over, Studied, and Followed... Forever."" That is a quote used in the movie to describe the crimes that ensue(d), but I feel it works quite well as a tag-line for the film itself. The Film is set in semi-modern New York and revolves around two characters - Detective David Mills & Detective William Somerset. (David being a transfer/""rookie"" and Somerset, the hardened veteran) The plot consists of Mills and Somerset trailing a serial killer by way of varying but distinct clues left at each scene. I personally believe that Seven lacks in no definitive aspect or area; it is (in my opinion) perfect in every way and a true classic that should be enjoyed by everyone - and I would be more than willing to debate this statement any time, any day. Breakthrough roles, more than incredible cinematography, plot line and supporting roles with awe- striking scenes, twists and developments at every turn.",10
8 August 2003,Major League Disappointment,"I tried to keep an open mind while watching this film, but once the mysterious plot twists and turns lead up to the climax, I was unimpressed and anxious for the movie to end. This film is only interesting to people who enjoy all-star casts, unnecessary violence, bizarre images, and boring plot line. This is a typical '90s film. There was one scene that scared me to death, so you might want to check the film out for that reason only. Other than that, don't see it and expect anything good. I did, and I was completely disappointed.

The effects are also amazing the tone of the films is bleak at times but I like that in films so this one is definitely highly recommend!

17 January 2007,disgustingly good,"Seven is about two detectives, one old school, and one new school, who are placed on a homicide case together. Things start to get very strange as the killer turns into a serial killer with a definite pattern. After the inevitable whining between the new partners, they start to actually do some good work together. The murder themes are the seven deadly sins and each murder is executed according to one of the sins. Some good special effects and really disgusting scenes make this film not one for the kids. I've watched this film several times because each time you pick up more visual effects. They finally capture the calm and cool killer who plays on the younger detectives frailties very well pushing all his buttons while the old guy tries to keep things from escalating. The twist at the end is well worth the rest of the film. If you don't like sick and disgusting mutilations, stay away from this film.

5 September 2020,What Did I Watch?,"This is the second David Fincher film I've ever seen. And I know this review is going to get a lot of hate, but it's irresponsible of me to use my free-speech rights to review a movie and not be truthful.

Fight Club I could forgive for its pretentiousness, as the characters who drive the plot think and feel just that way. Having read the book, that's a pretty faithful translation to the screen; there's an inflated since of importance about everything in that movie and, although that importance is largely unjustified, it's all in the perception of the character. Fight Club just feels like an extension of this film (because Seven came first), even going so far as to have the one and only Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) starring alongside the irresistibly fantastic Morgan Freeman.

Well, irresistible... except for this particular movie.

This movie (and, in fact, my overall impression of David Fincher's filmography) is so up its own ass that it's a film almost entirely catered to either stoners who watch movies like this to comment on it being ""so deep,"" pre-established Fincher fans, and film students. This is a film made to be studied, whether it's worthy of it or not, and it feels like that's the target audience of his films. People literally worship this man and the work he's done, so far as to analyze his films frame-by-frame for references and, sure, there may be some cool things scattered throughout this film, but what good are they if the film is so bloated, uninteresting and uninspired that it can't even be bothered to create sympathizable characters before getting to the action.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are one-dimensional cardboard cut-out characters. They show up, they do their thing, and then they leave. There's no depth to the characters, absolutely no character development whatsoever and, by the end of the movie, the only emotion that it actually stirred within me was anger, because I lost two hours of my life on this nasty, pretentious piece of work.

Of course it's unpopular to say, but this film was an absolute pile of trash from start to finish. Were it not for the fact that the copy I was watching came from my library, I would've snapped the disc as soon as the credits started to roll. I like a movie that doesn't have an inflated sense of self-importance. Faking it till you make it is fine, but once you get to the place where you can have a major studio fund and distribute your work (which Fincher had), it's time to stop making movies that literally stroke your own ego. It's unattractive.

I'm glad I can now say I've seen this movie, but I'll never sit through even a single scene of it again in my life.",1
20 March 1999,Nothing new,"Seven has become a huge public success all over the world. That I can understand. What I find more surprising is that it also got well received by the critics. Most praised it as well made, exciting and original thriller. Some even thought it was a masterpiece. But in my opinion, Seven doesn't provide the genre of police thriller noting new than dim lighting and copious amount of rain.

Because Seven has much more in common with other films in this genre than most people realized. A couple of clichés are that there's a team of two cops who investigates the case consists of an old black man who is tired of his job and look forward to his retirement. The other one is his opposite; a young white man who wants up.

The murders that Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) are investigating has been done with the seven deadly sins as source of inspiration. The killer also leaves short literature quotes. Mainly Dante, something that makes Somerset (of course the intellectual of the two cops) take Mills (who only seems to read Guns and Ammo) to the library.

Director David Fincher - whose only feature film before this was Alien 3, but loads of music videos behind - reasoned ""I don't feel at home in libraries either... What music should I pick? It has to be something cultural. At least we take something that everybody recognizes - Air by Bach.

Seven doesn't have any other intentions than being the two hour thriller with some disgusting corpses, an odd police couple and a crazy killer it actually is. Then it should be regarded as such and nothing more.",3
11 June 2011,One of the iconic films of the 90's,"IMDb Top 250: 27

Seven, David Fincher's first great film, is about two detectives in an unnamed city who hunt down a serial killer who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his modus operandi. It's an original and clever take on the murder mystery. When those opening credits start to roll, with an awesome remix of Nine Inch Nail's 'Closer', the viewer begins to both dread what will come next, but also be unable to wait to see how it unfurls.

A very important part of Seven is its setting and atmosphere. The city, unnamed intentionally, is a savage, crime-riddled town that no one wants to live in. It sets the perfect landscape for such a bizarre killer. The direction is wonderful: constant rain, dark; this is a sad, dreary place, and no good can possibly come of it. It's one of Seven's greatest strengths.

Another great strength is the three major players. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the rookie and the veteran, and both are very convincing. Pitt, a five year veteran elsewhere, comes to the city intentionally with his girlfriend. We feel his unpreparedness, especially early on. He doesn't know what to expect from this dreary place; his reaction to the vomit and him waiting for Somerset outside the Gluttony murder, in the rain soaking with two coffees proves that. While some criticize Pitt's acting at the end, I think he aces it.

Freeman doesn't have as hard a job, he is the perfect smart and wise character. The last player is the killer, who I will keep a secret. From the killer's entrance to finish, you will be on edge as long as the character is on the screen. The lack of emotion is unsettling.

Visually, the film stands out: colours are seeped out of the picture, leaving darkness and rain: a great example is in the alley, with cameras facing up the guns barrel into the rain.

The last key to Seven's success is the plot. Full of action, suspense, and a few jumps, you will be engrossed by this story till its intense, shocking finale. Each of the killings are well-thought and shown in a gory, visceral matter, but not explicitly so. Sloth and Lust are absolutely atrocious in a good way, but I think Pride could have been fleshed out a little more. That could be the only suggestion I have about the film.

The less you know going into Seven, the better. One of the 90's best. 9.6/10",10

17 July 2007,Not a good film,"I don't know what the hype was about, I think its one of those films that just because it has those faces we love in it, then we take for granted as good. I did not feel that sense of mystery I was promised, no new chords were struck. Those last scenes which were supposed to be the climax, was the worst part. I mean did Brad Pitt only have the choice to shoot or not shoot Spacey? Could he not have just about hurt him real bad?....which in my opinion is a far more exciting form of vengeance and makes a hell of a lot more sense than killing, because death is the end to pain. And Spacey's character demanded that of him, so he triumphed. Morgan Freeman had warned him that he he was not fit for the job. Anyway finally I would like to know why we don't see Paltrow's head in the box in the end, its not like that would be any more gory than what we had already witnessed.

24 April 2020,The ending can't be beaten,"The whole movie was a very enjoyable experience with great character development and and a good story. It wasn't until the end that this became one of the greatest movies of all time. Jon Doe is an extremely interesting villain where he is properly introduced on the car ride leading to the finale. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman's chemistry as partners is like no other. The finale, in my opinion, is one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever created.

24 February 2011,Why do people watch this movie?,"I always take the trouble to write an IMDb review when I think a movie is too horrible to watch - the good ones, I am sure people can find them without me.

This movie is rotten to the core. It does not entertain a sensible mind. It does not uplift. It has not humor, no fun, no moral. It is morbid, depressing, meaningless. But it is not meaningless like, say, life. Life's meaninglessness has a depth, it is somber. The meaninglessness of this movie is like a small child killing a white rabbit - wanton, senseless, rabid.

What did you learn from this movie? What did you enjoy? What moved you? Nothing unless you admire gore and violence per se. Yes, the acting, especially of KS, was superb. But I do not see any glamor in superbly acting the part of a mad killer. The mad killer can do it himself.

Anyways, I am rambling; but after a movie like this, you are at a loss for words. You wonder what kind of people spend a million dollar on a movie like this. You wonder what kind of people go to watch it. You wonder, most of all, how someone can enjoy spending money on this rather than giving some money to, whoever.",1

16 August 2020,"My God, what a film!","No nonsense, straight to the point. Now that's how you make a thriller. The rainy background makes it a perfect watch on a rainy day. Jaw dropping scenes, gripping story and fantastic performances coupled with the best dialogues you can find in a film. My, what crazy dialogues. Luckily, today we can ff, rewind as many times as we like. That's exactly what happened with this movie. I kept on watching the same scenes multiple times for those Golden lines. Fantastic. Took me 4 hours to complete the film. That's the sign of a Masterpiece

26 October 2013,That's how thrillers should look like.,"(Sorry for bad English)

Se7en is unique. Usually after watching good movie I want to see it again, but not in this case. This movie shocked me with violence, it gave me so many emotions that i don't want to watch it one more time, I never thought that just a movie can scare so much. Most of horrors novadays doesn't scare so much as Se7en. Storyline is awesome and actors play very good, especially Bradd Pitt in final scene - unforgettable. Morgan Freeman always play well and so he did. After watching Se7en you will start to compare all thrillers with it. By the way I watched Se7en about a year ago but I still remember it very well and I still don't want to re watch it. This film definitely is not for everyone. If you're going to watch film just for fun or with family - choose another movie. Se7en is for serious audience.

19 March 2022,Overly Repetitive.,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",5

6 October 2020,Do you understand how legendary this movie is? And how it will keep on living for decades?,"I wouldn't give it a perfect 10 but gosh darn if it wasn't a close 10. This movie is so timeless as it will keep living on for generations to come. Even when you know the suspense or the ending, you will still come back to this marvelous piece of cinema. Man, I love David Fincher, there's no movie of David Fincher that I don't like, except Aliens 3(well we can't call it a 'Fincher').

I wouldn't talk in length about the movie, the story and all, what some other reviewers like to do. I would just keep it simple. The way they hid the identity of the serial killer and how they handled the promotions was brilliant. You had to be alive in 1995 to understand that. How much of a surprise it was to find out who actually was the killer. Anyway, let's not give it away for some users as many of my friends still haven't seen this movie so I can only assume how many are out there like him.

Morgan Freeman is power man. He doesn't have to do a lot to control a scene. He doesn't have to go out of his zone to command a scene. He just does it. 30-something Brad Pitt is fire as well as the 50-something Brad Pitt. This man has kept his acting consistency throughout the year.

Can we appreciate my second favourite director, David Fincher? What a master. What an absolute genius. So less people talk about him man. So less recognition given. The Social Network is still called the best movie of the decade and it wouldn't have been possible without Fincher. Screenwriters are a big part of his direction alongwith the lighting. A rather unnecessary part for a director to control but he controls it.

You wanna know my favorite Finchers?

26 May 2008,"Its rainy,dirty,scary,agonising,sinister and brilliant. One of the best films of the 90's","Sensational.Amazing.What else cam i say?Superlatives do not do Se7en justice.It marked a return to form for director David Fincher after Alien3.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are superb hunting the crazed John Doe serial killer.When i first watched this film i went straight to the door to make sure the lock was secure.It messed with my mind. David Fincher said in an interview around the time of its release that he wanted to make a film that scarred people like Jaws. He certainly achieved that in my book.The film lingers long in the memory after viewing it and that is a rare thing in todays throwaway Hollywood disposable film production.I own Se7en on DVD, its not a film that i would ever watch to cheer me up but its one i'll keep going back to remind me how great films can be. 10/10

9 April 2006,#42 of all time? Not a chance.,"I had been waiting a long time to see this movie and I finally had the chance. #42 all time? 8.4 on IMDb? Man it must be GREAT.

Instead, what I watched was a slow, almost boring movie. Where were the great twists? It was amazingly predictable. Guys print on a wall? Bet he's missing a finger or hand. Guy starved to death? Bet he's still alive, why else would they so lovingly pan over the body? Friday the 13th did that, too. Nice serene music and BAM! I wasn't counting on Seven being a ""slasher film"" but it sure seems to have followed many of the ""tricks"" of cheaper slasher films.

There was some character development, I guess, and i'm sure that slowed things down a bit, but that hardly made this a great film.

And why was it so damned dark half the time! IT ISN'T NECESSARY! Man I hate that in movies.

Anyways, i'm sure some will love it. I found it totally run of the mill, with a lot of wasted star power.",5
5 August 2023,Not without flaws,"I'm moving Se7en's rating from 10/10 to 8/10 after the most recent rewatch. I still love the suspense, the atmosphere, the damp and dark city of New York with its continuous raining, Morgan Freeman's turn as det. Somerset and the third vicious act of the script. But I found some parts if the film rather silly and childish, such as treating Chaucer and Milton's poems as occult, a pop and superficial perspective towards religion and mysticism as a whole, and I found Pitt to be largely unconvincing up until the very last minutes. Simply put, this is not the flawless masterpiece that I once thought it was.

The ideas, puzzling mysteries and gun action makes the movie great until the last scene of the movie comes. If you watch this in the morning and after that you have no appointment to meet someone, DON'T see this movie or the last scene. The ending is the darkest one I have ever known. If you do want emotionally challenge yourself, go for it, and you'll be regretful. Still the movie is super interesting. Just the ending...

4 July 2013,Haunting and visually poetic,"I'm a little late to the party with Se7en, as I first watched it just this year. One of those things where it's been in the queue forever and I'm slowly working my way through. Anyhow as a result of my procrastination, my ""experience"" of the film was slightly desecrated, but my appreciation was not. I realized just before I reached the massive twist of the film that I saw what was coming. I don't even remember who spoiled it for me...but oh well.

The only reason I address this is the final scene of the film is by far the most talked-about aspect of the film...by FAR. And I didn't think it was greatest final act shake-up I've seen, but the movie itself is incredible.

My favorite part of Se7en is it's stylishness. David Fincher delivers a beautifully noir aesthetic to the piece that colors the entire story. And my other favorite thing about Seven is the surreality of the nameless, ever-raining, Gotham-like, hellhole city where our mystery unfolds. I cannot overstate how much I love that story-telling choice. It gives the film an immeasurable sense of dread and intrigue. Aesthetically, simply a masterpiece.

Se7en's other major strength it its leads. The script doesn't over-talk anything; it's economical and concise, but provides just enough chemistry for it's protagonists to make this ""buddy cop"" film stand out. Pitt and Freeman turn in some of their most thoughtful work and play excellently off one another. It's a character piece that succeeds without dwelling too long on exposition or any forced ""bonding"". Their relationship develops naturally, and in the face of abject psychological chaos, calm moments are brief and rare.

I suppose it would be unfair to not mention Seven's creatively macabre components as well. I realize I didn't include a synopsis, but if you haven't already heard it 100 times from cinephiles and review sites, I'm sure it's somewhere on this page. The killer in Seven patterns takes inspiration for his murderous work of art from the seven deadly sins, and dispatches his victims in accordance with said sins. But the bizarre and disturbing, (albeit not explicit) murders are still a means to an end. The film's really about the tone, characters, and noir feel. 8.1/10",
20 May 2019,This One is a Masterpiece!,"I know im kinda like 20 Years late for writing that review... But its never too late. The Story is kinda disturbing and emotional, but this Cast acted perfectly to bring everything so close to the Watcher. One of the best Movies ever.

19 December 2015,David Fincher and the Se7en deadly sins,"David Fincher's great style of directing, a movie that's brilliantly dark and it's superbly acted. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are a pairing couple or opposite personalities and Kevin Spacey is the villain we all love and hate, such a great performance. Intelligent writing with no clichés and the imagery of the grotesque never descends into thoughts unnecessary gore or sensationalism. Brilliant cinematography with a bleak tone, the film has a sense of dread and some moments are climax. Se7en sticks with you in your and it's really unforgettable. The plot keeps you hooked until the most terrifying final moments you will ever see. It is scary because it uses your imagination against you in a deep, deeper level. A classic crime thriller that remains uncompromising no matter how many times you watch it.

28 December 2006,The world is a scary place.,"With this movie and 1999's ""Fight Club"", David Fincher cemented his status as *the* most visually creative director of the 90's, and one of the most original, inventive and compelling storytellers working in Hollywood. If ""Fight Club"" was the ultimate theme park ride for repressed white collar slaves, ""Se7en"" is the haunted house. While not a horror movie per say, it is infinitely more frightening, emotionally scarring and disturbing than anything that George A. Romero, Dario Argento or Hideo Nakata could possibly offer.

From its first frame, ""Se7en"" sets its tone with Fincher's bleak visuals, moody weather and Howard Shore's slow, atmospheric music (you won't believe this is the guy who would go on to make the unforgettable Lord of the Rings score). It's a visual masterpiece, throwing you into an anonymous, dark city which seems to be the Nirvana of the dregs of society. In the middle of the city's violent everyday chaos an invisible John Doe has set a horrible plot in motion, his goal to punish seven unrelated people for their crimes, turning their own sins against them (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Envy, and Wrath). Working methodically, patiently and intelligently, Doe builds at his murder masterwork, piece by piece, slowly drawing police detectives Somerset and Mills into the web. Somerset (played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman whom I usually detest) is the hardened, cynical veteran who's about to retire, Mills (Brad Pitt, exceptionally good) is the rookie who's troubled by his own naive personality and hot temper. The ""unlikely partners"" thing might sound clichéd by now, but trust me, you won't even notice.

What makes the movie so compelling are the fantastic performances from a diverse cast, an utterly unpredictable, frighteningly sadistic plot, intelligent scriptwriting by Andrew Kevin Walker, and David Fincher's superb direction, which is unlike anything you've seen before. Fincher shows an uncanny ability to keep the viewers at the edge of their seats, creating, through the use of visuals and music alone, an angsty, forceful sense of unease which lasts until the film's shocking climax. Anyone who thought Brad Pitt was all good looks and no talent will have to take it back after seeing him convince beautifully as Mills, and Freeman's character is, for once, not the sugar-sweet know-it-all he's typecast himself as. Gwyneth Paltrow is also good as Mills' wife. But it is John Doe who leaves the lasting impression - the uncredited actor (whose name I won't mention, in tradition with the movie) gives a monotonous yet completely spellbinding performance and you find yourself understanding and sympathizing with his motives far more than you'd want to admit.

Se7en is grisly, sick and depressing, although most of the horrific violence is only implied, never shown. However, the aftermath of the murders - especially the revoltingly sadistic Sloth - is often enough to make you lose your lunch. This is a feel-bad movie and it's proud of it. You cannot watch it expecting another ho-hum, by-the-numbers thriller in the vein of, say, ""The Sentinel"". ""Se7en"" is depressing, frightening, shocking, fascinating, original, and it features enough talent acting-, direction- and script-wise to fill a hundred Sentinels or Domestic Disturbances. Bring some friends with strong stomaches and watch it - if you dare. But make sure you'll be able to sleep with the lights on.",10
2 December 2013,A stupid film for stupid people,"The film is for children, needing to be spoon feed every ten seconds the next step, victim. Like most crime films the writer/director feeds the view just enough information to avoid giving away the story even when such restrictions are illogical and unrealistic.

The film is utterly disconnected from the realities of a major criminal investigation. We're expected to believe that NYPD would assign only two homicide detectives to what is clearly a serial killer.

In the real world dozens of detectives would be assigned. The FBI bought in. Crime scenes would have their lights turned on (instead of the melodramatic and never ending use of torches), and instead of following like hansel and gretal the crumbs the killers has left them they would be following real leads.

Canvesing, obtaining the CCTV's surrounding each victims house for several blocks. Establishing a when the killer was there and working out where he came and went to. Like another review mentioned we are asked to believe that this killer makes absolutely not a single mistake and that no one has ever seen him.

However the films great crime is the belief, even after his home base and money is found, that killer continued to kill and work with nay a concern for being caught.

Its utterly ridiculous and anyone who can watch this film without realising its utter crap is utterly deluded.

Even most of the I hate it Reviews on IMDb complaints are banal and vexatious. Subjective things like tone, narrative and photography are well personal choice you either like em or you don't but they in themselves don't make the film good or bad.

A good intelligent film treats the viewer with respect.

Lastly the constant ripping on Silence of the Lambs (there are several comments in the film that refer to SOTL) when this film is far more of a marketing puff piece is an utter joke.

I've deleted this film, and refused to even watch the much vaunted ""twist"". That in itself so utterly illogical and stupid part of the plot that its not even worth discussing.",1
30 October 2009,David Fincher is a master,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10
7 October 2022,Very Poor Film Making,"Here you can see excellent actors giving terrible performances. Brad Pitt was so wooden in this role it was painful. His dialogue delivery was unendurable. Morgan Freeman was not much better. This was such an exercise in putting out such a pile of steaming rubbish it's almost laughable. Almost. As for the story itself it wasn't too bad. The execution of it is where everything falls apart. No adherence to basic police procedure. I know it's just a movie but still credibility has to enter into the proceedings at some point. This just gets worse and worse until the big finale which is such a disappointing flop it's incredible. Paltrow turns in yet another mundane forgettable performance. Nothing but stink on stink here.

3 March 2022,Deadly sins,"The seven deadly sins, where do I start? This methodical killer is precise leaving hellacious destruction in his path with sick twisted mind games for the detectives to unfold. Each victim has a sin placed beside him/her with reasoning unclear at first sight. Each death more sick any twisted by the minute. My reasoning for finally giving this a viewing and rating not only because it was on my to do list however daunting it seemed, was because tomorrow I am viewing Matt Reeves's The Batman whom took influence from se7en. This is my first viewing of se7en which deploys a gritty noir tone whilst maintaining style and letting off a disturbing nature of inhuman intellect. What I would say is once the killer is uncovered there isn't really much of a twist just a fine line between insanity and sanity. This antagonist asks the questions on what makes one so innocent? What makes you so different from me? Of course in any homicidal maniac eyes he is never the villain, he believes himself to be doing gods will, a saviour if you like. So let's get to the film, Brad Pitt was a stand out performance for me as Mills reaching a variety of emotions throughout the film. Mills feels incapable of giving up on this case and sees the killer John Doe as insane, he has no admiration of any action taken by the killer. (Morgan Freeman) plays Somerset who is equally keen to bring John Doe down but is wise enough and been in the game long enough to know this isn't gonna end well. Why couldn't he have just god damn retire already? I can feel him thinking this in his approach and acting. The world is a dark place for Somerset whilst in addition to almost retiring he can see the intellect of the killer and the methods to his madness. Somerset knows the killer isn't mentally insane just strategic and evil. Morgan does a splendid job alongside Pitt as a polar opposite, he is the more composed of the two, the more experienced and logical thinker. Kevin Spacey brings a very eerie performance of the highest magnitude, he has memorable moments leaving you stunned with mesmerisingly compelling believable acting. (Gwyneth Paltrow) Tracy is Mills love interest however she feels alienated in a new city whilst her man is tracking down the killer. Tracy feels like she is a burden and can't open up to Mills about this whilst he is so busy on duty. I felt her performance too, it really added layers to the script with themes of isolation and loneliness. Overall the film as a whole has stylish backdrops and locations with a very noir feel, fantastic acting and deep psychological thinking. Different views are explored through a variety of characters.",9
8 September 2013,Se7en,"Se7en (David Fincher, 1995)

Here's a movie I last saw about 15 years ago, yet my memories of it are vivid and intense. Watching it again this weekend brought all that back. Morgan Freeman is great as the retiring detective who contrasts Brad Pitt's character excellently. Se7en starts off as this sort of typical police procedural that would not be out of place in a Law and Order episode, but it sure as hell doesn't stay that way. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is given little depth, which may be a flaw but I haven't decided yet. The various fates of the victims are psychologically terrifying. To say much more would spoil the final scenes. Generally I can take or leave the whole crime/horror genre--it just isn't always my cup of tea--but this film is deeper and more raw than most. 8/10

22 July 2020,A dark and complex work of art.,"Se7en is one of those films that masters it's tone. From the get-go, with its use of imagery and atmosphere, you are thrown into this grimy realistic world. The film never lets go of this razor-sharp tone and doubles-down on its dark themes. The use of rain and dirty city life perpetuates its message to the audience about the world. All of these points are a testament to the immersion of this film.

Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have very good chemistry together as a police duo and set the stage for intense moments in the second half of the film. The other supporting actors also work extremely well and the end of the film has one of the best character reveals in the history of film, but I will not go into detail on that to avoid spoilers. The acting from top to bottom is superb.

David Fincher is one of my favorite filmmakers and Se7en is near the top of the list of his works. The directing is tight, the writing is fierce, and the execution of its themes is as efficient as it comes in film.",10

19 June 2023,WHATS IN THE BOOOOOX?????,"Seven is a true cinematic milestone, and arguably one of the greatest thrillers ever made. This dark and chilling film transcends the genre, leaving an indelible mark on the audience. Directed by David Fincher, Seven is a relentless descent into the depths of human depravity and obsession. The film is propelled by the outstanding performances of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, who deliver a riveting portrayal of two detectives caught in a cat-and-mouse game with a sadistic serial killer. Pitt brings a raw intensity to his role, capturing the relentless determination and emotional turmoil of Detective Mills. Freeman, on the other hand, exudes a calm wisdom as Detective Somerset, providing a perfect counterbalance to Pitt's volatile energy. The chemistry between them is palpable, enhancing the film's suspense and emotional impact. The plot is a meticulously crafted tapestry of darkness and despair, delving into the darkest corners of the human psyche. The infamous seven deadly sins become the chilling framework for a series of gruesome murders that shock and disturb. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker is a masterclass in storytelling, leading the audience down a twisted path towards a climax that is as shocking as it is thought-provoking. Fincher's direction is nothing short of exceptional, creating a hauntingly atmospheric world that immerses viewers in the gritty underbelly of urban decay. The film's visual style, accompanied by a haunting score, amplifies the sense of dread and unease. Seven is a deeply unsettling and visceral experience, examining the nature of evil and the moral complexities of the human condition. It leaves a lasting impression, forcing audiences to confront the darkness that lurks within society and within themselves. A true pinnacle of the thriller genre, Seven will forever be revered as a benchmark in filmmaking, with its powerful performances, masterful storytelling, and unrelenting suspense.",10
10 July 2013,A beautiful way to be deadly,"If you want to get obsessed about the seven deadly sins this is the movie you've been waiting for. Have I never would imagine, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman to produce a fine team work in acting. As well as Kevin Spacey for his role as the villain.

It's a film about a maniac serial killer that uses seven deadly sins as its reference. As you can imagine, seven deadly sins brings seven deaths and that's just about the amount of victims in this movie. Brought to the eyes of the viewers perfectly till the end.

The movie starts with gluttony, and then greed, sloth. lust, pride, envy, wrath comes to follow quickly as the films pace increases to the end. Every death/kill is brought beautifully. The set is as representative as it can get to describe you the sin.

A film that gave me a real hype about what it wants to deliver. Surely must watched movie. This is one of the best film I have ever watched. 10/10",10
21 May 2016,Highly overrated Fincher Crime/Drama,"This film serves as a stage for a nice thriller's premise, a serial killer who commits his crimes with the theme of the 'seven deadly sins', the ever popular biblical concept. Throw in Brad Pitt, the young hard-nose copper and his associate, the more seasoned, gathered Morgan Freeman who serves as a token of maturity and intellectual analysis, Gwyneth Paltrow as the always worried lovely blonde, and the villain, portrayed by an excellent actor who, quite honestly, makes the ending into anything good at all. The movie is too long, too bloody/gory for no good reason, the off-plot filler dialog is awful and irrelevant, why with such a theme for the film they couldn't think up anything compelling for their protagonists to say ?? The ending revolves heavily around certain characters, and besides the fact it's terribly acted out by Brad Pitt particularly, it is an escalated climax to something that hasn't gained enough momentum to really be dramatic. We get what the film-makers were trying to do, but considering everything that could've been achieved, this is but a pale, over-long, hollow and quite unprofessional rendering of what it could've/should've been. Solid film still; still a solid premise and relevant enough to warrant a viewing.",7
10 July 2022,Overrated,"While this is a great movie, I think it is a little bit overrated and definitely not Fincher's best work. The first hour and a half is a somewhat basic cop drama with some interesting thinks sprinkled within. It is still a good cop drama in that respect but it is made quite a bit better with a pretty good mystery and some interesting philosophical ideas between the characters. Everything converges in an excellent final act that puts everything together very well and overall makes the movie a lot better in the end.

7 December 2006,Probably the best thriller ever made,"Se7en is one of my all time favourite films. You cannot fail to be completely drawn in by the thrilling story of two cops on the trail of a sadistic murderer using the seven deadly sins.

Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, but Brad Pitt also shows his strengths rather than just being a pretty face! Director David Fincher unleashes a horrible reality of a dangerous - but also clever - serial killer, who doesn't care if he is caught or not.

Gwyneth Paltrow is watchable as David Mills' (Pitt) wife, but the real star of the show is Kevin Spacey as John Doe. He portrays this part superbly delivering such depth into the character you can actually see into his terrifying and gruesome world.

A final nail in the coffin brings with it a great ending, which sends even more shivers down the spine of those who have witnessed this truly exceptional and groundbreaking film. Terrific.",10
28 April 2001,murder mystery/thriller,"A very dreary, feel-bad movie, overly long and hard to follow with a nauseating ending. I seldom hear so much good about a movie, then turn out so disappointed. Would be boring, except that it continually sinks lower and lower, finally doing away with the only comforting thing in the film... leaving everyone, including the audience, feeling utterly alone and positively screwed (betrayed?)! Maybe good for fans of, say... David Lynch, but this film focuses much too much on the seamy side of life without actually doing much more than glory in its own dirty dinginess---wallowing in it!

6 October 2004,It's hard to comprehend. But no one can deny it.,"Directed by David Fincher.

If this film had a clear-cut protagonist, I'd say it would have to be Somerset. The characters come to the surface as Mills (Pitt) is paired with Somerset (Freeman), Mills being an overconfident, cocky Detective and Somerset being the more laid back, methodical and wise.

Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely as Tracy Mills, who hides her being pregnant to her husband but seeks advice from Somerset. What's interesting is to see how vile ""the city"" was portrayed in SE7EN. Somerset quits because he can't take it anymore. Paltrow doesn't want it here, but she couldn't tell David to have them go back home because she doesn't want to be a burden. It is the perfect symettry of the underlying theme of sin, and how the killer uses capital punishment and how he uses his work to preach.

If you haven't seen this movie and haven't been spoiled, mind you there is almost nothing that is gonna prepare you for it. The ending is not for the squeamish... Fincher portrays the final scenes with ominous nuance and beautifully photographs them. Wonderful early-morning scenery in that deserted setting.

Fincher, as a former music video director uses his technical expertise on cinematography, editing and he does it very well, as every shot of this movie is brilliantly crafted and edited in. That low-angle ""worms eye view"" shot of Doe pointing his gun on Mills's head. The temporal snippet of the shot of the slide of Mills's pistol snapping back as he fires it in the final scenes, the taut editing of Mills kicking the door to Doe's apartment. Reminds me of Forest Whitaker opening the safe in PANIC ROOM, right when he pulls it open, the movie cuts RIGHT INTO the safe. And many other beautiful shots in this movie...

This is NOT a feel-good movie, so if those kinds of movies are your bread and butter, you might want to pass on this one. But then again this movie is too great of a film for you to even miss.

I said Somerset is the protag of this movie. He is. You'll see his arc during his VO, the last line said in the film.

You may find the ending of SE7EN hard to comprehend, but it is something you will remember and can not ever deny.

28 December 2008,Extremely thrilling movie! Very Entertaining,"""Se7en"" may be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The idea is very original and intense. The movie is not boring for a second. You will be entertained the entire time. This movie is definitely not for most people, but if you like violent and thrilling movies, this is a definite see. This movie came out a long time ago, but it is up there as one of the best movies in the past 20 years. Kevin Spacey plays an astounding performance as ""John Doe"", the serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a purpose to murder. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as well play excellent roles in this great movie. This movie is one of my absolute favorites and I could watch it every week and never get tired of it.

2 November 2022,Se7en..the epic of the seven sins,"How beautiful are those films that make you want to know the end while you are still in the middle of it, those films that surprise and shock you as soon as they end and do not get out of your mind easily. Ernest Hemingway once said, ""The world is a beautiful place, and it's worth fighting for."" Well, I only agree with the second part; With these words, the ending scene of one of Hollywood's greatest crime and mystery films was drawn. Se7en is a drama and suspense movie that was shown in 1995, which managed to make a wonderful mixture of several components, including the dark presentation style that harmonizes with the events of the film, the intense and focused plot and its development from beginning to end and the polished acting, all of these factors were in response to the wishes of the genius director David Fincher, who is considered This movie is a bright spot for everyone working on it.

One of the greatest crime movies in history.

29 January 2000,"Sick, Depressing and Boring","I can't understand what the critics saw in this film. It's basically a standard serial killer film full of cliches (old cop on verge of retiring and young eager cop full of new ideas -yawn) but with two main differences - the ending, and the sheer grossness of the murders.

I've watched many horror and crime movies and I'm not squeamish but I found the murders so unpleasant that I became detached from the movie and started wondering. . The disgusting crimes combined with the general darkness and mumbled dialogue made the whole film depressing and hard to care about.

As for the ending, it only served to remove any suspense that had been building up. I didn't find the last few scenes shocking or surprising - I realised what was coming and just wanted it to be over.

Well made - maybe. Well acted - perhaps (if you could make out all the dialogue). Innovative - yes, but not in a good way. Imaginative - yes, but not the kind of imagination you want to dwell on. Watch only if you actively enjoy being made to feel miserable.",1

Unclear things, especially what happened to woman with baby, why is she so little shown in the movie and almost only talks. Nothing happening. CSI tv series are much better. Only bit mysterious and bit of action and bit good actors. This will motivate me to watch oscars by speeding up or skipping parts of movie, because this is not 1st bad oscar, but probably 50th or 100th, and not worth completely watching even for the IMDb medal.

I hadn't seen anything like it and the ending....well I just couldn't believe it and I had never been affected like that whilst watching a movie. Fast forward to the present day and I am a lot older and have seen a lot more films, surely I wouldn't still get those feelings would i? For the first 70 or so minutes, this a gruesome, atmospheric movie, with fine acting and one thrilling scene. The last 40 minutes or so take this into a whole different ballgame and that ending. It is still as shocking to me as it was 20 odd years ago. The acting, writing and directing are all superb in this and I am so pleased I watched it again after a long time.

30 July 2003,The most overrated movie of the 1990's,"After watching Seven, I wish that I had the quiet peace of reading about Jack the Ripper or the Zodiac killer. In short, Seven is a grotesque dumping ground of sadism that is packaged brilliantly, thanks to some solid writing and an all star cast. If Morgan Freeman weren't onhand, this movie would have been forgotten long ago as it's perversion is too mentally ill and mind numbing to contemplate. His performance adds a slim philosophy of hope to the movie and his presence domiantes even though he is supposed to be in the ""mentor"" role. The rest looks like it was shot through the bottom of a urine specimen. The death of the gluttony victim repulses the audience and the death of ""Victor"" molests the audience. Brad Pitt is a dynamic dude (pro wrestling lifers will read into that one) and his charisma crackles. Gwentyth Paltrow has nothing to do other then be a plot point. Kevin Spacey looks more then comfortable (as usual) playing the lunatic and his introduction in the police station is an all-time great. Seven's problem is that it's message is pathetic. The world sucks. OOOOHHH!! Haven't heard (or seen) that one before. The acting is great, the dialogue works (until Morgan Freeman starts talking about aliens flying out of John Doe's head) and some of the visuals are tremendous. Other then that, I put this movie in my ""rusty knife"" category.",

14 April 2009,"good at turns, but not worth the hassle","Two detectives try to hunt down a serial killer who seems to be attacking his victims using the seven deadly sins.

David Fincher at the time of Se7en's release was the man known only as the director who destroyed the Alien franchise, and quite right. Apart from a stunning final that showed his potential there was simply a collection of medium shots with none of that vintage scene stealing fast montages and flashes that would become so effective in his future release Fight Club and Panic Room. So there was a bit of pressure on here as casting renowned star Freeman and most recognized newcomer Brad Pitt about a delicate and interesting topic, and he didn't disappoint many. Seven is now renowned as one of the finest horrors ever made.

Starting off with a detective retiring and an ambitious but naïve new cop surprise surprise we have tension. This has been handled in so many films it is ridiculous and if you're expecting anything different in terms of this pairing, think again. The tension between the pair is obvious, the predictable gung-ho attitude by Pitt's Mills is soft and Morgan's law-abiding Somerset is simply boring.

So here we have 'drama' and as both are on the hunt for a serial killer we have 'crime' and the mystery man is attacking his victims with the deadly sins and so we have horrible murders that would label this as 'horror'. When reading descriptions I noticed this was labelled as one of the scariest films ever. I however didn't seem to find what was so scary. Sure the concept would have been scary if the murders had been effectively established but the pair of detectives hardly seemed bothered. They were mere happenings that stumbled in their way. This is a shame as this is a debatable topic that questions religion, social class and humanity. Apart from blood messages, you won't be jumping behind the sofa any time soon.

So Se7en simply tries to tackle too much. Horror, crime and drama are all encoded and seemingly not enough; the inclusion of the rain drenched city places it in noir too, as does Gwyneth Paltrow's flat protagonist. Impressive scene settings and costume design but when there is no plot there is no give, no adrenaline to match the mood.

There is also a lack of action in this 1995 picture. A full hour had passed before my head was inclined to be entertained. Then the final climax was finally worth watching. Heart stopping and well acted by all involved made Se7en moderately interesting. But despite this heavily debated climax and odd twists, it is not worth the whole waiting around",5

26 July 2004,Pretentious Pseudo-Noir Schlock,"Quotations from Hemingway, ""philosophy"" about ""the dark side of human nature,"" more yellowed lampshades than I could count, and a totally uninteresting and witless take on the genre. The relentless obviousness and unsubtly of Fincher's homages to film noir were almost insulting.

Oh, as was an offensive scene where Gwyneth Paltrow's character winsomely demands to know Morgan Freeman's character's first name so that she can address him by it, although *he,* an older African American man and if I remember correctly her husband's superior, hasn't offered it. (Isn't perky over familiarity one of the seven deadlies?)

Rent _Chinatown_ and see what a filmmaker can do who knows we're familiar with the genre and builds a devastatingly moving and complex plot around the very fact that his main character thinks he's in a film noir while we see something different going on.

20 September 2015,Nice,"Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes. Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. The moody photography is by Darius Khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi",
9 December 2004,"""What's in the box"" - Still sends shivers down my spine!","Although this film is 9 years old now it hasn't dated in the slightest and has more than likely been the influence for other serial killer films over the years; such as Taking Lives (2004) for that sheer twists value.

I was only 14 when this film came out so I didn't get to watch it straight away, however after being blown away by it's storyline the first time I saw it (in about 1997, I think), I've since watched it several more times over the years and have been impressed every time. Be it by it's fantastic score (e.g. the library scene), it's sharp witted humour (e.g. when the police captain answers the phone with ""this isn't even my desk!"" - a phrase I'd love to use at my own desk at work everyday), or brilliant acting in the form of Morgan Freeman as Det. Somerset.

The only part of this film I didn't enjoy was the ""SWAT"" team scenes. If David Fincher was aiming for OTT from the actors here, he certainly got it (especially from that bloke from Scrubs)

The most compelling part of this film for me, and what stands out the most, is the relationship between Det. Mills and Somerset. Two detectives both with completely different lives and agendas both thrown together to solve the most disturbing case either of them will ever face. It's not a case of good cop/bad cop in this movie; it's more like overeager cop/retiring cop and by the end shocked cop/shocked (no longer retiring) cop/shocked audience.

A truly great film, 9 out of 10 from me!",
4 June 2021,Fantastic sequences,"This movie has the best special effects. It is still great after all these years. The scenes are really natural. Maybe after all these years, part 2 of this movie and Brad Pitt will be produced instead of Morgan Freeman.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face.

There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances.

15 April 2023,Disturbing,"Seven is a masterful and haunting crime thriller that has stood the test of time since its release in 1995. Directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey, the film follows the investigation of a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his gruesome murders.

What makes Seven so powerful is its relentless and unsettling atmosphere, as well as its uncompromising depiction of human depravity. The film's director and cast have crafted a world that feels both real and terrifying, and the story unfolds with a meticulous attention to detail that keeps viewers hooked from beginning to end.

In addition to its impressive storytelling, Seven also boasts stunning cinematography and a hauntingly beautiful score that perfectly captures the mood and tone of the film. Whether you're a fan of crime thrillers or simply appreciate high-quality cinema, Seven is a must-watch film that will leave a lasting impression on you.

Overall, I highly recommend Seven to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and masterfully crafted film that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. With its stellar cast, expertly crafted storyline, and stunning production values, it's no wonder that Seven has become one of the most iconic and critically acclaimed films of all time.",9

12 June 2012,Review on seven,"Are you afraid of the deathly sins? By Dionne van der Nat, Floris van Hoogdalem and Myrte Tjoa

This review is about the film 'Seven', directed by David Fincher. The film is set in 1995, the year in which the movie was released. In which city the film is set, is unclear and unmentioned in the film. The two main characters, detectives Mills and Somerset are played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. It is a thriller which is very well directed and acted.

The film se7en is about two detectives who try to solve a series of brute murders. Detective Summerset is retiring in seven days, the seven days relate to the title of the film and the seven murders committed. Mills, the young detective, is desperately willing to do a case on his own. Every murder committed relates to one of the deathly sins. When the two detectives discover after the second murder they are dealing with the seven deathly sins they know there are some more horrible murders about to happen. Summerset and Mills try and do their best to catch this guy, but are they able to stop him in time? We thought seven is a very good film and enjoyed watching it even more than once. The film is really catching and moving. While watching the film you have the feeling you are really in it and everything in the film is really happening around you, you can feel the terror and fear of the characters. Unlike other films you can relate seven to reality, without knowing everyone sometimes feels or acts like the deathly sins, what if you would be murdered if you did again...?

Firstly, what makes this movie brilliant is that the acting is very convincing in Se7en. The character of William Somerset is brilliantly played by Morgan Freeman. His facial expressions, the way he talks and even his body language makes us believe in the character of William Somerset and he develops throughout the film. The connection between him and Brad Pitt is great and also shows us what a great actor Brad Pitt actually is. David Mills is the young gun in the movie, he is eager to learn and Pitt sells this really well. The two completely different detectives develop their 'bromance' throughout the film and you develop a form of sympathy towards the two. Another great acting performance is from Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Mils' wife. The young actress has to make David Mills feel comfortable in his new surrounding and she tries to do that, although she herself is very insecure. Paltrow might be one of the most important characters in the whole story.

Secondly, the editing plays an important role in the movie. On the DVD version of the movie they show how and why they have sometimes edited the light and shots. When a scene with a negative mood is filmed, they edit the light in such a way that it is very dark at the set. When a scene with a positive atmosphere is filmed the set has been edited much lighter. The head-space of the actors has been chosen with care, e.g. in a serious scene they want to show the whole face of Morgan Freeman to show how serious he is and they also do this in the opposite way to create suspense. The use of the reverse shot is used quite often in this kind of movie, especially when there are interrogations. Se7en is not an exception, this technique also creates suspense, and you can clearly see the intentions of the one who talks. The average shot length in this movie is different per shot and this makes you think about it. The director has done this sometimes to create suspense, sometimes to make things clearer for the viewer. The use of parallel editing is not used that often in this movie, but when it is used, it is very effective and sometimes it shows a surprise.

Thirdly, the use of camera-work is from big importance in the movie. The director sometimes does not show things to manipulate us into thinking nothing is there. The use of reverse shot has been discussed in the paragraph above and this is vital in the movie to show the emotions from the characters during conversations. The way we see the corpses for the first time in this movie is also very well done. The camera is moving very slowly and you will see the grossest thing first. This creates a form of disgust and sometimes leave you breathless. The close-ups are mainly to show that the characters are worried and you can see the desperate look in their eyes. The movement of the camera when the detectives are chasing someone makes you feel part of the action and is therefore used effectively. The angle of the camera is sometimes used to make one of the characters look heroic (low angle) or to make a character look weak and vulnerable. The low angle technique is effectively used when the detectives chase the serial killer and it stocks your breath at that point.

We think this film was really well thought of and very well casted. Everything said in the film really makes you believe the serial killer could stand right behind you. The camera-work is very well done and the music well-chosen. The suspense keeps up throughout the entire film and at the end of the film we were breathless. We think this was a very good movie, and although is was made almost twenty years ago, the special effects are used effectively and the actors are believable. We really recommend watching this film!",8
16 May 2004,"damn, if I was a psycho, this film would only motivate me!","this film is one of the films which you have to see twice before catching all of it and making some sense as the film gives you a lot to think about, even in real life, the ethics, morals, the way of life, etc. This film is as real as reality. I personally don't like some of the remarks that people make about the film. About the justice system, the police procedures and the behaviour of detectives. Apparently it ain't perfect. BUT what is?? This film has pretty much everything you could ask for in a crime/thriller genre movie. The suspense, gore, Reality, originality but most of all logic. The way that the film uncovers the puzzle piece by piece. It pretty much uncovers itself very slowly until Doe walks in. The logic and the everyday life issues that people encounter and don't even realize 'damn, where the hell do we live?!...' ...in a world of greed, sloth, wrath, pride, envy, gluttony and lust.

13 July 1999,A disturbing and brilliant film,"Few films genuinely shock me nowadays, but this did. It is horrible yet fascinating, it fulfills the morbid curiosity which is in us all whether we want to admit it or not. There have been other films about serial killers but none as desperate or dark as this masterpiece.

It is the unrelenting mental will of Spacey's character that chilled me the most. His utter insanity was matched only by his ingenuity and discipline. His character is one of the most truly evil in film history, forget hannibal lecter !

The whole film is brilliantly made, the performances are great, even from Brad Pitt, and the atmosphere is wonderfully set, but there are two particular things which, for me, set this movie apart.

The first is the way in which the city setting they are in is every bit as all consuming and intimdating as Spacey's character. People are swallowed up and spat out in this world, no one counts. It reminded me very much of an Alan Moore graphic novel called 'Watchmen' in which a character called Rorschach becomes a vigilante to clean the streets of the 'scum'. Spacey's character is somewhat like this striving to show people the evil that surrounds them. The irony is that his methods are wholely more evil than anything he wishes to illustrate.

The second is the ending. Never has there been an ending like it to my knowledge. It is hard to describe how it makes you feel. There is no way he can lose, you feel cheated whilst still appreciating the cleverness of the manufactured situation. It leaves you with nothing exactly reflecting how Brad Pitt's charcter must feel at this moment. The film leaves you bewildered and mentally fatigued.

However the perfectly handled ,and completely unique, ending completes an awesome film.It is very downbeat and critical of humanity, Morgan freeman's character re inforces this in his final line, but there was a place for a film such as this and Se7en filled it.",
14 June 2017,Great movie,"This is just an all around great movie. Great acting, original story line. They don't make them like they used to. A good movie I hope they never try to re make. Some movies just need to left the way they are. A Great villain role in this movie and the hero's are both perfect in their roles. A must see

26 February 1999,Somebody hand me a razor blade...,"...so I can put myself out of my misery right now. This is the most bleak, depressing movie I have ever seen. A completely joyless experience. What I wanted to see was a detective story about the pursuit of a shocking series of murders...what I got was an overwritten, pretentious philosophical treatise on the nature of good and evil, with no detective work whatsoever. In almost every scene, there were table lamps that only lit the square inch that surrounded the bulbs; it never stopped p***ing down rain, and everything was cold and dark to the point where you couldn't see what in the Sam Hill was going on. Okay, I get the point already! Yeesh. Bleach. Terrible.

15 September 2015,so thrilling,"Somerset is a detective, who is going to finish his career in a week and he works with a new face, Mills. They investigate a series of mysterious murder and find a clue. A criminal seems to kill people who act based on seven deadly sins, wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and gluttony. Somerset and Mills use a record of library and identify a suspect. When they go to the suspect's house, the suspect appears by chance. The suspect runs away and This is a suspenseful movie and includes a little scary scenes. The director is David Fincher and I think many of his works ends unhappily. Actually I do not prefer this kind of ending so this movie is not so recommendable for people like me. However, as a suspenseful movie, it is so thrilling and enjoyable.

2 December 2002,Grotesque/Beautiful,"This has to be, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful movies I have yet to see.

And I'm talking on it's artistic value. Not on it's less-than-delightful subject matter. Every detail that went into the making of it, from the photography, to the meticulous care with which the props were concocted is incredible. So many pieces, in such an intricate puzzle, that all come together to form a multi-faceted, and beautiful film.

The acting is well-done. While not amazing, I'd have to say each one of the characters were perfectly formed, and played off of each other in exact harmony.

The storyline itself is somewhat classic in its cop-thriller genre. But as you take a closer look, it has been magnified not only to account for the 90's audiences bloodlust, but to step past it, making it seem grotesque to ever want to witness such a thing.

It doesn't hold back in showing true ugliness. Which is something that Hollywood often neglects.",8

29 December 2012,Masterpiece made better by incredible acting,"As a 15 year old, I did not know what to expect from the movie. All I knew is that it was supposedly good and that the actors were the best there are. The storyline takes the viewer on a journey along with the characters. The viewer soon begins to empathise with Brad Pitt's seemingly over- confident character. This is similar for Morgan Freeman's cool, calm and collected camera. This turns out to be significant towards the end of the movie. This movie is no murder mystery like any other, and perhaps not much of a murder mystery at all. This is due to the difficulty that the detectives have when attempting to solve the case. With any other actors, the movie may have been unbearable as it is often slow paced. However the acting was so real and, well, brilliant that you can't take your eyes off the screen for one second. All in all, the magnificent, unpredictable storyline combined with brilliant acting makes this movie a must- watch for all fans of film.

21 August 2020,It's always raining in the city,"It is always raining in the city, but people don't seem to mind. At this point, they don't even notice it anymore. It's not ignorance, they are numb. Yet they still deal with it in one way or another. Detective William Somerset puts on his hat and takes his coat while Detective David Mills just faces it with his hair up. He gets in the car, brushes it off and off to work. There is a killer on the loose, his crimes terrible and the clues barely existent.

Interestingly enough, there is no mention of what city it is. It could be any big city. Bleak, inescapable, apathetic, sad, miserable, industrial and hopeless. Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is close to retirement and Mills (Brad Pitt) is only just beginning his career. He moved in recently with his wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). The two are expecting but David doesn't know. And maybe is for the better. In the city, excitement and agony can often become one another. Besides, the murder victims keep piling up. Mills and Somerset arrive at the first scene: an obese man, fed to death found face-down in a bowl of spaghetti. The word ""GLUTTONY"" is written on the wall. Next scene, a defense attorney, killed after forced to cut a pound of flesh from his body. The word ""GREED"" written in blood. Despite the fact that this should be obvious to anyone remotely interested in learning, it is Somerset who first notices these are two of the seven deadly sins. Next up, ""SLOTH"", ""LUST"", ""PRIDE"", ""ENVY"" and ""WRATH"".

In aiding his less experienced colleague, Somerset does what most people wouldn't do when faced with such a man--he goes to the library and begins studying anything related with the seven deadly sins. At its center, Dante Alighieri's ""Divine Comedy"". He points out how the killer is preaching, his acts of murder being symbolic punishments for the victims' sins. But they are also pretty ironic. One think that David Fincher never focuses on in his movies is the comedy in various situations. He is a bleak, atmospheric, at times claustrophobic director. But this is for the better. Mills points out how the killer is ""urinating in their (the police) faces"". And I couldn't help but think there is also a sense of superiority, jargon and irony in the killer's work--how on-point and also behind the police is to him. It is, indeed, a ""divine comedy"".

But as shocking as the crime scenes are, it is the interactions between Somerset and the Mills family who has the bigger insight--at least until the final scenes. Somerset is a loner, and while he is clearly intelligent and has gone through more than he shows, there are still two times when he opens up. Once, in a bar, when he has a discussion with Mills. Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker had made them with such well-defined and opposing personalities that any contradictions and insightful discussions come naturally. Somerset and Mills discuss about apathy, but they also hint at hypocrisy. Mills, who loves the city life, points out Somerset's superior nature, but Somerset doesn't think any better of himself either. But even more powerful was when Tracy asked Somerset to meet her in secret and told him she is pregnant. Somerset is shocked. Tracy is depressed, she hates the city, she hates the apartment which is often rumbled by the noise of the subway passing and she needs someone to talk to. Somerset sees in her nothing more than what most people feel. The hate for the city, except she simply hadn't numbed herself yet. Like him, but not like David--David loves the city.

And while the deep, personal interactions between Somerset and Tracy are setting up the shocking climax, it is when the killer finally reveals himself that the movie really solidifies its place as a masterpiece. ""Se7en"" had such a high build-up that unless the villain is not perfect, the movie collapses. But the villain--John Doe--was perfect and the movie did not collapse. From the point he shows himself he is in complete control. His physical movements--minimal. his voice--methodical, intelligent, evil! His presence--demonic. Yet his message is blunt enough--sinners, let this be a lesson to you! As he goes on about his motives, you cannot help but look at Somerset listening, silent. He makes the sneaky case of not completely disagreeing with Doe. This would be scary if Somerset hadn't been written and built through the entire movie as a paragon--which he is! Are we really all better than criminals, or do we simply--out of either morality, fear of God, or just fear of the law--suppress our darkest thoughts where no one can reach them?

I care not for the answer. This movie is great simply because it raises the question. The debate is what will make it linger. And let's remember: Somerset doesn't care about the city, he only stretches his job until he will retire somewhere far away. Like Doe, he knows it's hopeless and that there is ""a deadly sin on every corner"" but it is so common now that there is nothing that can be done about it. It will always rain in the city.",10
31 December 1998,Shocking,"This film has taught me to check the rating first. I was completely blown away by the sheer horror of it, and three years later I still have flashbacks. There was a warm and encouraging feel to the film, after exciting credits and introduction to very appealing characters, which could not have prepared me for the outcomes. If ever a film goes down as the turning point in our desensitization to violence, this is it. I hope I never see anything like it again.

16 July 2012,"Se7en gives you a shiver down your spine it is a cold, dark masterpiece.","Se7en is about 2 detectives who are trying to catch a sadistic murderer who uses the seven deadly sins as his method of operation. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both have very powerful characters and perform brilliantly.

The thing i enjoy most about seven is the weird and creepy way the film is done and how dark and disturbing the film is, it really has an affect on you and an affect is what we go the cinema for. Se7en also has a magnificent twist ending just to top it all off.

VERDICT: Simply a spine chilling masterpiece.

19 May 2021,What people find so special about this film?,"It really brings nothing new, it's basically a long CSI episode with no edge to it what so ever. It all was very predictable, and in the end of the day there wasn't a single scene in the movie made me go 'WOW'. It just that nothing felt new, in contrast to what films of that supposed caliber should do. I think most of the love to it is deriving from people tendency to get excited from the two main actors, especially freeman for some unclear reason.

All in all it is a pretty standard movie, that's the problem with it and unfortunately also the only source of it's positives.

I'm not usually reviewing movies, but this one felt so blatantly overrated to me that I felt like I have to.

20 February 2023,This masterpiece wasn't a blip at the Oscars...,"What a sad case of politics they were then and still mostly rubbish now. The cast is not only all star but the story, the witty dark humor, and the compelling visuals are mesmerizing. For all the horror in this film, there isn't much of it on the screen as it is in your mind.

At the time, one of the actors I shall not name wasn't listed because it was more important to ensure that the audience didn't guess who would enter this movie to change its direction. I have to confess that, had I known, it would probably have changed so many expectations.

This film was so well crafted. This is not just two cops in opposite directions, a buddy buddy mismatch. No, this is also about probing many questions seen from two perspectives - the more innocent optimist and the more experienced pessimist. The lesser educated, impetuous youth versus the well educated pacifist. And considering where the world is today, it does have much more to say than just an unusual story. It's like it's preaching to us, as opposed to films today which are nothing more than a slogan on a t-shirt - at best.

They don't make them like they used to, and Fincher's projects are usually less frequent and almost always strong, whether or not you like them.",10
16 June 2006,A little creepy but very boring!,"To be honest, I don't understand what's so great about the movie. I've never seen the whole movie. I don't know why. I always give up watching it during the movie 'cause it bores me. I don't find it exciting at all. Just two policemen chasing a guy. I've seen similar movies that are way thrilling than this. And the reason why the guy is killing are stupid. It's just not inspiring enough for me to make me sit down and watch the whole thing. I always end up zapping on another channel or pick up a book to read. Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor. He's the reason why I'm trying to see the movie every time it goes on TV. But not even him can make me interested to make it through to the end. And Brad Pitt. I can't stand that guy. He's not that good as he think he is.

15 April 2012,"""An exercise in storytelling, visual style and suspense""","David Fincher's dark, gruesome and intelligent thriller Se7en remains one of my favorite films of the 1990s. It's dark visual tone and use of pathetic fallacy coupled with the harrowing story of a killer attempting to teach humanity a lesson is both disturbing and brilliant. Fincher shows audiences his true capabilities as a director, and Se7en is an exercise in storytelling, visual style, and suspense, making it one of the definitive crime thrillers of the 20th century.

The film begins in a miserable and unidentified cityscape, perhaps Los Angeles, or New York. Perhaps it is simply a metaphorical version of all the crime in American urban areas. This city seems – for at least the one week the movie takes place in – perpetually covered in fog and light rain. We are introduced to Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), a young and impulsive cop who was transferred to the city. He is paired with Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), an older, calmer, meticulous veteran to the force with one week left before retirement. The contrasting pair make a nice centrepiece for the havoc which is to be wrecked upon them by an unknown murder.

Their first case together is the supposed murder of an obese man, found bound to a chair, he was forced at gunpoint to eat himself to death. His crime was gluttony. There are six more deadly sins, all of which the meticulous, patient, and above all disturbed, serial killer plans to use as his MO. They are: greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. Somerset, who has a keen insight into the mind of the killer, asks to be taken off the case but remains in contact with Mills as he reads through Dante's ""Divine Comedy"", Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"", and other prose relating to the seven deadly sins. Together the pair of detectives get closer to the murderer, eventually ending in a climax which is brilliantly scripted by Andrew Kevin Walker.

The key to Se7en's success as a crime-thriller is the feel of the movie. Fincher is terrifically talented at bringing to life the most stylish interpretation of the material possible. The sinister atmosphere of the city is only furthered by the grisly murders and the seeming hopelessness of finding the murderer. Even when they find what they think is his apartment they don't discover a single fingerprint. Also vital to the film is the script by Andrew Kevin Walker. He gives Morgan Freeman just enough poetic lines to run with, and the killer presented here is unique. He is intelligent, he writes his thoughts down journal after journal, he is patient, calm, sensible, and he seems to enjoy killing his victims. Interestingly, the murderer is presented with about 30 minutes left of the film, given a speaking role and made an important character, opposed to simply being the unnamed monster behind the killings who is caught at the end. I won't ruin who plays the killer for anyone who hasn't seen the film, just know that it was a smart choice both to cast this actor/actress, but also not to advertise it.

Brad Pitt gives a strong performance as Mills, the younger cop who loses his temper more frequently, but still believes he can make a difference. I wouldn't have liked anyone else to play the role, but I could see a handful of other actors also embodying Mills. Somerset, on the other hand, could not logically be played by anyone but Morgan Freeman. Freeman's calm deep voice, and his presence on-screen is unavoidable. His character more questioning of the supposed good nature of humanity, yet still devoted to catching the killer. He is intellectual, he reads Milton and Dante and Chaucer for clues to the murders, and he thinks before he acts, unlike Detective Mills. This difference in character serves as an essential plot point later in the film.

David Fincher has become internationally successful as a maker of both highly stylish thrillers (e.g. Fight Club, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and more sweeping dramatic films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network. Se7en was Fincher's first real venture into the crime-thriller genre, and it stands as one of his best works. The director is certainly unafraid of being uncompromising and violent, and he shows a strong understanding of visual style and artistic expression. Many shots in this film are incredibly memorable, being just a part of what makes Se7en such an unavoidable film.",9
22 December 1999,"an ugly, abusive assault on the audience","I can point to se7en as an indicator as to what is wrong with American Film today. It is ultimately the work of cynics who, despite possessing a remarkble skill for handling the technological wonders that make up film craft, have absolutely no respect or affection for the audience.Se7en celebrates the destructive power of evil in its purest form. Although the film contains fantastic cinematography and expert performances from the cast (especially Freeman), I sincerely wonder at the motivations behind Fincher and the rest of the creators of this ugly, pretentious and abusive picture. It absolutely wallows in filth, grime and blood. To director Fincher's credit, he has probably come the closest to capturing Bosch on film. If they (the filmmakers) are out to expose the sinful nature of the human being well guess what, most of us already know that- Fincher has us at hello if that is his focus. Much has been written about the twist at the ending. I'm sorry, this ending shows no respect for the audience and their sensiblities what so ever. It makes the two hours one has spent watching this film utterly wasted. Because the most articulate character in the film is the hidden killer (played by an absolutly incredible actor), I wonder if the film makers see themselves as spiritual blood brothers with the pyschopath. The film is dark, unrelenting and completely devoid of any joy, hope or resurrection. Pessimistic films can be extremely effective note The Seven Samurai, The Sergio Leone films, Dr. Strangelove and others, but those films had senses of humour and balance to their pessimism. Again, I ask the motivations of the makers of this film: If you want me to feel dirty, raped and corrupted by the ""real"" world, I already am, I don't need to raped in the ""reel"" world by cynical opportunists wanting to make a buck off of the audience's already jaded spirits.",3
15 December 2020,Be Wrath,"A cleverly constructed crime thriller. Freemen and Pitt have good chemistry as main detectives and Spacey the chilling dead pan serial killer. Great acting and a haunting storyline.

6 December 1998,DISTURBING,"I guess I'm the only person in the world who hated this movie. I can't say it didn't grab me, because it did -- I couldn't take my eyes off it until it was over -- but I was left with a horrible, sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach for the better part of the week. The worst parts were the victims of sloth and lust. What really bothered me was that there was no resolution in the end. I don't go to a movie to be taught a lesson or be disgusted -- I go to be entertained. I can't see that this movie served any purpose other than to shock, which it did.

27 December 2006,Top 10 Greatest Film Ever? For Definite!,"What we have is is why cinema was created. To take you and entertain you and to create emotions... and this along with what I call breathtaking acting, is what Se7en is all about.

Bradd Pitt is his 2nd best acted film (1st being Kalifornia)... and Morgan Freeman being his usual outstanding self.

The standout for this film is it's incredible atmosphere... dark, dingy streets, pouring with rain 24/7, dirty bulding and people... perfect for a nutt case serial killer to ""punish"" people...

Also, it's the only film I can remember that is disgusting/shocking without actually showing anything... you don't see any of the murders take place so it doesn't just turn into some run of the mill slasher film etc.

2 June 1999,Best Detective Movie since Chinatown,"Seven is far superior to serial-killer cliches such as Silence of The Lambs. Seven's graphic morbidness only helps exemplify the realities of the situation. Great acting by Pitt, Freeman, and Spacy. The characters are believable in that they are not perfect or even-tempered;they are real. The movie is real. ...But if you can't handle violence, gore, reality, or political-incorrectness then stick to Mary Poppins.

22 August 2004,The Ending,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",1
18 October 2002,Sad comment on the '90s,"The ratings and commentary praising this disturbing piece of junk are mindboggling to those who have a mind and an ability to discern entertainment. Morgan Freeman is a great actor (What's he doing in this?)and Brad Pitt is a caricature of himself. The best one can say about this ""film"" is that it perfectly represents the self-indulgent nihilism of the Clinton years. It's easy to see why Kevin Spacey (John Doe #1) is/was such a big supporter. Garbage in, garbage out.

20 May 2011,I don't know how it ends,"Once an actor has been in a movie with an evil counterculture end and as the bad guy I don't trust movies that actor is in anymore. Kevin Spacey is one such actor. I was half watching Se7en for a long time while I was doing some work on the computer, thinking I wish I knew the remote control was. Near the end I realized that Kevin Spacey was John Doe but he was in jail so I let it go on a little longer. When I heard Morgan Freeman say that John Doe had the upper hand I had to get up fast and change the channel. I still don't know how it ends.

There really should be a rating system that a movie has a bad ending so that guys like me don;t get suckered into watching crap like this.

14 October 2019,"""I'm Not Special!""...","Seven days before his retirement, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is joined by his replacement, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) on one final case. Said case turns out to be the most challenging, bizarre, and potentially dangerous of Somerset's entire career. Someone is murdering people in gruesome yet significant ways. The detectives run down every clue while more killings take place, and a terrifying pattern emerges. This all leads to the devastating conclusion.

One of the darkest, creepiest, most intricate thrillers ever made, SE7EN is also a magnificent, highly influential police procedural. Freeman plays Somerset as a cop who's seen it all and had enough. Even so, he cannot resist being drawn in to the bleak circumstances unfolding before him. Mills is young, impetuous, and a bit overconfident, not really looking for the nuances that Somerset perceives. Together, they become involved in something beyond their combined training or expectations.

Director David Fincher proves his mastery of gloom, establishing himself as one of the modern greats. Kevin Spacey plays one of the most memorable characters in the history of the genre. Gwyneth Paltrow makes the best of her small but important role as Mills' wife, Tracy. A truly disturbing film, and not easily forgotten, even if one wants to forget it...",
6 February 2004,The best thriller ever,"This is the best thriller David Fincher has made, and most likely the best thriller ever made. The suspense, the atmosphere, the gruesome theme and basic idea of a serial killer killing people by the seven deadly sins is fascinating. The plot is great, you never lose interest, and it keeps evolving for every passing minute. The pacing is great. The acting is great, the actors all do their job perfectly. The characters are believable and their actions are understandable. The whole movie is a cinematic masterpiece, and it truly deserves the praise it is getting. The ending alone has become history in modern film-making; never has an ending been more perfect, more intense or more genius. The whole movie is extremely well-thought out, but the ending alone is a masterpiece. It should be used as an example(and probably is) in film schools, to teach film students how to master true cinematic power. I recommend this to anyone who has just a little interest in thrillers, and who can take the violence. Truly a masterpiece. 10/10

16 December 2000,Why?,"Where did this film go wrong?

It splits into 2 parts: Good and very bad.

The first 3\4's is good. Brad Pitt puts on an acting display that is less wooden than usual and Morgan Freeman puts on his usual thoughtful guy role. It's not Crazy Joe Clark from Lean on Me, but it's a decent role. Kevin Spacey has the best part, but that's cause he's a nutbag. Pitt and Freeman are on the trail of a serial killer who keeps leaving clues in the style of the 7 deadly sins. It's an intruiging plot that has many odd and nasty characters and scenes that are worth watching.

Then comes the end. Brad Pitt's acting falls apart. I would swear that he had just gotten up and read the script 5 minutes before filming. I don't really want to say what happens because that kills the film and I'm not that kind of guy. Let's just say that Pitt walks into a situation that would make the strongest person fall apart. The emotion level should be beyond what humans would normally feel everday. It's horrible. And yet, he acts as if he already knows is like 'Oh man, that's bad. doughnut anyone?' It doesn't help that I figured out the end way before it came up, but I lost any thought of Pitt coming into his own as an actor. See the film, judge it for yourself.",2
8 April 2016,The perfect thriller,"This is the best movie that i have seen of my life. The acting of brad pitt and morgan freeman is amazing. I think that David Fincher could do one the best thrillers of the cinema history. I still see some director trying make something like that, but never it be possible. It has many scenes that will be in my mind forever. Kevin Spacey do a work awesome doing of murderer how also morgan freeman like detective. Without a doubt it has a plot interesting of the beginning until the final. I'd like to watch more film of this style. I'm boring of watch films about super heros and romantics or teenegers like Maze Runner, Papers Cities. C'mon Fincher for more movies like that!!

15 October 2014,"A serious meditation on the nature of evil. ""It is one of the best and most intelligent serial killer films ever made.""","It's powerfully directed by David Fincher, and Morgan Freeman gives another of his superbly understated performances. The filmmakers stick to their vision with such dedication and persistence that something indelible comes across something ethically and artistically superior to The Silence of the Lambs that refuses to exploit suffering for fun or entertainment. The reason to see Seven, which is decidedly not for the faint of stomach, is not for the punishment of sin, but the many virtues of Freeman's contribution. Seven is a work of extraordinary style, upsetting power and narrative daring. The investigation and the clues that lead to the murderer are well thought out and continually provocative. The film is quite involving. David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in film history, far more interesting than Silence of the Lambs. Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give great performances in this film.The pace is fast and the shocks build beautifully. The actors within it all reel with convincing horror.

It's not the identity of the killer that gives Seven its kick -- it's the way Fincher raises mystery to the level of moral provocation. Despite some truly fantastic work throughout the '90s and 2000s, Se7en still remains director David Fincher's best film, albeit by a very narrow margin.",10
15 January 2022,Decent Crime-Thriller,"It's been years since I've seen it, recently rewatched it again. Not quite as dark and disturbing as I remembered it to be but it's still a good film without a doubt.

Great score by Howard Shore, good directing and acting. The storyline isn't all that bad.

7/10.

14 August 2018,"""The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part""","For all those out there that have never seen ""Seven"" there is only one advice: watch it and shiver. For anyone who is a movie lover of thrillers and detectives this is an absolute must see. You must be crazy if one would disregard this movie. I would only advice those people NOT to go see it if they are faint of heart, because this classic has some pretty gruesome killings in it. Although most of those killings arent shown, only the victims are shown, but they are shown in such a horrifying way that I still have to look away at some scenes.

This is without a doubt the ultimate freak thriller slasher movie of the nineties. But mind you, it is NOT that there is much killings to be seen, no the suspense that another victim is gonna be killed rises to levels never before seen on the silver screen. It is what some call a mindf*k thriller and oh man does your mind get twisted with the sick but intelligent plot.

Starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey who all perform at the peak of their talents. Oscars and dozens of awards worldwide were given to this unique piece of suspense horror. One of the most popular thrillers ever released in american movie history. This is something that just mesmirizes and shocks me again and again and I must have seen it over 20 times by now.

The story is about Brad Pitt, playing a young detective married to Gwyneth Paltrow. Brad Pitt has to work with another detective Morgan Freeman to solve a serial killer case. The story sounds simple but the execution of it is mindboggling nervewrecking. I think to this day it is one of the most twisted sick thrillers I have ever seen, but it is directed so brilliantly that is a joy to watch from beginning to end.

If you have never seen this movie you are in a very fortunate position, because the suspense is greatest when you dont know HOW this story will turn out. Enjoy and shiver!",10
13 April 2019,Se7en does not get a 7 for me,"I'm not a huge fan of these types of movies and have not seen many of them, which is probably the reason that I didn't enjoy that much. Don't get me wrong the plot was good, not sure about the ending though which I found unnecessary, but the movie is full of unnecessary murders anyway. The movie lacks the intensity and climax for me, especially at the beginning of the movie where I wanted to stop watching the movie. Its probably my personal preference why I don't like the movie, but I personally believe a dark movie like this needs more thrilling moments to make it more intriguing.

18 June 2008,Seven Very Deadly Sins,"This journey through the mind of a religiously motivated serial killer who kills his victims based on his interpretation of the Seven Deadly Sins is a bit uneven in places, but builds very nicely to its ultimate climax, and I found that the last 20-30 minutes of the movie were very effective as a closure. The open question as the movie came to its end was how the murders depicting envy and wrath were going to be committed. That's done in a quite shocking and horrific way. I can't say it was a surprise - I guessed what was in the box addressed to Mills as soon as the box was introduced - but still it was a grand finale (if one can call it that) to a pretty decent movie.

The performances from Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset and Kevin Spacey as ""John Doe"" were especially effective - which they should have been, since both were pretty standard characters for the actors. Somerset was the experienced, street-wise detective who dispensed advice freely, and Spacey was the - well - kind of spacey, quirky character that he pulls off so well in so many movies. Brad Pitt was less effective as the young Detective Mills - Somerset's partner. He wasn't bad, but somehow neither his performance nor the character connected with me. Gwyneth Paltrow was underused as an actress, although her character (if not Paltrow herself) plays a central role in the end.

The movie seemed to have a bit of a ""Silence of the Lambs"" feel to it, with the serial killer angle and the mind games being played with the police, and the real attention getter through most of the movie was to find out how the deadly sins were going to be represented by the murders that were being committed. I was a little concerned that this had the potential to turn into little more than a gore-fest, but that didn't happen. There are some gruesome shots of the victims, but for the most part the focus was on the psychological dimensions of the story. All in all I thought this was a very good movie; ""Seven"" gets a 7 from me.",7
15 September 2022,Seven deadly sin 🐺,"First of all it is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. Its cast is amazing. So movie starts, Somerset a detective is looking for his retirement and he gets his last assignment. His partner for this assignment is Mils and that assignment turns out to be a homicide. But there is something unique about this homicide, a fat man was forced to eat spaghetti continuously day and night without stopping for a second. He died because his stomach bursts out. It was disgusting, but interesting part was that ""Gluttony"" word was written on the walls of the apartment. Now another murder occurs this time a lawyer and ""Greed"" was written near the body with blood. Intense. Now Somerset reports that both murder are interlinked and the serial killer are murdering people on the basis of the seven deadly sins - Gluttony, greed, pride, lust, sloth, envy and rage. So both detectives start their search for the killer and finds more heinous murders. At last the villain wins and lose also but how that's the thing to watch. Its ending was so great you will be shocked.

18 January 2003,"Strong, Dark and Violent","I had somehow missed seeing 'Se7en' when it went out in the theaters. Now, four good films after ('The Game' and 'Fight Club' among them), this 1995 movie of director David Ficher still stands as an original and strong creation.

This is not an easy film - much more violent and graphic than the usual detective drama. It's a multiple murder story, in an American city of eternal rain, ugliness and violence. The two main characters, played by Pitt and Freeman are fighting a war lost in advance, not that much with crime but with the insanity that attacks normal life. They seem to be motivated more by the need of sanity than by the need to enforce law and morals.

It's great to watch scenes like the one where the detectives and what seems a regiment of policemen are going out to make a search - it tells a lot about the police system dominating our lives. This is the work of a great director, and with such a director at helm, there is hope that even 'Mission Impossible 3' which he is doing now might be a good film.

Pitt and Freeman are great. Spacey acts just for a few scenes, but that's enough to add his picture to the big actors playing serial killers gallery. Paltrow's role, unfortunately, is too conventional to allow her doing an act comparable to her partners.

The final scene is so different from the usual Hollywood ending, that it may shock a lot of viewers. It takes guts to put such an ending to a 'big studios' movie.

9/10 on my personal scale. A great movie, from one of the best directors around.",9
4 November 2000,Not bad,"Not bad for a psychological thriller but the story doesn't show it inner strength, which is cruelty.

Although the movie is about murder by the seven deadly sins, it doesn't attract enough attention from the audience, just like a common drama movie not a psycho movie.

The best performance from Brad and Morgan from one of their earliest movie.

10 October 2021,"Dark, Twisted, Gritty","Not as strong as The Silence of the Lambs, but Se7en is for sure another strong entry to the ""detectives hunting serial killer genre"" and easy one of the best crime movies of the 90s. Fine actors, fine production, and some evil twist make this still a great treat.

24 September 2017,One of the greatest films ever made period,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10

9 October 2004,My new favourite film of all time,"I saw this film about 5 years ago when I was about 12 and never appreciated it because I had trouble understanding it. I realized that I wasn't really listening to everyhting that was being said. I saw it recently and absolutely loved it. I love suspense thrillers that aren't too complicated and perfectly paced. I wasn't a huge fan of Silence Of The Lambs although it is a good film. The same applied with The Bone Collector, which I thought was well paced but had a pathetic ending with a stupid motive.

This movie however is completely flawless. It has great Acting, Directing, Writing, Editing and Photography. I won't delve into the plot as I'm sure you know it. This movie never gets boring at all, every scene is interesting and I think the script is one of the best ever written. I am now a huge fan of Andrew Kevin Walker and David Fincher. Morgan Freeman's performance just about stole it for me, although Pitt and the supporting cast, and the killer especially, were very good (I'm sure you all know who it is but I won't reveal who it is so not to spoil it for anyone.)

This movie is not particularly violent to be honest, it just shows some very graphic bodies afterwards but nothing that is unbearable. The last 30 minutes are what really did it for me as far as suspense and surprise goes. It is quite possibly the best ever twist i've seen in a movie and it works perfectly. Everything that is said in the build up to it by the killer comes true. It is so well-paced and done so it doesn't give anything anyway and you'll be glued to the screen, like I was throughout it. The most important thing about this movie is to watch it when you don't have to leave the room or forget about what has gone on previously. You must listen very carefully to it in order to fully understand and appreciate it. When I saw it 5 years ago I didn't appreciate it enough because I wasn't doing this.

Overall, this is the best murder-mystery/serial killer movie ever made. it definitely deserves to be in the top 100 movies on IMDb and should be a lower number than 54. it should be in the top 10 in my opinion. I keep changing my mind about my favourite film so sorry about that! Anyway, It has everything needed to be perfect as explained above. Go and see this film if you adore your mystery's or perhaps any type of movie. You will not be disappointed.

A definite 10/10",10
21 February 2016,"All in all, You have to see it.","I may not be a Film expert, but as a new English Learner(at pre - intermediate level) when I was 11; I first saw this movie and with the help of adolescence I was touched by it(Not like your uncle did to you).

Morgan Freeman was always my man, but with Brad they made and awesome couple. I watched every Freeman Movie there is and I have to say after Shawshank, This is definitely the second movie.

If you are a simple movie watcher, not reading between the lines, do not bother. Themes between those lines are epic and so clear that it moves. well at least it moved me.

Have Fun all;

16 October 2018,Seven is a Dark winner; but not a Top 250 Film,"Silence of the Lambs. What comes to mind when you hear that title? A deranged genius vs a good guy. This film is similar in many ways, although not quite as polished. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as good guys are fine, and Kevin Spacey as Hannibal Lecter's best student is fine as well. The story is told in excellent suspense technique, and the dark, rainy atmosphere provides the emotional setting that is a proper visual for the screenplay. This film about the dark side of humanity is well-made and a winner. But, that being said; there really doesn't seem to be a lot of socially redeeming value to the content of the film. Is this the purpose of our cinema? To produce depressing, abnormally psychotic films that fascinate audiences. I guess so; it made a lot of money. And after all, isn't that all that really counts in film making?

20 January 2023,"Disappointing ending, but still good","I saw it just now because some people were accusing The Batman (that I loved) of copying it. However, there veery few similarities between these movies aside from been dark detective movies.

The movie Se7en is great except by the end. The end was a bit sloth since it was hardly the detective work that took them to the end of the mystery. Not withstanding, there is a certain doubt at the end of the movie about what truly happened and what will be the future.

Despite this, until the last 40 minutes, the movie has great dialogue, action, mystery, character development and ambience. It makes you wonder every turn what will happen next.

Another bad side is that there are very few characters, thus very few suspects. You know some people will surely get involved because there is no one else to look for.",6

22 May 2007,"Brilliant screenplay, amazing role performances, all in all a definite thriller masterpiece","I wasn't so sure what to expect, either a very brutal and a disturbing movie or an intelligent and an exciting thriller. Well, it was brutal at parts, disturbing at times, but it still managed to be an intelligent and an exciting thriller all the way through, a true diamond for the thriller -genre. The movie tells about two homicide detectives, an experienced veteran detective Somerset who's about to retire from his job and another detective Mills, a rookie who's supposed replace Somerset after he's retired. They soon team up together when they find out that there's a serial killer who commits his murders by choosing victims who each represent one of the Seven Deadly Sins. A perfect plot for a thriller indeed.

I just mentioned about the plot being perfect for a thriller, but does the screenplay manage that perfection? Oh yes, it does. The screenplay (written by Andrew Kevin Walker) is absolutely amazing, along with the whole storytelling. The whole movie is exciting and thrilling throughout all the way from the beginning till the end by not making one single stop or telling any irrelevant subplots. It focuses on the main theme, the whole progress of solving a crime in a very detailed way, making it undeniably one of the best thrillers ever made. Another thing mentioned above is that it was brutal and disturbing at times, but it still doesn't take it over the top. I could describe those parts as being important for the film itself. By showing these brutal things it makes you alert and sort of scared, and really makes you despise the unnatural murderer who's behind the horrible crimes. You really start to live the movie itself, you want to catch the criminal and make him pay what he has done. That is because the absolutely brilliant storytelling the movie has, also giving it a very good flow which causes the 2 hours go in a blink of an eye. That is what a real flow should all be about, making a 3 hour long massive epic movie seem like only a 30 minute short film. That is what ""Se7en"" manages, a flow that's just so good it's a real pleasure for eyes to see.

The directing is close to excellence and it is lead by David Fincher whose work I will most certainly be observing in the future, as I was so pleased on the result he managed with ""Se7en"". Fincher sort of follows the whole story as it should, translating the screenplay on the screen in a very successful and an entertaining way. The movie also got nominated for an Academy Award back in 1996 in the category of Best Film Editing. To be honest, I immediately noticed how detailed it actually was, how it made that flow even better scene after a scene. It makes the whole movie more immense and stirring, backed up by the great cinematography which gives the movie that dark edge it needs. The music's just gorgeous, building up the tension and making your heart beat very fast when there's these highly intensive scenes, giving the whole movie that final touch. It is composed by one of my favourite composers Howard Shore and to be honest the music is very much like Shore. I can't describe it more precisely, but if you're familiar with his work you know what I'm talking about.

Starring Morgan Freeman as detective William Somerset and Brad Pitt as detective David Mills a thriller couldn't ask more from the lead actors. Both role performances are outstanding and both actors are very convenient in their roles. Morgan Freeman happens to be one of my favourite actors of all time and he's indeed one of those actors you just have to admire because to me the man hasn't done one single bad role performance in his career. Freeman is very convincing as detective Somerset, giving the character that Freeman -edge it needs, being wise and witty, a perfect mentor. I must admit that Brad Pitt also happens to be one of my favourite actors and as detective Mills he does a superb job, making the character what it's all about, the one with the looks, being fierce and serious. Both of the characters have this very realistic depth in them. To me Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were one of the best pair teams I've ever seen on the screen, they just compliment each other's performances so well it just almost makes me shed a tear.

""Se7en"" is all in all an amazing movie. Surely one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It's intensive, immense, exciting, detailed and thrilling, just what all thrillers should be like. Everything seems to click in this film; Brilliant screenplay, directing close to excellence, great characters and even better role performances, intensive cinematography and music that just captures the whole essence of the thriller -genre. Despite the fact of it being somewhat brutal at parts it really doesn't matter in the end, it still isn't that tasteless over the top violence the horror -genre seems to have, so you shouldn't even worry about what I said about it. I'm not saying it's a movie suitable for children, I'm saying it's a movie where even the brutal and disturbing scenes are made with a good taste and a classy style. I'd give it a 9.5/10, but as that is impossible it has to satisfy with the more than deserved 9. All this gives you an absolutely guaranteed motion picture experience, it does it smoothly and it does it with style. A thriller among the best.",9
5 December 2020,"""This isn't going to have a happy ending.""","An experienced police veteran and a young detective, who comes in his place, hunt down a serial killer whose murders are based on seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey are enough recommendations for this dark thriller. Great camera and direction, tense atmosphere, scenes bordering on horror, and a good balance of drama and action will keep your undivided attention. However, I think that the reputation of this film is a bit exaggerated and that it is not based so much on the overall quality of the film, but on the shocking final twist that is so powerful and overwhelming that it engraves in memory forever.

21 September 2016,Excellent Movie,"David Fincher reveals a masterpiece of a movie in his film Seven. The movie follows the process of two detectives, Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) as they attempt to track down a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who is choosing his methods and victims based off of the seven deadly sins. The film is high quality for two main reasons: its complex characters and its moral commentary.

The most intriguing character is easily John Doe, the killer. Rather than creating a stereotypical mindless killer, Fincher makes Doe a serious, soft-spoken man, whose power comes from his brain rather than his brawn. Doe is extremely logical and methodical in his approaches, as his killings require intense planning. His character poses as a striking contrast to Mills. Although he is the ""good guy""-the cop, the detective, the one trying to stop a killer- Mills is not likable. Unlike Doe, he raves and constantly shows frustration, and often reverts to physical violence to try to accomplish his mission. Although the watcher probably will still root for Mills, when Doe speaks, they will be more apt to listen. Somerset serves as the voice of reason, reeling in Mills when necessary and respecting Doe's genius as he tries to catch him.

These characters, especially John Doe, perfectly display the film's social commentary on the seven deadly sins within our culture. More importantly, they raise the moral question of what is evil, and what is good. There is a clear clash between good and evil within the film, but the reason it is so successful is that it makes the audience ask themselves questions. Are evil people able to be victims? Is society harming the killer or did the killer harm society? What is a just price to pay for evil doings? Therefore, I highly recommend Seven to anyone who is not too squeamish and who enjoys a perplexing film that will leave you thinking. I enthusiastically endorse this film with an ""A"".",8
18 August 2021,A killer that can kill you by the mind!,"What a great detective movie! One of the best Fincher movie. I really enjoyed each part of this movie. The end was so supsensful and dramatic. Its heartbreaking. Cant say more about it without reavealing some crucial information of the movie. But i really enjoyed it. The investigation is interesting and keep us engaging. Really good movie.

27 December 1999,another film about a super serial killer with powers far beyond those of mortal men....zzzzzzzz.....,"How does Hollywood keep turning out these awful flicks? I guess it's because Jonathan Demme did it right in Silence of The Lambs and came up with a truly terrifying extreme character in Hopkin's Hannibal Lector. But the ""Seven"",s the ""Kiss the Girls"",s ad nauseum flicks that repeat the inane theme of the cops chasing the super-killer who has unlimited resources in both time and finance and can do ANYTHING he wants with no problems that real life throws at everybody else when they

try and do SIMPLE things, well, forgive the run on sentence, but if Hollywood never makes another super-killer flick again it will still be too soon. These guys do not exist. There has NEVER been a psycho-killer with an involved ""relationship"" with any police officer of any police force, and finally, real life serial killers are losers who choose very vulnerable victims at random. The only pattern to pattern killers are that they find victims because many people are nice and trusting and so they become prey to the wolves occasionally, sort of a reverse lottery where unlucky people cross paths with these swine. Why Hollywood glamorizes these creepoids is beyond me. It doesn't surprise me that the same director who annihilated the Aliens series with the inane Aliens-3, directed this flick. I can't wait until he kills ""Rendezvous with Rama"", one of

Arthur Clarke's most enjoyable tomes.",

6 October 2022,Incredible Movie and Pacing,"This movie is incredible for a multitude of reasons. The acting, the premise, but I think one of the things that really sets this film apart is the pacing and deliberate cinematography to create a sense of dread. During the scenes at the crime scene they light the scenes and have the camera follow the lead characters in a way that enables us the viewer to discover the true horror of the acts committed as the lead characters do. We as the viewer are along for the ride and experience the sheer horror and rising terror that the characters experience in the moment.

Also, Brad Pitt's line ""What's in the box?!"" might be my favorite line he's ever spoken in a movie.

21 July 2019,"People will barely be able to comprehend it, but they won't be able to deny it.","'What's in the box?' is probably one of the most devastating well-known movie quotes of all time. 'Se7en' was a groundbreaking thriller upon its release and a lot ahead of its time. Today's post-post-modernist, post-truth and, a post-whatever-cynical era we live now, 'Se7en' feels as fresh as the newest release. That says a lot about the masterpiece (and perhaps even more about the times we live in). A cruel, gritty and sadistically realistic serial killer movie that's message and motives are as meticulously crafted as the crimes depicted in the movie. David Fincher's visual style was perfect to bring such a disturbing story to life. You might not like it what you see on the screen, but you will not be left untouched by it. Appalling and disgusting, yet intelligent. The layered screenplay leaves the viewer in doubt about the morality of humans in general, and what is most frightening, doubt in their own morality. Because with our deepest and darkest thoughts we agree with everything that John Doe says in the end. And we really don't know who to despise - ourselves or, that monster. The two detectives on the case, young and enthusiastic Mills, and old stoic Somerset (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman respectively) form a perfect pair. Mills is cocky and, thus seems careless, Somerset is always calm and, thus seems not to care. They are both smart investigators and Somerset seems like mirror image older Mills.

I heard someone say about this film that, 'Se7en' is the 'Saw' for the thinking person. I would say that 'Se7en' is really messed up (although masterpiece) buddy-cop movie.

And how lucky was Kevin Spacey in 1995 - getting the chance to act out two of the some of the most infamous movie twists aff all-time in the same year.",9

The movie takes from the viewer and gives nothing in return. You'll be a better person for not seeing it.

5 February 2020,It'll crawl under your skin like maggots,"I first saw Seven when my Finnish teacher showed it to our class. I was perhaps 14 at the time. And it left a lasting impact. This crime thriller, this gothic neo-noir masterpiece where people are brutally murdered according to the Seven Deathly Sins as recognized by the Catholic Church. Down the line it led me to Hellblazer, Neil Gaiman, the whole Vertigo Universe, film noir, Gotham, Edgar Allan Poe, et cetera. But I think it all started with this film.

Se7en is one of those films you can only see once for the first time. If that makes any sense to you. I've seen it multiple times throughout the years, but none of those viewings can compare with the first time, when everything is new, each murder scene is more gruesome than the last, and you have no idea what the serial killer is up to. And in a way it's sad. If i could, I would erase this movie from my memory, just so I could experience watching it for the first time all over again. Its twists and turns are that good. But I can't. And that makes me a bit mad. Which makes it a great film.

I've always struggled with reviewing this film. Usually my friends have at least heard about the film and how great it is, so I only have to warn them about how stomach churning it is. But what do you say about it to someone who has never heard of it, without spoiling something essential about it?

I honestly don't have a clue. Suffice to say, it's one of my favourite films of all time. It's violent, it's bloody, it's absolutely macabre. But it's also the best film Morgan Freeman has ever made. It's the best film Brad Pitt has ever made. It's the best film David Fincher has ever made. It's the best film (redacted) has ever made. Not for the easily spooked, but if you're willing to gaze into the abyss, this abyss will gladly gaze into you.",10
4 February 2012,One of the best thrillers of all time,"I admire this film, I really do. It's setup is not the most original. Two cops, one young and aggressive, one old and weary, try to catch a serial killer, whose murders are frankly a bit too gruesome to really exist. And yet, because of the pure acting talent and because of the storytelling ability of the director, it manages to become one of those films that I will remember until the day I die. It's full of shots and scenes that are just so perfect, so fitting, that they instantly touch something within you. There honestly isn't a single scene that doesn't immediately catch your interest.

So, is it a perfect movie? Actually no. I mainly have a problem with the ending. Don't get me wrong, it's a brilliant ending, one that you absolutely didn't see coming, but the logic behind it is a bit faulty. The rest of the murders were all very poetic, full of twisted justice against the sinners. But the final two... they're clever, in a way, but they don't seem to fit the pattern as neatly as the previous ones. But this is me nitpicking. It's still a brilliant movie, whether or not I would have done the ending any different. And I would have, but I can respect the filmmakers' decision to make it like so. There's logic behind that decision. Whether or not that logic fits the logic of the movie is a matter of taste, really.

So yeah, definitely one of those movie that you have to see at least once. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are both immensely talented actors, the style and cinematography are both flawless and the story is masterful. Highly recommended.",10
7 September 2011,A Ballad for Modern Apathy,"A bleak, gruesome, horrific and clever thriller, and filmmaking of a distinguished kind, it tells the tale of two detectives, one all set to retire, the other at the outset of his career, and their efforts to catch a jaundiced but cunning serial killer using the Seven Deadly Sins as his narrative. As the film begins, we meet Somerset, a painstaking veteran cop who lives a lonesome bachelor's life in what seems like a furnished room. Then he meets Mills, an impetuous young cop who indeed requested to be transferred to Somerset's district. The two men probe an exceptionally grisly murder, an obese man having been hog-tied and force-fed to death.

His sin was gluttony. Shortly Somerset and Mills are examining similarly creative murders concerning greed, sloth, lust and the like. In each circumstance, the murderous means is fitting, and revolting. Somerset deduces that the murderer, John Doe, is using his crimes to sermonize. The look of this pulp meditation is vital to its achievement. This is a very sinister film, the murk regularly diffused only by police flashlights. Even when all the lights are on in the victims' apartments, they shed merely ashen, despondent puddles of illumination.

While the story is present-tense, the set design evokes the 1940s. Gary Wissner, the art director, uses dark blacks and browns, cavernous shadows, lights of sickly yellow, and a lot of dark wood furnishings. And it virtually always rains. In this cutthroat world of darkness, Somerset and Mills move with increasing fear. Somerset perceives that the killer is using ancient literature as a muse, and researches Dante, Milton and Chaucer for clues. Mills opts for Cliff Notes. A leg up comes with Somerset's feeling that John Doe must have a library card. But the stiffs amass, in bitter thickset detail, as terrifyingly vivid as one sees in commercial films. The few twinkles of soul and hopefulness come from Mills' wife One of the most skillfully and innovatively edited contemporary American films, perhaps its most beautiful montage features Somerset in the library researching the Seven Deadly Sins while his friends, the library custodians and guards, share their boys'-night-out loft ritual, with an unexpected blackly comic punch line: When the sequence ends, Fincher hard-cuts to Mills losing his temper at these confounding research materials. The contrast between Somerset's reservedness and erudition and Mills' man-this-sucks horse sense and youthful dopeyness starts to make pretty broad strokes, but there is some charming buddy-cop undercurrent that works without a glitch into the glass sheen of the film's atmospheric tone. It's because Andrew Kevin Walker's script and Freeman and Pitt's chemistry that the film is so moving. For instance, the chasing of John Doe through the streets gives Mills the till-now belated chance to show his bones as an impressive, dedicated cop.

The material independently could've been managed through numerous approach, but David Fincher pinpoints suggestive atmosphere, and Walker writes dialogue that especially for Morgan Freeman is judicious, learned and lyrical. Ultimately, it sinks in that the killer's sermon is being urged directly to the two investigators, and that to appreciate it, they may have to imperil their hearts and their psyches. Fincher's fatalistic noir ballad is distinctive in bringing the killer on screen with half an hour left, and gives him a speaking role. Rather than just being the game of a hunt, he's exposed as a warped yet eloquent enemy, having contrived a hideous plan for finishing his sermon.",8
6 August 2003,If you don't mind some gore check it out.,"Se7en is your run of the mill detective thriller with a razor sharp and bloody edge, though it is not only the gore that sets this movie apart. With an incredible cast (Morgan Freeman, Brad Pit, Kevin Spacey, Gweneth Paltrow, and R. Lee Emery), a sometimes overly slick but competent director (David Fincher of Fight Club fame), and a smart script by Andrew Kevin Walker (8mm) this movie was a much needed shot in the arm for the genre.

We open on Dectective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) at the scene of a violent crime, this pretty much sets the tone. Dectective Mills (Brad Pitt) enters and we learn that Somerset is retiring and Mills is his replacement. This is there ""transition"" period and Mills last week on the job.

These first few short scences are followed by one of the best opening credit sequeces ever made.

At the scene of another horribly gruesome crime we come across a man who has aparently eaten to death. When another, equally heinous, crime is linked to the first we realize that there maybe a serial killer on the prowl. The Race is on. Can John Doe (Kevin Spacey), our friendly nieghborhood psychopath, be stopped before he kills one person for every deadly sin (of which there are 'Se7en'), will Somerset get is man before he is out to pasture, and is there something more to these killings than at first glance.

I strongly recomend this movie, but only to the not so sqeamish. With a dark gritty atmosphere and filthy city as the backdrop to the unconscionable actions of mad man, you should not be let down. This is a highly entertianing film with more than one layer. If you have not seen it you are missing out.",8
21 April 2001,...,"If I had the meer words to describe, I'd be the greatest writer on earth...

This is one of those films that you won't get the first time. You wont understand the evil. The desperation. The philosophy. You'll think it a 5 or 6. But still you'll have this voice in your head telling you to watch it again. And again. Just like that song you can't stop hearing, although you know you hate it. And then it hits you. The ingenious. The brilliant acting from Freeman and Peltrow, to Pitt and Spacey. It's like a whole universe unfolding in front of you. The noir-style. The edgy dialog. The characters, that are all in some sort of pain. The profound understanding, that nothing is going to be alright. Ever.

Fincher, your brilliance is divine.

15 February 2002,masterfully crafted but deeply disturbing,"Sage homicide detective Freeman is one week away from retirement when he's asked to break-in new transfer Pitt, a hothead with potential. The two must quickly learn to adapt to one another after they're drawn into the dark side of human nature when they stumble upon an extraordinarily clever serial killer who punishes perpetrators of the seven deadly sins by turning the sin against them! Some of the film's graphic elements are so disturbing, so gut-wrenching, and so vividly realized that the film is off-putting at times, yet it's so captivating, so clever, and made with such realistic skill and ingenuity that you have to applaud the work of all those involved. A modern masterpiece, quite unlike any other film of this genre. ****

14 July 2006,"Somewhat flawed, but intriguingly disturbing movie if suspense is your genre.","Disclaimer: I saw this on television; and while there was no written indication that the movie was cut, due to the 2-hour (including commercials) format of movies aired on television, up to 1/4 of this movie may have been cut, which may have colored my opinion of it.

This movie shows major flaws in directing, acting, casting, and plot. In the end, to me only the incomparable Morgan Freeman held it together, plus the dramatic ending gives it a lasting place in one's memory. The whole, however, is riddled with flaws -- from, for example, the silly over-dramatic cinematographic effects (lights flickering on objects just because the director thinks that's cool, and dozens of other annoying and distracting visual fancies), to the heavy-handed extremely over-dramatic and loud music (when all that's happening is that a rather routine crime scene is being investigated). This is the sign of either a poor filmmaker or a thin plot; in this case, it was both.

The actors aren't all up to par either. Brad Pitt is off -- just out of his early sex-god roles in Thelma and Louise, A River Runs Through It, and Legends of the Fall, he hasn't quite entirely got his acting legs to play a serious cop role yet, and although he does fine for the most part, there are several ""off"" moments which spoil the flow and realism of the movie. His inconsistency is distracting. Paltrow has not quite got her chops yet either, and this is still the infancy of her career. And Kevin Spacey seems greatly miscast -- Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) he is not. I kept seeing K-Pax or any number of other cherubic-cheeked sweet-guy Spacey roles in this performance, not a serial killer. Plus they used a very skinny, nimble, athletic stunt double (who did not look at all like the very stolid, round-cheeked Spacey) to play John Doe up till the time he is captured and we see his face, which compounds the feeling that Spacey is grossly miscast. (If that wasn't a stunt double, then the character was portrayed in two personas too widely different to be totally believable.)

But then again, Morgan Freeman is a Rock of Gibraltar and can save any movie, even one with as many plot flaws, film-making flaws, acting flaws, and casting flaws as this one. Although I found this movie to be a disappointment (Silence of the Lambs it most definitely was not), in the end it was worth seeing because of Freeman and because of the intriguing ending.

I'd say, if thrillers/suspense (especially disturbing ones) is your genre, by all means watch Seven; if not, you may want to view something else instead.",5
24 January 2003,"A good solid effort, and a lot better than ""Panic Room""","Fincher seems to do one kind of movie - the bad movie. There's the laughably cheesy ""Panic Room"" and the pretentious ""Fight Club,"" not to mention the execrable ""Alien 3"" and ""The Game.""

""Se7en"" is a lot better than these movies. Morgan Freeman gives the film class as per usual, but Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey stink up the screen pretty badly (I must admit I feel an intense dislike of certain actors, and Kevin Spacey is one of them). Thankfully, the plot is interesting, and the ending is very un-Hollywood.

11 June 2019,The seven sins of a serial killer,"""Seven"" features a psychopath who is at least as convinced of his moral superiority and his mission to combat moral decay as Travis Bickle is in ""Taxi driver"" (1976, Martin Scorsese). On top of that he structures his murders along the Biblical lines of the seven sins from the Apocalyps. In doing that he is not entirely consistent. In some cases the sinner is his victim (gluttony), in other cases he forces the sinner to be the murderer (lust).

In search of the psychopath is a couple of detectives. This couple consists of, as in so many films before, an ambitious rookie and an old hand just before his retirement. This maybe a cliché, but ""Seven"" nevertheless succeeds in giving it an original form. The rookie is looking for the usual evidence while the old hand is studying literature in the library in an attempt to unravel the twisted mind of the psychopath.

17 March 2012,Seven deadly sins. Seven ways to die.,"Seven deadly sins. Seven ways to die.

Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) are two unlikely partners on a mission to find and stop a disturbed serial killer whose crimes are inspired by the seven deadly sins.

One sin after another is punished through the killers' series of grisly and twisted murders. Meanwhile the detectives are strung along by a series of clues that lead them to each of the next attacks. Finally the killer is captured, but his delusional mission is not yet complete. There is still one final, chilling act remaining which he hopes will strike at the heart of a world he believes to be rotten to the core with sin.

Kevin Spacey plays the maniacal ""John Doe"" in this cult classic. His character is convincingly troubled and troubling all at once. But Spacey isn't the only highlight of the film. The movie is excellently acted all around and Freeman and Pitt are at the top of their games.

The films horrible crimes are described in graphic detail and you are left wondering after each one which sin will be next and in what creatively insane manner the killer will strike. But there is no way to predict the shocking twist ending which undoubtedly played a large role in catapulting the film in to cult status.",8
25 December 2021,A truly masterpiece. David Fincher's work is a detective thriller that certainly enters the group of the best in the genre,"Written by Andrew Kevin Walker (who comes on the scene quickly as the first corpse we see in the film), Se7en is set in an oppressive, gray and harrowing world that seems determined to constantly remind its occupants that life is cruel, unfair and without sense. It is in this context that we are introduced to Detective Somerset (Freeman), who, a week before retirement, faces yet another murder scene with resignation and exhaustion, leading his day with melancholy until he can return to the solitude of his empty apartment at night, when, to get to sleep, he activates a metronome whose oscillating tick gradually drowns out the chaos of urban noises that invaded his room.

With the credits closed, Se7en returns us to the never-identified metropolis that hosts the story and which is built by the exceptional sound design of Ren Klyce (Fincher's usual partner) as an absurdly hostile place: scattered throughout virtually every scene, sirens blare, neighbors arguing or dogs barking, in addition to the constant fall of rain (which highlights the claustrophobic atmosphere) and thunder. In fact, the sheer lack of silence ends up representing a touch of chaos in the characters' lives: here we can hear water running in the distance; there, the whistle that indicates the reverse of a truck. Meanwhile, the soundtrack composed by Howard Shore hammers the tension through ""themes"" (if they can be called that) that invest in the repetition of bass chords and their crescendo - this when the film employs the soundtrack, which is much rarer over the projection of what we might expect in similar projects (in addition, Shore's choice is also appropriate given his stunning work on The Silence of the Lambs four years earlier).

We also have the almost omnipresence of rain in the sound of the film and it is inevitable to see how this is associated with production design to convert Se7en's world into a pit of sadness and melancholy: in addition to the gray, desaturated palette that runs through the narrative, the designer Arthur Max certainly worked alongside Richard Schuler, responsible for the location research, to make sure that the exteriors would always bring the presence of iron railings and fences that would complement the pattern of the interiors, which would also invest in these elements - and in others similar ones employing vertical lines - to create the impression that those people are trapped in their terrible daily lives (until we get, of course, to the expressive use of car grilles in the final sequence).

None of these elements would be possible, however, without the brilliant script by Andrew Kevin Walker, whose structure is absolutely flawless. Adopting the strategy of building the plot around a double countdown (the seven crimes and the seven days remaining before Somerset retires), Walker punctuates the advance of time by marking each new day on the screen, adding to the tension simply by remembering the spectator that the week is passing. Furthermore, he uses the dialogues intelligently and cost-effectively to mark the hostility of the universe he has created (such as bringing in Somerset explaining that rape victims should shout ""Fire!"" instead of ""Help!"") and in developing his characters, for Mills constantly makes jokes and comments that indicate his immaturity and explosive nature, contrasting it with the cautious and sober way in which his companion expresses himself. What's more: when John Doe first appears on the scene disguised as a photographer, the screenwriter disguises his importance by leading Somerset to explain that journalists pay well for information such as crime scenes - which, in turn, is also relevant when he returns in a later speech by the assassin when he exposes how he discovered Mills' address (""It's disturbing, the ease with which a member of the press can buy information in your district."").

And what about the seemingly casual moment when Walker not only brings up a conversation between the two detectives in which they discuss their worldviews but also warns the viewer about the story's ending (""This isn't going to have a happy ending,"" he says. Somerset)? From a purely structural point of view, it is difficult not to admire the progression of the plot and the understanding we have about the magnitude of the villain's plans, as the first victim is tortured for 12 hours, the second, for a whole weekend and the third... for a year. (Which, by the way, indicates that Doc planned to have them discovered in the opposite order of their deaths.)

Avoiding one of the most common mistakes in movies that revolve around serial killers (giving excessive importance to crimes and ignoring the characters), the script offers actors more than enough material to create complex individuals - and the cast put together by Fincher Doesn't Miss the Opportunity: Newly elevated to the top of Hollywood's most-in-demand actors list after starring opposite Tom Cruise in Interview with the Vampire the year before (when he also starred in his first heart-throb vehicle, Legends of the Passion), Brad Pitt here was still groping in search of a definitive direction for his career. Demonstrating an ambition beyond just being the heartthrob the studios wanted to make him, he turned 1995 into a significant year by starting his partnership with Fincher in this Se7en and accepting a supporting role in The 12 Monkeys to work with Terry Gilliam, where he offered a good performance full of tics and mannerisms.

The dynamic between these two men, of course, becomes one of the main dramatic arcs of the script: initially uncomfortable with each other's style, they are upset with the partnership until - in one of the key scenes of the film - Tracy invites Somerset to dinner, leading to an unexpected moment of lightness when they laugh at the discomfort caused by the subway that shakes the apartment. From there Mills and Somerset build a growing complicity and share difficult memories and opinions about the world, maintaining, even so, the initial postures of a cynical veteran and an optimistic young man. Freeman's character, in particular, soon establishes himself as the spectator's reference in the plot - and when he says he's never seen anything like those crimes, we understand the seriousness of the situation. The detective played by Pitt, even when confronted with the actions of John Doe, insists on believing that there is a purpose behind everything and that he will be able to make a difference - beliefs that the film will soon be responsible for destroying by proving that the his colleague's pessimism was justified (yet, it is shocking to see how even Somerset sinks into John Doe's actions to the point that even his metronome no longer helps him fall asleep).

In addition to this duo, Fincher delivers shocking and bloodthirsty scenes, mounting a growing tension that has long become one of his trademarks. Murder after murder, terror amplified in the face of physical gore, making it impossible not to question the limits and true motives behind the mysterious lunatic. This feature only stands out for the director's full awareness and control, who does not surrender to sheer gratuitous violence (sometimes even sparing the viewer, as in the masterful final scene) and knowing how to take advantage of the greatest asset of these moments: the connection of deaths with the seven deadly sins, it is a precious thing to unveil the way in which the script and direction relate each victim to their respective immorality (such as the defense attorney convicted of his avarice and the drug dealer ""judged"" by laziness, for example).

In addition, the director uses every element at his disposal to bring out the suspense, from the flashlight flashing in Mill's hands as he searches through John Doe's apartment to the energetic montage that, through quick cuts showing detailed plans of the preparations from the police, already makes the spectator anxious when the detectives go to Preguiça's apartment. To top it off, Fincher pays a brief tribute to Blade Runner during the rain chase, also taking the opportunity to portray John Doe as an authentic monster out of the shadows by revealing his reflection in a pool of water and keeping it out of focus when the pipe of his gun seems to stretch toward Mills (in reality, the villain appears as a faceless blur for most of the sequence).

Concluding his strategy of establishing patterns only to break them suddenly, the director still adopts a double break in the last act of the film: besides finally bringing sunlight into the narrative after almost two hours of continuous rain (as if the characters were finally emerging from the charged atmosphere created by John Doe - a false hope), Fincher does something even more revealing by avoiding showing any acts of violence taking place on screen (we only see the results of the assassin's actions) only to make a single exception in the instant of the confrontation between Mills and the villain, shocking the viewer with the unexpected approach.

Many regard Se7en as the definitive David Fincher film to date. It's hard to say something like that, but the film is certainly a complete work to provide the best tension experience possible. Se7en is a miracle of the seventh art and will remain so for decades and decades. David Fincher's work is a detective thriller that certainly enters the group of the best in the genre, showing much of the cruelty that dominates the world in which we live. And so it's hard not to agree with the phrase uttered by one of the characters at the end: ""Ernest Hemingway once wrote 'The world is a good place, and its worth fighting for'."" I agree with the second part.""",10
23 July 2007,Noir horror,"Watched that noir horror movie Se7en on the weekend because I was stuck in a household without many commercial-free alternatives. I normally don't go for grisly films, especially those with Brad Pitt, but since it had such a good write up on rottentomatoes, and I am such a bad movie theater goer these days, I couldn't really pass it up - even if it meant sitting through almost 30 minutes of commercials as is wont on New Zealand TV. I thought it was rather wonderfully done, despite the grisliness. It's not often that you get Dante and Chaucer as major plot references in Hollywood films these days. (If you don't want to watch the film, there is a highly readable film script). You can't but admire the tenacity and the complete obsession of John Doe with his project. I had him down as an Asperger's Syndrome guy right away but I was unsure about his priorities. I mean, we can all empathize with getting a pound of flesh back out of a greedy lawyer, but why did the prostitute have to die? She wasn't the one guilty of lust, her johns are and they got away with only a knife dildo strapped to their groin. And why did he think sloth the worst of all the deadly sins? The victim took a whole year to die a particularly slow and nasty death - much worse than Jesus in The Passion - while the others were dispatched relatively quickly. I still can't take Brad Pitt seriously, but Kevin Spacey has surely deserved his place among the screen's worst baddies.",9
12 March 2021,The second part,"This is the greatest film ever made. The downbeat rain-soaked hell that is the world we live in is represented here expertly. If you haven't seen it. Why the hell not? And if you have, go watch it again. Just remember, This isn't going to have a happy ending.

16 June 2020,"Not Fincher's best work, but quite good","A tight, sophisticated, and often grim thriller- Seven may not always work at times, but it is more impressive than not, and as it goes on, truly proves itself to be a worthy mystery to follow. The film is very well acted, most notably by Kevin Spacey who gives another great performance in the film as John Doe. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt also truly embrace their characters to surreal effects, and you begin to think of them as people rather than simply actors playing a character. The beginning of the film can be a bit cliche, especially in terms of set up in the situations at hand, and the execution for the film can be a bit slow at times- especially towards the beginning. Besides these flaws and the slight predictability of the film, it is very tightly bound, and for the most part, very smart. David Fincher provides excellent work as the director, proving himself to be one of my favorite directors in the film business today. The atmosphere and tone of the film is also very well executed, as well as the cinematography to go with it, and make for its awfully grim, but darkly beautiful nature. In the end, Seven is not a great detective film, nor is it Fincher's best, but it is quite an impressive one at that, and one that shines greater than it may begin to lead on. My Rating: 9/10",9
7 January 2018,Worth its hype and rating,"A great film that was ahead of its time.

6 January 2020,only too boring.,"First of all, as a criminal thing, there was no such thing as a sense of danger such as ""This is serious"" or ""I wish stopping the next crime"". There were no mystery elements, no tricks, no puzzles. Or rather, it was not made that way. So for me who was not interested in Christianity, it could only be boring. It has an incredible reputation in the United States. Probably, the Christian part is great. But it may a huge Christian organization is investing for propaganda. Either way, the Japanese who will be highly regarded in view of this will be children who are likely to be danced by large capitals, people who will turn right if Hollywood turns right, or devout Christians otherwise.

29 September 1998,"Disturbing, dark and brilliant","I remember watching ""Alien 3"" and not being too fond of it. I was impressed with the overall look of the movie and the darkness of it but it just didn't seem to fit in with the previous two movies. I remembered the director's name and found myself looking out for more of his work. I was extremely excited in 1995 when I found out he had directed ""Seven"" since I thought his career had been destroyed by ""Alien 3"". I was clearly wrong. I saw ""Seven"" and walked out of the theater not knowing how I felt about the movie. It stayed with me for a week so I went to see it again. Brilliant! Morgan Freeman is so amazing it's painful. He takes a cop movie cliche (the soon to be retired, embittered cop) and takes it to amazing heights. He allows you to understand his character completely. A beautiful performance.

The movie is incredibly dark not only in tone but physically. Somehow cinematographer Darius Khondji manages to take a desert setting in the middle of the day and make it dark, shadowy and bleak. The dark look of the movie adds to the overall feel of despair.

""Seven"" pretty much gets your attention from the very beginning (introducing Freeman's character and Brad Pitt. . .who is really good) and then throws you a pretty disturbed title sequence which makes you kind of twitchy and puts you in the proper frame of mind.

The movie starts off very graphically with the 'gluttony' killing. If you manage to make it through the scene where the body is discovered (I swear, you can almost smell that apartment!) and the autopsy scene you've already sat through the goriest parts. This doesn't mean that you can relax, though.

A good job by all involved. We can only hope that David Fincher keeps making movies this disturbing and interesting. It seems as if he's definitely on to something.",
25 April 2002,Very little to say,"I've never been at a loss for words in regards to a movie, but Seven always presents such a dilemma. How do you judge something so unique? What can you say that hasn't been said? This film will always be a classic, one worth watching multiple times over. I can never imagine anyone playing the roles of Mills and Somerset other than Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. And the ending! Sometimes, saying very little is all one needs.

31 July 2006,The best murder mystery of the 90's.,"Stars: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, R Lee Ermey and Gwyneth Paltrow.

This is one of the best examples of a good murder mystery. The bad guy is not revealed (though he can be spotted) until the end, but thats not the wist. It plays on what we expect. The film is very dark and it's look and direction is just really great. As for the performances, Kevin Spacey gives the acting job of his career, but because of his other nomination, he was unrecognized for this sick role that he plays. Everyone else does a great job too. The violence in this film is not in a lot, but it's disgusting violence. I highly recommend this to anyone! ***1/2 out of ****. 120 mins. R for strong violence and language.

20 September 2023,"Brilliant, not a formulaic mystery","It's a psychological crime drama set in the 1990s in a large American city. It follows two detectives tracking a serial killer basing his murders on the Seven Deadly Sins.

William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is an older, unmarried African-American homicide detective one week from retirement. He is thoughtful and highly educated, with a clear religious base. His replacement and partner for a week of overlap is David Mills (Brad Pitt). Mills is a young, impulsive high school graduate with limited literary interests. He and his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), have just moved to the city from ""upstate,"" where Mills previously served as a detective. Tracy is less than enthusiastic about the move.

Somerset's and Mills' first case is a bound, obese man found at his kitchen table. Then, a prominent lawyer lawyer dies. At the crime scenes are the words ""gluttony"" and ""greed."" The two detectives realize they're pursuing a serial killer and, at one point, almost catch him. Later, the highly literary John Doe (Kevin Spacey) reveals himself and offers to lead the detectives to two more bodies. There is a horrendous ending.

""Se7en"" sifts through the life views of both Somerset and Mills and their struggle to analyze the killer's motivations. Freeman and Pitt pull wonderful characters from an excellent script. Though there is one memorable chase scene, their dialogue is much more important than the action. Paltrow and Spacey are good in their more limited roles. The cinematography includes much rain and dark, grimy interiors, making this outstanding neo-noir. The ending is twisted and unforgettable, reminding one of ""Silence of the Lambs."" The display of the murders is horrific but not overly gory. ""Se7en"" is not a formulaic mystery.",9
30 September 2021,Classic film,"Well directed and written, shot in a bleak and depressing way where you can feel the hopelessness of living in a crime ridden city. Morgan freeman and Brad Pitt make an excellent detective duo, it's a grim film but it's very clever and thought provoking.

27 February 2012,"""Yeah, a landlord's dream: a paralyzed tenant with no tongue."" ""Yeah, a landlord's dream: a paralyzed tenant with no tongue.""","There is no one who could argue against the fact that if you put Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey together in a film, it is going to be a hit.

I have watched countless hours of murder mysteries in movies and TV and have read innumerable books, and there is no finer murder/serial killer story than this one.

It has every element that one would look for in this type of story and it delivers with a punch to the gut that is visceral and lasting.

This is one of those films that you can watch countless times and never tire of.

Freeman portrays a detective days away from retiring, and Pitt portrays the young detective ready to work and make a difference. They begin investigating odd deaths, that turn out to be murders, carried out in very extreme ways.

8 May 2022,"Remember, it's only a movie","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10

The villain uses deadly seven sins as his motive which was creepy. The ending was shocking and haunting even after repeated viewings

27 February 2021,"Seven has everything a neo-noir needs, David Fincher created a masterpiece that keeps you hooked from start to finish","Seven is a neo-noir/crime thriller directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. This was David Fincher's second film and one of his most impressive films of his incredible filmography. He's a talented director and this is the genre he shines the most in, creating a beautiful looking movie with some truly amazing and fascinating visual storytelling. The overall writing is incredible and deserves its spot on many critics list of best crime films. The film tells the story of David Mills, a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset to track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a motif in his murders.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman plays the main characters, the detectives that we follow throughout the film. Both are well written and brilliantly acted, performances are incredible and among the actors best. The supporting cast has actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, R. Lee Ermey and John C. McGinley. All the characters are written realistic and portrayed the same way, everything feels believeable.

The cinematography is both gorgeous and incredible, the cinematographer knew exactly how a neo-noir should look and the film looks fantastic. Dark and gritty. The production and art design is excellent, everything about the movie is captured so well. The editing got nominated for an Oscar and rightfully so.

When I watched Seven for the first time, I was blown away in how good it was. It was one of the best crime films I had seen and that opinion haven't changed, now on my second viewing and years later I watch it with fresh eyes and notices the clever things that David Fincher placed in, easy to miss on the first watch. Many people believes that this is David Fincher's Magnum Opus, I don't agree with that as I believe Zodiac is superior to this film. But saying that Seven doesn't deserve all its praise, then I would be lying, this film is incredible from start to finish that deserved more awards. I wanted to keep this review spoiler free so I won't go into any specific scenes, there is a lot of iconic and extraordinary scenes through the film. Seven is an unforgettable and mesmerizing experience that keeps to amaze me.",10
11 October 2021,Holy cow...that final act.,"While the much of the first part of the movie is a lot to establish and go through, the final act is what makes it a truly horrifying yet masterful piece that stuns the audience with Kevin Spacey's dialogue, a shocking revelation that ties things together, and an unexpected ending after that to wrap it all up. Sit through the entire movie no matter how much you get bored in a few scenes leading up the climax. You will not regret it. Plus, who doesn't love the main actors??

1 October 2020,"A high-end classic, not quite now","The film is talked about as a high-end classic, but I think the prestige is unnecessarily high.

Sure, many quality actors as well as the director, but that doesn't save this. The end of the film, on the other hand, was special. But that it even sells a movie might cause even a little disappointment.

11 February 2008,Still my favorite movie even after 13 years.,"This movie is such a 'blockbuster' that it is only movie I have ever purchased on DVD. I do not purchase movies because they are a waste of money to me, because I don't like to watch most movies more than once, and because it is so easy to download movies to ones PC from different websites for little money. But I purchased Se7en because this is the one movie I can watch over again. Me purchasing a movie is the highest assessment I can give. So watch Se7en for yourself; it is suspenseful, a thriller, has a great cast of actors who all perform outstandingly, and most important of all an ending no one could have guessed. I just wish that other writers, directors, etc., could produce more movies of this quality and genre.

10 September 2023,"""The World is a Fine Place, and Worth Fighting for. I Agree with the Second Part.""","David Fincher's Seven (also stylised as Se7en) is an exceptionally grim and disturbing detectives-hunt-down-serial-killer film with strong performances, shocking crime scenes, a bleak atmosphere, and one of the greatest finales of cinema history. This is a dark, clever and nail-biting psychological crime-thriller that'll leave you on the edge of you seat from beginning to end, and it's definitely ranked as one of the best serial killer movies of all time.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play two detectives who work together to track down a serial killer whose motivations for his crimes are based on the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride and lust). Seven is a masterful thriller that makes profound use of its perfect script and presents an extremely intelligent execution. In terms of cinematography and the atmosphere, the film takes place in a cold, rainy and undetermined city riddled with violent crime. Every shot is immaculate, bleak and further clarifies that we're stepping through a place that nobody wants to call home.

It's also a significant factor in the film that the bizarre crimes are never shown being performed by this sadistic serial killer, and we follow behind the two protagonists as they investigate the crime scenes under dark lighting and with a haunting background score. David Fincher's film defines as proof that the implications of violence and torture can be as gritty and disturbing off-screen rather than on-screen. These scenes also give massive opportunities to the set designers and make-up artists, departments who each put in the effort and avoid leaving out any single details.

In terms of where the film could use improvement for where certain segments become a bit draggy or continuous, the retirement of Morgan Freeman's character plays quite a big role in the themes mainly during the first act. But this doesn't include all the down-time moments where the characters discuss their own lives and personal problems. Speaking of characters, the performances are out of this world. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman share a brilliant detective chemistry together, Kevin Spacey is phenomenal in his fairly small role of the chilling antagonist, but Gwyneth Paltrow is also fantastic in her hearty supporting role. Overall, Seven is a very grim and bleak movie, one of the best of all time that you should definitely see.

Still its one of the most decent thriller I have ever seen. Morgan freeman is incredible as ever. Brad Pitt is always a treat to watch and yet again he showed why he is the top actor of Hollywood. Gwyneth Paltrow didn't have much scoop but still she leaves strong impact Kevin Spacey is good. Overall nice thriller which I saw too late and I already could guess whats going to happen next but still David Fincher proved that he has his own vision and no one can mess with that. Bravo.

2 July 2000,The preeminent serial killer movie,"We plummet the depths of depravity here. Arrogance never got such a cinematic comeuppance (not to mention gluttony, pride, greed and the rest of the seven deadly sins), nor was innocence ever made such an alien as in this masterpiece of monstrous intent. Morgan Freeman stars as William Somerset, a wise and modest big city homicide detective ready to retire who finds himself partnered with David Mills, an arrogant young detective effortlessly depicted by Brad Pitt. As they try to find the killer there develops between them a nice chemistry that helps to make this an engrossing movie. Kevin Spacey arrives after a bit as 'John Doe,' a 20th century version of a medieval scribe obsessed with sin morphed into a monster from hell. He sees himself as the personal judge, executioner and torturer extraordinaire of a vengeful god gone amuck.

Momma, lock the doors and bar the windows. Don't let this video into your home. You'll watch it, every last minute, and your kids will watch it, several times, their eyes between their fingers, and the end result will be a cynicism about humanity so deep that it'll take the blood of the lamb to wash it clean.

Well, that, or the realization that this is just Hollywood up to its old tricks. After all it's only a movie-or is there something more to this extraordinary commercialization of evil? One of the penetrating things about Seven is the implication that, through the Christian concept of sin and by our very nature, we ourselves create the serial killer and give him a justification to turn upon us and do his wretched deeds. The ending slyly suggests the triumph of evil; and indeed this cagey movie would be depressing beyond redemption were it not for the three things: One, the modest wisdom projected by Morgan Freeman; two, the essential innocence of Brad Pitt's character; and three, the fact that the horrible deeds are the work of only one man. Whether he is just an insane 'nut-bag' as Pitt's character exclaims, or part of our nature as the film implies, is an interesting question.

Serial killer film makers of the future will try to top this one, but I doubt if it will happen any time soon. This is already a classic. Incidentally, I do wonder about these guys (Walker and Fincher) who lie awake nights dreaming up this stuff. I hope they're only doing it for the money.

By the way, perfect font for the credits.

22 June 2009,A clever and stylish thriller,"David Fincher's ""Seven"" has become something of a modern classic since its release nearly 15 years ago. The film focuses on a pair of detectives tracking a serial killer who has drawn his inspiration from the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride & lust.

The cast is a pretty good one. Morgan Freeman is excellent in the role of a burnt-out cop on his way out the door as soon as he trains in his replacement (Brad Pitt). Pitt does a good job as a brash young detective itching for a shot at a big-time case. Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pitt's wife, delivers a solid performance and the rest of the cast is about average. It should also be noted that the (Oscar-winning) actor who plays the killer isn't listed in the opening credits, so that's a bit of a surprise for the audience.

The screenplay is quite clever but that cleverness almost seems at odds with the film's gritty realism. The killer's intricate plans are the sort of thing that you only encounter in the movies. The characters are somewhat clichéd and Freeman is handed a few well-worn lines that I think only he could have pulled off. Given this shortcoming, the ending succeeds more through shock value than in creating a response based on our attachment to the characters.

Fincher's direction is well-handled throughout and merges with the cinematography and editing to create a unique, atmospheric look. While there may be a bit of an emphasis on style over substance the director manages to keep from going overboard. The soundtrack also contributes greatly to the atmosphere, mixing contemporary music and an effective score from Howard Shore.

""Seven"" is indeed a quality thriller but I would hesitate to rank it alongside the likes of ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Thus, I think that the current IMDb ranking (#32) is unreasonably high but I do recommend the film.",8

This movie has an eeiry mystery to it that only David Fincher can pull off. It's dark, cold and atmospheric. You are consistently waiting for what comes next, and you know it's going to be good.

The final scene is a lesson for mankind, or however you take it. The final scenes are among the greatest in a horror/thriller genre.

19 October 2020,Full of thriller's atmosphere,"With a dark, menacing score that perniciously pulses from start to finish, an airtight ensemble cast that interacts with almost distressingly subtle nuance, and all the harsh lighting and sinister cinematography that has come to define the contemporary film noir, Se7en is absolutely one of the best crime thrillers ever created. Fincher's first true masterpiece, the story follows two thoroughly antagonistic New York detectives through a mélange of religion, literature, psychosis, and pure horror.

25 June 2002,I Didn't Rate This Film Too Much,"Se7en isn't that bad of a film-I just think that sometimes with movies they can be hyped too much so that when you actually watch the finished product you can be quite disappointed.

The main stars-Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt-certainly played intriguing characters but the film was just too heavy for me throughout. I do like this type of genre but the film seemed to move too slow for me and I wasn't that keen on the ending.

With films like this you either love them or hate them. A lot of people seemed to like this film and in the interests of objectivity, I did watch it twice but on both occasions I felt unfulfilled.

The producers deserve some credit for the effort they put into the movie-I certainly seem to be in the minority with regards to my opinion of this film. Most people seemed to love it.

28 August 2007,Excellent craft work but not art,"Watching how the two detectives (a beginner and an experienced one) are pursuing a very intelligent serial killer is extremely well played and directed. Alone their interactions during the investigation is worth seeing the movie. The whole film is very much a male-type story except the character of the wife of the young detective. The appearance of the feminine character gives a human flavor to the work of the detectives transforming their male-like competition into elderly-young cooperation. Why I rate only 3 out of 10? Because the authors do not seem to understand the fundamental concept of the film, the 7 cardinal sins. The 7 cardinal sins are not actually sins themselves but are the source of other sins. Example: a married man seeing a pretty woman can feel desire to have her, but this is because men are biologically designed like this. If he acts to have the woman despite being married then he commits sins, but this sin is called adultery. So, in fact, there is one voluntary sinner in the film: the serial killer. The others - as the senior detective explains - just fail to work towards a balanced life, towards being able to love. The conclusion, that ""life is ugly but let's work to make it better"" is therefore flawed and makes the film a technically excellent work without the spirit that distinguishes craft work from true art.",3
15 October 2011,Prepare to pay for your sins!,"David Fincher's bleak thriller, about a serial killer that chooses his victims in the order of the seven deadly sins: gluttony, envy, lust, pride, sloth, greed and wrath.

Grossing $327 million at the box office internationally, Seven was a commercial success. The filming took place in Los Angeles, California.

Plot: In an unidentified city of near-constant rain and urban decay, the soon-to-be retiring Detective William R. Somerset (Freeman) is partnered with short-tempered Detective David Mills (Pitt) who recently transferred to the department.

The detectives investigate a series of murders relating to the seven deadly sins, such as an obese man who was forced to feed himself to death, representing ""Gluttony"". They find clues at each crime scene related to other deaths, and believe they are chasing a serial killer. A set of fingerprints found at the scene of the ""Greed"" murder — the fatal bloodletting of a rich attorney — leads them to an apartment where they find an emaciated man strapped to a bed. Though he initially appears to be dead, it soon is discovered that the man, a drug dealer and sexual deviant before his captivity, has been kept alive and entirely immobile by the killer for exactly one year to the day. This victim, who dies soon after being found, represents ""Sloth."" Though unable to learn anything from the insentient victim, the detectives agree that the killer has planned these crimes for more than a year.

Somerset is eventually invited to meet Mills' wife, Tracy (Paltrow), who is unhappy with Mills' recent move to the city. Somerset becomes Tracy's confidant, and she meets with him after the first few murders. Upon learning that she is pregnant but has not told her husband, Somerset confides in her his fear that the city is no place to start a family, and reveals that he had ended a relationship years earlier after pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Somerset advises her to not tell Mills if she plans to have an abortion; otherwise, if she decides to keep the child, ""spoil that kid every chance you get"".

Using illegally obtained library records, Somerset and Mills track down a man they dub 'John Doe' (Spacey), who has frequently checked out books related to the deadly sins. When Doe finds the detectives approaching his apartment, he opens fire on them and flees, chased by Mills. Eventually, Doe gains the upper hand and holds Mills at gunpoint, but then abruptly leaves. Investigation of Doe's apartment finds handwritten volumes of his irrational judgments and clues leading to another potential victim, but no fingerprints. They arrive too late to find their ""Lust"" victim, a prostitute killed by a man wearing a bladed S&M device, forced by Doe to simultaneously rape and kill her. Some time later, they investigate the death of a young model whose face had been mutilated. Having chosen to kill herself rather than live with a disfigured face, she is the victim of ""Pride"".

As they return to the police station, Doe unexpectedly appears to them and offers himself for arrest, with the blood of the model and an unidentified victim on his hands. They find out that he has been cutting the skin off his fingers to avoid leaving fingerprints. Through his lawyer, Doe claims he will lead the two detectives to the last two bodies and confess to the crimes, or otherwise will plead insanity. Though Somerset is worried, Mills agrees to the demand. Doe directs the two detectives to a remote desert area far from the city; along the way, he claims that God told him to punish the wicked and reveal the world for the awful place that it is. He also makes cryptic comments toward Mills.

After arriving at the location, a delivery van approaches; Somerset intercepts the driver, leaving Mills and Doe alone. The driver hands over a package he was instructed to deliver at precisely this time and location. While Mills holds Doe at gunpoint, Doe mentions how much he admires him, but does not say why. Somerset opens the package and recoils in horror at the sight of the contents. He races back to warn Mills not to listen to Doe, but the killer reveals that the box contains Tracy's head. Revealing that he purchased information about Mills by posing as a tabloid reporter, Doe claims to represent the sin of ""Envy""; he was jealous of Mills' normal life, and killed Tracy after failing to ""play husband"" with her. He then taunts the distraught Mills with the knowledge that Tracy was pregnant. Somerset is unable to contain Mills as he unloads his gun into Doe, becoming the embodiment of ""Wrath"". After a catatonic Mills is taken away, Somerset is asked where he will be; he replies, ""around"".

The film ends with the sun setting over the desert, with Somerset quoting Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls: ""'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.""

Planned alternate endings for the film: [1] In which Mills is killed by Doe, then Somerset kills Doe. [2] In which Somerset kills Doe in order for Doe's planned way to die at the hands of Mills foiled. Also Somerset states he is doing this so that Mills would replace him at his job.

Verdict: among the best serial killer films ever made. BUY IT!

17 August 2018,A Brutal Albeit Endlessly Intriguing Crime Thriller,"Although Alien 3 was filmmaker David Fincher's directorial debut, I think he'd prefer to call this film his real debut any day of the week. Released in 1995, Seven (or Se7en) went on to gain critical acclaim, huge box-office revenue, and helped kickstart new beginnings for the director. To this very day, it remains by many as a highly graphic and disturbing neo-noir flick with a highly engaging premise and finale. After seeing the film in its entirety myself, I could not agree more.

The film tells the story of two New York detectives named William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) who track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins in his murders. What really holds the movie together are the two leads, as Pitt and Freeman display excellent chemistry with each other. Both of their characters have their own desires in life, with Somerset on the brink of retirement and Mills just starting at his position. Their performances are so sharp and realistic that it's hard to see the actors rather than the actual characters. Considering how disgusting their murder case is, it's only fitting that they do the necessary reacting and analyzing.

In addition to strong leads, some of the supporting cast are quite memorable in their own regard. Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), faces certain struggles upon moving to a new city and certain complications about her personal life. Whenever she's with Somerset, you can just feel her devastation, making her arguably the most sympathetic character in the whole feature. However, the serial killer himself, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), is one who could really send shivers down anyone's spine. Alongside all of his murders being horrific yet well thought out, he's actually smarter than one might assume, and he practically wrote the third act he's so clever albeit evil (no spoilers).

I'm not too familiar with David Fincher's directing style, but this film really displays New York in a graphic setting. Even when it's a calm rainy day or even sunny, there's always a sense of danger lurking about. The editing is also very well paced, especially during a particularly suspenseful chase scene of Mills and John Doe through an apartment complex which must've went through lots of trial and error to get right. The grim tone helps give the viewers a glimpse of the horrors in the world, so when we know more about John Doe, you'd only wish you could never meet someone like that again.

Isn't it great how a filmmaker's career can really get off the ground when they make an original film of their liking as opposed to some lame Hollywoodized sequel? After 23 years, Seven stills holds up as a modern classic that dares to tackle life's harsh realities, the depiction of two detectives investigation solving a horrific case, and the darkest realms that the human soul offers. If you're in to very gothic, psychological thrillers that talk about themes like the aforementioned, definitely give this a watch when you can. Fincher has since gone on to make more worthwhile films that still inspire many to this day, so it looks like I've got quite a gold mine ahead of me.",9
11 July 2010,The Most Intelligent and Horrific Serial Killer Film Since Silence of the Lambs,"What does Dante's ""Divine Comedy"", Christopher Marlowe's ""The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus"", John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", and the film ""Seven"" have in common? They all reference the ""Seven Deadly Sins"". The Seven Deadly Sins, also known as the Capital Vices or Cardinal Sins, is a classification of vices propagated by the early Christian Church as being the most objectionable and immoral. They fit within St Augustine's rhetoric in terms of fallen humanity's tendency to sin. The list consists of gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. ""Seven"" incorporates the literary references of the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" into a compelling but shocking serial killer story.

Brad Pit, in one of his best performances, plays a rookie detective, David Mills, teamed with veteran and soon-to-be-retiring Detective William Somerset, played by Morgan Freeman in one of the best roles of his unequaled career. They are investigating a series of ghastly homicides in an American urban center that seems a helluva lot like Chicago. The veteran detective has seen almost everything an urban cop can endure during an average career before the beginning of the story. However, as events transpire, they reveal things even he, after decades on the force, hasn't experienced. The rookie has no idea what's in store for him, and by movie's end he will have sustained the most horrific experience of a police detective coming-of-age ever shot on film. We get the sense all rookie detectives go through a kind of ""baptism of fire"" but nothing which would prepare a newbie to the force something as simultaneously horrific and devastating as that presented in ""Seven"".

Unlike the usual street crime, these murders have a disturbing combination of dreadful horror coupled with high literary intelligence. The killer incorporates religious and literary symbolism into his acts of unspeakable violence and murder. Each act and victim reference a different ""Deadly Sin"". The killer may be mad but he is an highly intelligent madman, who could probably quote Dante while loading a Magnum 44. The well-known actor who plays the killer/religious fanatic who reveals himself toward the end is perfect casting.

Hollywood rarely produces films with such a combination of horror and high intelligence. The closest comparable film is ""Silence of the Lambs"" whose character Hannibal Lecter is strikingly similar to the fiend in this film, although their motivations are entirely different. Both of these characters, the killer of ""Seven"" and Hannibal Lecter, are homicidal sociopaths of uncommon literary knowledge, which communicate disturbing overtones of higher purpose. They are the type who would probably view the act of crucifixion as an artistic statement.

This is an incredible film both in its dreadfulness and its cerebral content, but definitely not for the feint of heart or the squeamish. As for myself, this is probably the limit in terms of the disturbing meter--worse than this would be out of bounds. Despite the gruesome subject matter, this film has enough compelling elements, from the literary references to the relationship between Pitt and Freeman, that it does work as a masterpiece of the serial killer genre. And the ending is one of the most compelling and original conclusions I have ever witnessed in this type of film, but don't expect the main characters to be celebrating with beers at the end. There are very subtle hints during the film which point to how the movie's ending will unfold, but like most movie-goers during my initial viewing, the ending erupts like a dragon flying straight out of Hell.",10
28 August 2020,Preachy movie,"I never thought this would be as dark as my instincts in capturing the essence of the story of this thriller movie. I think there must've been some better narrative or ending to complete this story perfectly. I just don't get how this movie ends like the way it is. I'm not disappointed, all I can say is this movie just didn't satisfy me enough.

14 May 2006,Better than today's thriller movies.,"One of the few thriller movies I liked so far next to The Shining and Hitchcock's movies.

Seven is about Brad Pitt playing a young detective and Morgan Freeman playing a much older detective. They're both involved in a twisted murder case that is linked to the seven deadly sins.

Envy, Sloth, Lust, Gluttney, Wrath, Greed and Pride.

The victims of these murders are linked to those sins.

The murder behind these killings is a sick and obsess Catholic who's been planing to do this for quite sometime.

Our 2 detectives must find the killer and who'll end up being the last few victims of this scheme.

I rarely make good reviews for thriller movies cause the ones today are full of sh*t. I think this movie is way better than the Ring or Saw movies. Not obsess with Brad Pitt but Morgan Freeman was great with his role.

I think this movie is worth buying if you like mystery/thriller/murder movies. This is a rare treat for a good thriller movie.",7
15 January 2011,"Dark, disturbing and fabulous","In a dark, gloomy city where the rain never stops and the signs of urban decay are everywhere you look two detectives hunt down a serial killer. The first detective is William Somerset, about to retire and desperately looking forward to a quiet life in the country away from all the urban misery. The second is young hotshot David Mills. He is to be Somerset's replacement and he can't wait to get started. He actually asked for this assignment. He relishes the opportunity to deal with the worst of the worst in this hellish city. Of course he has no idea what he's in for. Somerset knows. Or at least he thinks he does. Because not even wise, old Somerset could possibly anticipate the events which are about to unfold. These two detectives, one on the way in and one on the way out, will be forced into a reluctant partnership as they work one chilling case. The dead bodies begin to pile up and Somerset and Mills get more than they ever could have bargained for. And quite possibly more than they can bear.

Somerset and Mills find themselves investigating a bizarre and horrifying series of murders. By the time the second body turns up it is clear that an obviously deranged, though also obviously intelligent, killer is planning on murdering one victim to represent each of the seven deadly sins. A morbidly obese man is forced to eat himself to death. Gluttony. A rich attorney is forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh. Greed. And so on. The killings are gruesome. The killer, dubbed John Doe, is a man clearly capable of unimaginably monstrous things. And somehow Somerset and Mills have to stop him before he completes his set. Before he completes his deranged sermon to the world. It all makes for one morbidly fascinating movie. And one with a unique twist. Serial killer movies generally go one of two ways. Either they show you the killer all the way through as you watch him do his bloody work. Or they keep the killer invisible and focus solely on those pursuing him. This movie leads you in one direction and then whips you around and turns everything on its head. Rather brilliant stuff.

As we watch Somerset and Mills do the old cop/young cop routine we've seen in so many other movies the contrasts between the two are exceedingly obvious. These are two very different men, attacking the John Doe case from two very different perspectives. Somerset is calm, collected, a thinking man. And Morgan Freeman, with his quiet dignity, portrays this perfectly. Mills is a man more about action than thought. He's brash, emotional and a little immature. You get the sense early on that this is a man who may not be ready for what he is going to have to face. In playing this part Brad Pitt has his ups and downs. It's not a bad performance by any means but there are moments where the character's words and actions don't really ring true. Mills comes off as being a little too insecure, and at times downright childish. The contrast between Mills and Somerset is supposed to be obvious, and supposed to be a major theme of the film. But at times the contrast is just a little too stark to be believable. Even in the incredibly tense, drama-packed finale Pitt's Mills comes across as much too whiny and immature. His reactions to what he is confronted with just don't seem to fit. Perhaps Pitt went just a touch too far in displaying all of the insecurities and personality quirks which make up Detective Mills. But it's nothing bad enough to really detract from the overall movie-watching experience. Director David Fincher crafted something rather special here. So much more than just another serial killer movie. It's smart, it's riveting, and in the end it's quite jaw-dropping. Maybe Pitt is just adequate. But Freeman is brilliant. And one other performer is even better than that. But that final, perfectly fitted piece to this puzzle you have to discover for yourself.",8
9 April 2019,"Still dark and shocking, and inviting us to choose between despair and hope.","Jaws - a film that is often credited with launching what we now know as the summer blockbuster phenomenon - is justly famous for many things. It's a masterpiece of slowly building fear, in part because the shark itself is unseen by the viewer for a long, long time. David Fincher's 1994 serial killer thriller takes inspiration from Spielberg's game-changer in that respect; we don't see the face of the killer until 30 minutes before the film's end, at a moment of revelation of his own choosing. Neither do we see the murders take place; in the film's memorable rain-sodden foot chase we only see his back; his face remains out of focus even when he's pointing a gun in Brad Pitt's face, deciding his fate. David Fincher knows what most good horror films and thrillers have made apparent over the years: the unseen is more threatening and frightening than the known.

Rewatching this film for the first time in years in 2019, I'm struck especially by how normal the abnormal events it portrays are made to seem. A serial killer who bases his work on the seven deadly sins of Christian tradition is nothing especially original; religious references are a familiar serial killer trope. Fincher places this killing spree in the hands of an apparently ordinary figure - one who goes by the name of John Doe (the name given by American police to an unidentified deceased male). As John Doe himself says, as the film's unforgettable ending hoves into view: ""I'm not special; I've never been exceptional ... it's more comfortable for you to label me insane"".

It's dangerous to quote the words of a killer as if they contain some kind of truthfulness, but this is the heart of the film: that evil is ubiquitous; it's in all of us. In each of the serial killer's victims, in the police chasing him, in the killer himself. In an age where the mass shootings that still stalk America are so routinely passed off as committed by someone with 'mental health problems', personal responsibility is avoided. The truth is we're all to blame; Se7en holds a mirror up to us, and it's not a pleasant sight. To summarise what John Doe says near the conclusion, we tolerate sin in ourselves and others because it's normal. It's this, it seems, that as the credits roll and those involved are left to live with the terrible consequences of their actions, that drives Morgan Freeman to utter the film's final words in voice over: ""Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part."" It's a brutal way to leave the story, and one which the makers of the film fought the studio to keep in, and no less powerful for it; though now, having seen many more films than I had on seeing Se7en in the cinema, it seemed a tad too much of tell as opposed to show.

This seems bleak - and it is, if we conclude that the fight of which Hemingway is speaking is fruitless. For those who believe following Jesus is worthwhile and eternally meaningful, it's a profoundly hopeful place to be; the world may not be as fine a place, as was intended; but there is a better way; and that better way will, eventually, be seen by all.

It is a battle, though, and in the meantime many suffer. As long as any of us - like John Doe in this film - take matters in to our hands, take the judging as something for us to execute, then there will be casualties. Not least ourselves, but also those unfortunate enough to be in our orbit.

All of which leads us to the Kevin Spacey question. With the revelations about his alleged sexual harassments and assaults, the question remains: should we watch his films? I have no easy answer here. I have been bullied to the point of suicide by someone who used to speak on big conference stages; I know how painful it was to see that person lauded by thousands when I knew different; I have forgiven the person, but still my stomach lurches with nausea and I'm wracked with anxiety if I see his name alluded to in a social media feed. I was sexually and physically abused as an adult by an adult; if I were to see her in a public role, it would be very hard to take. So I argue that Spacey's victims must be given much consideration here; I would want the same for myself. With that in mind, I rewatched Se7en for the first time since these allegations came out. As I reflected on the film's themes of the ubiquity of evil I found myself asking uncomfortable questions. If Spacey's past work is not to be considered any more; if my bully's speaking is no longer to be listened to; if my abuser is never to have a relationship ... then what of me? I have not done any of these things - but if I believe sin and evil are ubiquitous (and I do), then that means I'm as guilty of sin as anyone else. I hope I own my sins and seek forgiveness, in large part through the regular discipline of confession; but I also know I am prone to err. Let he who is without sin ...

I do not have an answer, at least not yet. Certainly it seems to me that Spacey, and those like him, should not be widely spoken of or employed in the public eye - at the very least until fault has been admitted, responsibility taken and justice served. Fittingly for this film, for now I remain with this tension unresolved.

What remains true is that it's still a beautifully constructed, chilling and gripping thriller that haunts and shocks even after all these years; even when I know the point to which the story is heading. More culturally significant films still lay ahead of Fincher, not least Fight Club; many would cite Zodiac (2006) as his best film; The Social Network (2010) tells at least part of the story of one of the era's dominant themes. Of course, we don't know what more is to come from him. Se7en sets the template for his best work: morally complex, darkly thrilling, and directed with a flair that fits the story and the theme. If not quite as dynamic as I remember, it's still a film to be reckoned with, that ultimately asks us to choose between despair and hope.",8
11 January 2011,Fincher;s Finest work.,"I remember wanting to watch Copycat starring Sigourney Weaver and seeing this as a trailer before and thinking it looked good. I left Copycat thinking it was OK and then saw this a month later. I came out and thought wow what a movie. I have seen it numerous times since and it is such a great film on many levels. Brad Pitt's descent in to despair, Morgan Freeman seeking solace from a nameless city he hates to live in, and a simply ingenious set of murders by a crusading yet mad serial killer played sublimely by Spacey. I love the fact that even the dialogue is not clear along with the story so it is impossible to know what is to happen next. In fact over the next couple of days, I think I will watch it again. Brad's best film.

31 January 2021,The seven capital crimes,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",8
4 February 2023,"the detective thriller than changed detective movies forever, for the better","Being that i am a fan of dark , supernatural and detective stuff, after watching this i could say we need to thank everyone involved in this movie, because this movie paved the way for the bone collector, the fallen, the batman, solace, even spectre and deja vu have some influence...and alot more of thrillers that already liked that have this gritty, dark style.

Everybody already has said alot about this movie. The key to me is the atmosphere and the direction.between the eerie feel in every scene, the way the actors believe their characters and the photography, the plot that both detectives(the young that is unexperienced and gets angry fast, and the old that is smart and already is looking for clues)search for a bad that feels more supernatural than real horror movies. David fincher showed here that is better when the horror and supernatural stuff is the atmosphere in every scene, we dont need monsters or whatever, the movie already make you feel like this is something coming from alan poe or lovecraft.even true detective first season take a lesson from this movie.so people who already know my taste, watch it, all the times you need to get it. And get ready to see more of this stuff.

My suggestion for matt reeves sequel to batman is to take clues from this movie and solace, and make a batman against supernatural.

If 007 never goes supernatural(spectre at least tried in atmosphere and style) let batman do it. Already batman is the darkness,so he fighting againt something beyond his believe will be great, even if is hard to watch or scary.

And alot of fans of this genre(supernatural, dark thrillers) will be happy to see something like that.

And no spoilers, watch the movie, if you dare. Solace is even darker and i have watched that movie alot of times, and spectre feel eerie since the opening, wish they someday do something even more dark.",10
7 February 2007,Seven is decent,"This film was OK. It was very dark and not very watchable at times. It definitely ranks up there with other films of it's genre, but you wonder why Hollywood keeps churning out these dark, morose films without any to cheer about.

You know Morgan never fails to deliver and Pitt was also excellent. Very suspenseful. Kept me on the edge of my seat and has a lot of those type of scenes that make you jump out of your seat and scared the heck out of you. This movie is non stop thrills and chills not a great date movie though, tends to scare to point where your shaking at the end of the movie.

I'm not a fan of Fincher films except for 'The Game'. I'm not into worshipping serial killers because guess what: it breeds more serial killers.

8 May 2000,A number worth thinking about....,"A movie as dark, disturbing and heavily wrought with despair as ""Se7en"" can hardly be called entertainment. This is a motion-picture statement. And not an encouraging one. But a statement all the same.

Not to say that it's a bad movie. Quite the opposite.

In a tale where a retiring police detective (Freeman) takes one last case along with his replacement (Pitt), only to find that their investigation leads them down through a very First Testament eye-for-an-eye lesson in the seven deadly sins, you cannot expect a merry romp down the yellow brick road.

As the victims have all been felled by such vices as gluttony, vanity, sloth, sex and such, Freeman and Pitt slowly realize that they are dealing not only with a sicko but one who means to follow his lesson on to the bitter end.

And that's it. I won't tell another bit of the plot; this is the kind of movie that has to be witnessed first-hand. I'll be the first to admit that it's definitely not a movie for anybody. Certainly most people will be turned off almost immediately by the gore and downbeat intensity of the whole situation. As Freeman so lucidly observes, ""This isn't going to have a happy ending."" - well, how could it?

Freeman is, of course, a sound center to the film and without him as a grounding wire, the whole film would have suffered through its grunge and blood and rainy days and nights. Much has been said of Pitt's ineffectual stance in his role, but I think that's the whole point: he's the common man who just sees this killer as another wacko to lock up. His eventual transformation is almost un-noticeable as he turns from a deadened, I've-seen-it-all type into someone who can't quite believe that such debased evil actually exists until.. well, that would be telling; suffice it to say that it's gradual and sudden all at once - and makes perfect sense, in context.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife about as well as can be expected under the circumstances. R. Lee Ermey plays a more sedate version of the drill sergeant he made so vivid in ""Full Metal Jacket"". And as for John Doe... it's a credit to his performance that he makes himself so eerily believable as someone who believes this is the only way to make people listen to what he has to say. And, in some sick way, he may be right.

But the people aren't the stars here, and neither is Fincher's dark, foreboding direction - it's the story and where it leads to, it's the talks you'll have afterwards about what happens at the end, it's about sin and death and what really has to be done to make some people aware of what sin is around them and how dead we've all become towards it. Maybe ""Se7en"" is more about how we react to the eventual lesson taught and how it's presented than the actors, the gore and the literary quotes.

If you can stomach the gore and your heart can take some pretty wrenching scenes, this may be a movie for you to watch, think about and, possibly, learn from. I watched it and, myself, learned a pretty important lesson. Of course, every movie teaches its own different lesson to different people. See ""Se7en"" yourself and draw your own conclusion.

Eight stars for ""Se7en"". Powerful: yes. Disturbing: definitely. Unforgettable: absolutely.",8
8 January 2000,Superb Thriller with a brilliant ending,"Se7en , in my opinion is one of the best cop movies ever made if not THE best. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman try to track down a vicious serial killer who murders using the seven deadly sins. A great storyline and fantastic ending( very un Hollywood!). There has only been one movie that has had a better ending than this and that is Monty Pythons Life of Brian. If you havent seen Se7en before you Must watch it! 10 out of 10

27 August 2000,7 deadly sins,"This is one of the best thrillers I've seen and I've seen quite a few. You might say I'm an actual serial killer freak. This one sure is one of the best, it ranks right up there with other thrillers like Scream, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Blair Witch Project, Copycat, Arlington Road and Fight Club (if you miss Silence of the Lambs, well I can't remember that film so good so I just left it out). The only film that is actually relevant here, because of the serial killer content is of course Copycat. I wouldn't say these two films are even (considering quality), hell no Se7en is better, but hey I must mention Copycat here, because that film featuring Sigourney Weaver was released in 1995 also and I feel it has been neglected or maybe just overlooked by some due to the big success Se7en was. If you like Se7en you'll like Copycat, because it is about a killer, who well copy's famous serial killers.

Now finally on to the film in question. I feel like there is nothing much to be said about this film that already someone said or has written on this page. Still I must comment on it. For one thing I must do so, because this film features some of the best actors there are today and it also is original. First the actors, we have of course heart throb Brad Pitt as you might call him, well I call him one of the best actors of our time. He has done some really good films and by that I don't mean his older ones like Legends of the Fall or A River runs through it, no I mean this one, Fight Club (very good, very underrated) and maybe Thelma & Louise. In this film he delivers a good performance nothing too fancy but good. Especially in the ending I must say, for that part was his hardest. Good acting but not Oscar stuff. Then of course there is Morgan Freeman (see The Shawshank Redemption, Kiss the Girls and Outbreak), who is good too, as most of the time, when there is a job to be done he does it. And now for the best one yet, Kevin Spacey (whose best films are Outbreak, The Usual Suspects, A Time to Kill, The Negotiator, American Beauty and maybe The Ref), who is not that much on  screen but if he is, damn. What a great actor. You might not think this when watching the film the first time except maybe at the very end. But if you watch the film a second time and have remembered the ending (you are probably asking yourselves if can you forget it, well I've done so once but now I've seen it three times and I'll never forget I think) you have to listen closely to the conversation in the car. The way Spacey talks and what he says, it makes so much more sense' when you know the ending. He is just so confident and already teasing men who don't think he is superior when he knows he is, for he has all the aces right up his sleeve. This brings me right up to the originality of this film actually. It is not only that the films story is very original, because never have I seen somebody kill people in connection with the 7 deadly sins. It is also original in the way they are carried out and that is what makes this film really special. The killings are not only brutal, but they are well prepared, so we are dealing with a genius of a madman, something that becomes very clear at the end and not until then, maybe. I think that you actually have to like this movie you must like it unless maybe it is too gory for you. If it isn't you'll like it, trust me.

13 January 2021,Still packs a punch!,"I don't think I've seen this more than twice. Once when it was released and once when I bought the DVD, back when I bought DVDs. It's been over 20 years. Se7en was always great, right from the get go. Watching it now, it instantly feels like a classic. Now time will do that, but only if it's truly worthy. Freeman is at the top of his game. Pitt rides his coattails admirably. Even Paltrow can't undo it or the oh so 90s industrial grunge titles with NIN & Bowie. Spacey too absolutely nails the deranged creep role... not that that's surprising now I guess. Fincher wastes no time in getting to it. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are homicide cops in the rainiest town in America. Somerset is the soon to retire meticulous expert. Mills, the young buck full of energy and enthusiasm. This film works, as much for the string of crimes they're about to get embroiled in as for their relationship with one another. Details are fun, gripping, but it's people, characters that make stories and films tick. Don't get me wrong though. Details are important here. We're invited to the investigation alongside S&M and the joy in Se7en, if that's the right word, is the slow methodical release of those details, to the cops and to us. I suppose what makes Se7en so widely loved though is it's easy. Somerset holds our hand through it all. He's the brain cracking the leads, reading the books on the seven deadly sins. Despite his weariness, this invigorates him and us. There's an understood structure here. We know there'll be seven murders. We know we won't be done until that happens. Even with a flurry of hope right before Sloth, our detective buddies are casting doubt. They've studied this guy, they know they're being lead, as we are, step by step, murder by murder. Now I don't usually like gore and make no mistake Se7en has it in spades. It's one grotesque scene after another. It works because of the strength of the narrative, but damn I struggle with Sloth. Probably because he's still alive. I remember watching that DVD commentary about the casting of Michael Reid MacKay as the body for Sloth, chosen in part because he was skinny. When it came to filming though, he turned up having lost even more weight feeling it would be more convincing. That somehow makes it feel even more terrifying. Sloth is of course our first glimpse of the killer. A little tease that alludes the first time viewer. Although not for long, Se7en doesn't really make you work that hard. It's the perfect creepy crime thriller, but I think I'd forgotten how brutal it is. Sloth, Lust, all I can say is thank goodness for Somerset and Mills' theological conversations, they're the respite from this dark, cold and wet, dirty dangerous world. The pacing is perfect, the tone rides the slick production with the gritty visuals well. Pitt is a little cartoony, but 25 years on it still packs a punch... and it's got a killer finale.",10
8 February 2023,Great Movie with a predictable ending,"Let's get the good out of the way. This was a very artistic movie with some excellent ambience (I loved the rain). The murders were gruesome and the storyline was engaging. Morgan Freeman was excellent as always and Brad Pitt had some great moments. However, Kevin Spacey really stole the show for me. It's a great movie and I think it's definitely worth the watch.

Now on to the bad. As Se7en is a bit of a genre-defining film, it's hard to watch for the first time today without feeling like the plot is dull. It definitely has its moments, especially when the sloth victim, but one of the most pivotal moments fell completely flat to me. I was able to predict the ending as soon as I knew the killer was going through the seven deadly sins, so as the tension rose and the film built up to its climax, I was waiting for something to throw me off guard. However, everything happened just as I expected it. Apparently, this is not a common experience with this movie, but it was my experience, so it really docked the movie from a solid 9 inching towards a 10 to an 8 sinking towards a 7.",8
14 March 2004,No cop out here,"You frequently walk out of movies feeling somewhat cheated by the production companies desire to have a feel good conclusion. How many movies are quite entertaining until a knee jerk conclusion spoils the rest of the movie. Se7en doesn't suffer this conclusion and thank god Fincher refused to change the ending of the movie.

Somerset (Freeman) is on his final week of police duty when paired with Mills (Pitt). They are allocated to a case that eventually turns out to be John Doe (Spacey) creating his own masterpiece of seven deadly sins. The characters area all given plenty of space to develop during the movie. The contrast between Mills and Somerset at either ends of their police careers is particularly interesting. 9/10

31 December 2018,An engaging crime thriller,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",8
12 January 2009,The Little Film Noir That Couldn't,"I had to give it 5 for the excellent performances given by everyone but Brad Pitt. At first, I gave Mr. Pitt benefit of the doubt that he was aware of some flaws that I was not privy to in the character he was playing. Then I realized he just wasn't giving it his all. The fact that so many other reviewers gave him kudos tells me that intellectually Americans have fallen way behind in what they look for in a film. We truly are just about 'action, action, action' as Marlene Dietrich once said. Maybe that is why foreign film is so much ahead of us. Too many Americans have been raised on 'TV Movie of the Week' and 'Murder She Wrote' as their mother's milk. They simply don't look for nuances in character and personality. Underplaying is much more difficult that overplaying. Mr. Pitt does a ham actor's job of it. This isn't the first time I've witnessed his gross inability to reel in his own personality. He keeps playing Brad Pitt, bad boy of film as if flip dialog and pouting and shouting can make him the next Brando. It's a shame, but the ending fails enormously and I think was predictable. Hitchcock has nothing to worry about even from the grave. Mr. Pitt would make a much better scandal rag subject or part-time male model.",5

14 January 2012,A good thriller,"David Fincher's now-classic neo-noir isn't as shocking as it was 15 years ago, neither in its levels of violence nor in its twisting plot. As serial killer films go, I believe Fincher outdid the achievements of Se7en with the underrated Zodiac - Zodiac's cynical indifference was to me more original and more poignant than Se7en's ominous manipulation. Zodiac's main point was lack of consequence; Se7en pretends to have more consequence than it actually does.

But consequence or not, Se7en remains a perfectly solid thriller, entertaining, gripping and extremely well-crafted. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both give understated but very fitting performances, and the masterful cinematography makes for a very powerful experience, 15 years later. A masterpiece it ain't, but a very good piece of film it certainly is.

23 April 2020,Near perfection of a crime thriller,"Maybe it took me way too long to get to this movie but at least I was well prepared for what was about to come, not fully though. Se7en is a story of two detectives, played stupendously by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, who lead the investigation of serial murders based on seven deadly sins. For me personally there were never any certain things that are unlawful or forbidden - it is a matter of personal beliefs and values that each individual defines for himself - but this movie has made me look at those from a different point of view. In any case a murder, no matter what its nature and motive are, should not be tolerated and Se7en gives you plenty of grains of wisdom to think about while you try and figure out the murderer's nature and motive. Although at times very depressive and hard to comprehend the movie showcases a vast variety of emotions the main characters are going through - I'd like to especially point out Brad Pitt's character who you vouch for and empathize the most - at times it also shows signs of predictability and lazy writing but despite all that Se7en is no doubt one of the greatest movies of all times in its genre.",9
30 July 2002,Superb thriller!,"This is one of the most expertly structured thrillers I have ever seen. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are great. From writer Andrew Kevin Walker, the writer of the disgustingly terrible 8MM and SLEEPY HOLLOW. This film was much like 8MM as the murderer (whose name is not featured in the opening credits so as to surprise you) seems to have no remorse for what it is that he has done. Andrew Kevin Walker has created a more likable thriller with SE7EN, a film that still shows killing in a very graphic nature, but is not as vulgar or sickening. But, the film is far more violent. The killings are very horrific and disturbing.

Two detectives (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) are on the trail of a killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a calling card on his random murders. The supporting cast includes Gwyneth Paltrow (in a much smaller role than she usually plays), John C. McGinley, Richard Schiff, Kevin Spacey, R. Lee Ermey, Leland Orser, Richard Roundtree, Richard Portnow, and Charles Dutton. Many of the characters that are listed as main ones, have very small parts to play. The film mainly revolves around Freeman and Pitt and the elusive killer. The film was destined to become a classic in the genre. And, it did. SE7EN is one thriller you have to see. SE7EN gets 4/5.",10

2 September 2006,seven,"absolutely appreciated the movie upon first viewing and subsequent viewings....however, now after brad pitt's divorce and unseemly behavior with another woman resulting in birth of a child, my appreciation for the actor and movie have been altered. surprising, even to me, the movie does not hold the same significance....i thought i could rise above my personal feelings at brad pitt's apparent lack of integrity without it affecting my feelings for his movie/movies, but i cannot. he, like others, have nosedived in image for me. it makes me very sad, because i enjoyed enjoying success for him, especially after hearing about his climb to stardom, i.e., standing on the street in a chicken suit, etc.

20 April 2014,One of my favorite movies,"This movie is really good. First, it has two of my favorite actors: Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey so you know it's going to be good. This movie is based on a man's (played by Kevin Spacey) obsession with punishing people who he believes are partaking in one of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play the detectives after him. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the wife to Brad Pitt's character, and while it may seem that she doesn't play a crucial role in the movie, her character turns out to be pivotal in how the end of this movie plays out. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about serial killers and those who distort the Bible to their own beliefs. If you have a weak stomach, though, then this movies might not be for you. There are a lot of disturbing images and swearing throughout so I would not recommend it for children. Also, parents really do need to use their judgment when it comes to letting their teens watch it. It's rated R for good reason.

23 January 2001,Trashy movie...period.,"This movie is an example of sick and trashy flick but people (who are these people??) obviously think its great. How people managed to find such a dark and no brainer plot wonderful is really beyond me. I was surprised that people like Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow would be involve in such an in-human violent movie. Not entertaining and definitely not making positive influences for entertainment or society for that matter.

10 February 2005,Is there a point to this movie?,"First off, I loved it. I'm not trying to say ""this movie is terrible and it has no plot,"" cause that's not the case. Se7en was interesting to watch and had a lot of mind bending situations that made it hard to follow. As long as you focused, you got the gist of it, but I don't see a point to it.

The Seven Deadly Sins are used as a murderer's motives. He believes that these sins are practiced daily, and no one thinks otherwise. Now, he takes revenge on 6 (in a way, 7) people to show that each one is living for a wrong reason and believes that their deaths will have him become notorious as a killer, but in the same way, a hero for showing people the right path.

I gave it a 9 out of 10 because the movie grabbed attention and played it out in a way that made the viewer have to read the killer's mind to follow along. Somewhat like Hannibal Lector. Plus, I loved the beginning credits, amazing camera work.",9
2 January 2021,Absolutely brilliant film,"I'm mainly just writing this review for my own personal collection. But wow, what a film this is.

I remember watching it like 10 years ago and thinking it's good, but fast forward to today where I appreciate films so much more I understand why this film is so highly rated. The plot is great, really gripping from start to finish and the chemistry between the 2 main characters was so good to see.

The film isn't confusing at all, which was one of my main concerns and it wasn't boring at any stage, which is a common problem with a lot of films that surpass the 2 hour mark.

I mentioned it prior, but one of my best things about this film is the connection between Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. They both acted the roles unbelievably well and the chemistry just improved throughout and you genuinely felt a bond.

But yeah, fantastic film and I highly recommend if you haven't seen already.",9
18 January 1999,Riveting,"What can I say about this film that hasn't been said time and time again. Everything about this film is first-rate, especially the hugely talented cast. Is it even possible to make a bad movie with Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey? The actors hammered home a script that was chilling, disturbing, and altogether memorable in every imaginable way. And then to top it all off, this movie has what is probably the most magnificent ending that I have ever seen. If you can handle the content of this film, then it is truly a must-see.

21 June 2020,Gritty detective-vs-murderer thriller of high class,"When this movie was new it was all over the press. The hype about a dark and horror-ish thriller was everywhere. But I was too young to see it. Later. I remember seeing some parts of it on tv in the early 2000's but for some reason I never saw it all the way until now.

It's a very good crime thriller with gritty atmosphere, continous suspense, twists and turns. It's probably one of the best films directed by David Fincher. And the actors are very good too. I think this is the moment when Brad Pitt transformed from a pretty teen idol to a more serious actor. Morgan Freeman had more career behind him but also for him this movie was a big spotlight.

The plot is interesting and I get a little bit of Dirty Harry vibes from it, because there's an intelligent and dangerous serial killer on the loose, and the detectives try to outsmart him. That's actually all you need to know. If you like intense crime thrillers, just watch it!",8
28 June 2014,Brilliant,"This film had all the makings to be fantastic, and it delivered perfectly. Pitt and Freeman complimented each other well, and their characters' bonds was believable and real. The only reason i did not feel this was worthy of 10/10 was due to the predictability of the end... no spoilers of course but i did see this coming after about an hour of the film, and although the ending is performed very well, i feel a shock element might have just given this film an edge.

Overall really enjoyable, enough gore without being too disgusting, and smart dialogue that keeps you interested even when it isn't necessarily action packed.

30 March 2011,Geeky Randy's summary,"Superbly crafted mystery about two detectives, one a veteran (Freeman) one a rookie (Pitt), on the hunt for a serial killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. Isn't dated and is an instant classic. Ermey and Paltrow are well-cast as supporting characters. Scary, thrilling, memorable; but predictability is nearby, and even the climatic twist doesn't appear to be as shocking as intended. Some of the characters' back-story (specifically Freeman's) seems to be overly developed and completely unnecessary to the plot at hand. Still a terrific pulls-no-punches crime-thriller that made David Fincher a recognized director, and rightfully so!

***½ (out of four)

15 June 2021,Superb Film. Perverse Story.,"I love good film, and the three (3) pillar stool it sits atop: story, acting, directing. Technically, this film has all three (3), hands down, but I cannot watch it through again - it's just too perverse. Half way through this time I just couldn't stomach any more of the sick, perverse depravity of humans.

Yes, that's a personal reaction to the content, not the film's quality. Here's my usual assessment:

STORY: The story isn't terribly unusual, but it's a very well-crafted serial murder mystery. My chief problem with it is the ""super-villain"" stature of the antagonist - it's simply not plausible. This is a common technique in film, and it's there to ensure the evil minstrel is extremely difficult to catch, and thus the chase endures.

However, here there are enough clues and suspense to keep the viewer pinned, so in that it's a success.

ACTING: Normally, I am not a fan of Brad Pitt. While he tried to stretch his character range in the ""12 Monkeys"" it was a flop in the attempt and in the film as a whole. But here, his personality fits perfect for the role: handsome, impulsive, cocky, and trying to rise to a level he simply isn't suited or ready for. Freeman is, well Freeman. I wish he'd do some stretching himself, but there wasn't another actor I would have chosen for the role - perfect. All other cast members fit just fine.

TEMPO: An excellent pace to the film. No complaints (surprise).

CINEMATOGRAPHY: The scenery and sound are one of, if not the, crowning achievement here. Unless you're numb to this sort of film, you can only shutter and gasp at the horror depicted here, and it's done well - too well. Frankly, I just couldn't watch anymore of this because it's just too raw, and splays Dante's hellish imagination into your face.

DIRECTING: Fincher is one of the best directors on the globe when you look at his resume: ""Alien,"" ""The Game,"" ""Panic Room,"" ""Fight Club,"" ""Zodiac,"" and of course ""Seven."" They're all gritty, dark, scary movies that show exceptional directing talent.

What's highly unusual is that he directed only short film, and then bang! - he directs ""Alien."" Very impressed.

A note on the writer: this guy hasn't done a lot, but his penchant is towards the dark side of things. Well-crafted story, but far too sick for my ethics.

Overall, this is a very good film as film-making goes. I simply can no longer tolerate these stories, and the perversion they express as a form of entertainment. (Frankly, if this is ""entertainment"" ... we are so f*ucked as a species.)",8

12 April 2007,"Woah, that hit me hard, OUTSTANDING","I just watched Se7en, which stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey and I was gob smacked at how well crafted the storyline and ending are. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are searching for a man only known as 'John Doe,' he is killing and preaching at the same time by killing people based on the Seven Deadly sins, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Greed, Lust, Wrath and Pride as his motive. Somerset takes this case as his last one before he calls it the quits and Mills is a new detective, who doesn't usually listen to the much more experienced Somerset. The story unfolds with the detectives trying to track this killer after he is toying with the police leaving no fingerprints and hardly any clues of any kind. I won't tell anymore but there's not many dull moments and the ending is like no other I've ever seen. From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over. Very Highly recommended and I would give it 9/10.",9
9 January 2020,A brilliantly twisted crime-thriller,"A brilliantly twisted crime-thriller about two detectives solving a series of murders. Great acting from Freeman, Pitt and the killer. It's one of those movies where the crescendo comes literally 2 minutes before the credits roll, and it's a beautiful thing... it leaves you awestruck by what just happened, and as you walk out of the cinema back to your car, you're still thinking about the movie, trying to make sense of it all.

5 February 2006,A Pound of Flesh - and much more not less,"This picture wants a piece of all of us and it gets it. It's relentless in what it depicts and I think it's one of those cases when the overall result somehow surpasses the original intent of the filmmakers, however great that intent was. It's an unflattering depiction of our society, a picture of the world which happens to be the point of view of a serial killer. His world is dark, but made so by the so-called human beings infesting it - all the banality, the apathy, the self-interest of our species is on full display here. The city in this film is in a state of perpetual decay; all we seem to see are rotting walls and buildings on the verge of crumbling. But this is just a surface corrosion, a reflection of what really ails all of us, which is the corruption of our souls. The serial killer is just a natural extension of society here. It comes as no surprise that he exists. We've made our hell on Earth and the killer is just one of the elements existing to fall neatly into place in the center of it all.

Under the guise of a police procedural, director Fincher and the screenwriter unveil this grim world for us. This was not a reworked draft which fell into the common pitfalls of a standard chase at the end or a last minute rescue. No, none of that same old Hollywood stuff here. The nasty foreboding probably surfaces around the time we get to know a little about young detective Mills (Pitt) and his pretty wife (Paltrow), through the eyes of hardened veteran detective Somerset (Freeman). It's hinted that the young couple have recently moved into the big city from a more rural area, into the typical squalid apartment lifestyle prevalent in this grimy city. Maybe some alarm bells go off in the back of the audience's mind by this point: we don't think this couple should be in this city. What in the blazes are they really doing in this hellhole? Why didn't they stay where they belonged, close by that high school where they met? Pitt is pretty good as the less experienced cop, not too intelligent but struggling anxiously to be in the big leagues. He does OK, but the film belongs to Freeman, who cannot strike a wrong note as the older weary policeman. This becomes the essential Freeman role, that of a man who perhaps has seen too much in his lifetime, but his keen intelligence cannot allow him to simply give up and throw in the towel, no matter how close he gets to that point. Freeman manages to convey a poetic disposition towards decency and civilization, as with most of his roles, but it's never more effective than here, when the entire world assails him with barbarism and anarchy.

It's little surprise that much of the style of this film was copied over the next few years, including even the unusual credits sequence. The bulk of the film details the serial killer's masterpiece of murder, a pattern following the seven deadly sins. While interesting in itself and grisly in the depiction of murder as an artistic creation, we realize by the climax that it was all simply a preparation for the truly horrific crowning achievement of killer John Doe's final act. It's a shock at the end which still sends shivers down my spine no matter how many times I watch it. Perhaps meant for repeat viewings after the initial shock, the film serves to remind us we live (or just exist) in that chaotic charnel house we usually try not to think about. When all the surface gloss is peeled away and we gaze with unfiltered eyes at the unpleasant truth laid bare before us, we see John Doe smirking at us, holding a box.",10

9 August 2009,Dark and Provocative Thriller,"In ""Seven,"" it's always raining. Some parts take place in daylight, but the world is dark, gloomy, and decrepit. And this makes for a dark and disturbing thriller.

Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is trying to finish up his last week before he retires. To that end, he shows his replacement, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). But before introductions are over, they are facing a brilliant killer with a diabolical plan.

David Fincher is known for his visually arresting and atmospheric films, and ""Seven"" is no different. This is a film that is drenched in atmosphere and menace. From the first frame, it is clear that this will not be a happy movie, but one filled with violence and menace. But for all the effort that goes into the film's look, it's not that involving. And that is the film's biggest problem. ""Seven"" is still a good film, containing many moments of genuine suspense, and it's always engaging.

In murder mysteries, the protagonists are usually stock characters, leaving the only real acting to the villain. Not so here. Mills and Somerset are clearly different, and Pitt and Freeman are up to the task of making them seem different. Somerset is quiet, reflective and patient. Mills is the exact opposite: arrogant, hyper and quick to action. He only wants the answers, but not the context to understand the kind of person he's pursuing. Gwyneth Paltrow is largely wasted, but she makes full use of what she's given.

Many thrillers have unexpected plot twists, and ""Seven"" is no different. DO NOT, under ANY circumstances, allow anyone to reveal the last 20 minutes to you. The film's ending is one of the greatest twist endings in film history.

""Seven"" is a unique thriller, and a pretty good one at that. But it could have been a lot more.",8
7 November 2014,'Se7en' (1995) brings the horror down to earth,"Horror films often pertain to the supernatural, but what's even more frightening is realism. David Fincher's 1995 thriller ""Se7en"" provides a grounded tense race to catch a serial killer. Slow moving, gritty, and disturbingly plausible, it's a great break from the sequel-ridden franchises filled with villains who won't stay dead.

In an unusual pairing, seasoned Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) teams with newcomer Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt). The two are polar opposites: Somerset is near retirement, and hardened by his years on the force, whereas Mills brings an upbeat enthusiasm. The partners investigate a string of grisly murders, which they discover are based on the seven deadly sins: greed, gluttony, pride, wrath, envy, sloth, and lust.

Several elements complete the terrifying portrait ""Se7en"" paints. Visually, there are graphic murders, but moreover sadistic and methodical killings. During their investigation, Mills and Somerset reveal that the killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), has been planning his attacks for over a year. There's also the stark realism. Unlike pure evil entities like Michael Myers, Doe actually has justification for his crimes, albeit lunatic ravings, but he nonetheless attempts to rationalize his actions. Additionally, Doe doesn't strike in dreams, has no distinguishing traits, and is relatively average, except for the whole psycho killer thing.

Rounding out the haunting genius of Fincher's film is a disturbing, and completely unforeseen ending. No spoilers, but suffice it to say you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. ""Se7en"" scares through mimicking the profiles of actual serial killers, rather than relying on paranormal villains. There's a thought-provoking theme of manipulating religion to validate one's own actions and beliefs, a relevant and adaptable topic. A thrilling scramble, ""Se7en"" is an unconventional horror flick with the biggest blow arriving just before the screen fades to black.

21 April 2020,One of my favorites and one od the greatest od all time,"Seven is a movie that made Fincher break into the Hollywood elite and become a top director. But it was not easy to come by. Before that, he only recorded music videos and then got the dream opportunity, to shoot Alien 3, continuing the great franchise and succeeding two legendary directors: Ridley Scott and James Cameron. However, he did not get his hands free for the movie, his studio got too involved in his work and failed to make the movie as he had imagined it. Fortunately for him, but also for us movie lovers, the movie Seven shot the way he envisioned it and as a result we got one of the best thrillers of the 90s. In this film, we see the director's clear signature, and he uses it in almost every subsequent movie, which is an atmosphere and an unexpected twist. The shop takes place in a nameless city, the atmosphere is gloomy, pessimistic, dark, the rain is constantly falling and the sun is not visible at all. The city is a complete replica of this kind of weather, this is a city where a woman is taught to shout a fire not help, where a robber stabs a victim in both eyes after a robbery, as we learn from the conversation of the protagonist. The lead roles are interpreted by the brilliant duo Freeman and Pitt as two detectives who are complete opposites. The first is an experienced elderly detective with no family, just before he retires and wants to leave this city. The other is a younger detective, married, confident and just moving out of a smaller town. What is one last case before retirement, the other is the first case in a new city. This is a very difficult, complicated and brutal case. We have a serial killer who tortures and kills a new victim every day who is associated with one of the 7 deadly sins. The killings are extremely bloody and brutal, in addition to the visual imagery, also later when describing their torture. The only breath of positive or optimism in the entire film is in the character of a younger detective's wife. Fincher does one brilliant thing, there is no actor in the opening credits who plays the main villain, and we only get to know him after a good hour and a half of film time. In my humble and subjective opinion, all three actors have achieved one of the best roles in their film oeuvre, and given that all three top actors say so much.

When this movie just came out it didn't quite get the top reviews, the reason lies in the violence in the movie and the bizarre murders. Obviously, it took a certain number of years for this film to sit down and today this film deservedly bears the cult adjective. I also have to pay tribute to director Fincher who completed the hattrick, making three perfect films in a row that only a few directors can boast. Two years after this movie, The Game, his most underrated film, is released, and then two years after that Fight Club, his perhaps best known movie, is released.

Seven is one of my favorite and best movies in general, not just a thriller and of course it gets a clean ten from me.",10
5 August 1998,Great story,"An extremely well written and directed movie starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey. About a veteran homicide cop(Freeman) and his new partner(Pitt) who just transferred to the department. The killer (Spacey) kills people for comitting the seven deadly sins. Then would write the persons sin on the scene of the crime with the persons blood or some other item. That's all I can give away, it's a really good movie that I advise you to go see.

9 September 2023,Masterpiece,"Sure! ""Se7en"" is an intense and gripping thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. With its dark and atmospheric setting, the movie creates a sense of unease that lingers throughout. The performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are outstanding, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. The plot is cleverly crafted, taking you on a twisted journey as the detectives hunt down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders. The cinematography and direction are top-notch, adding to the overall suspense and tension. While the movie is undoubtedly disturbing at times, it's also thought-provoking and leaves a lasting impact. I highly recommend ""Se7en"" for its thrilling storyline, strong performances, and its ability to keep you guessing until the very end. It's definitely a must-watch for fans of crime thrillers. 9/10!

28 August 2018,Good Thriller.,"Well......this was a sometimes slow paced thriller until the last 15mins. There was very little tension n suspense again until the last 15mins. It could have easily been reduced from 2hrs to an hour n half. The story was good n the plot was too.

The acting was really great n the characters bounced off each other quite well.

The ending was surprising but a little bit predictable too.

I recommend this movie especially if you like detective thrillers n drama.

4 July 1999,What would you do?,"Seven is the most deeply disturbing ever made. The horrific brutality of the murders in various scenes stays with you longer then you might like. Great writing, directing, cinematography, special effects, and acting highlight this film and make it one of the 10 best movies in the 90's. The seven brutal murders are either under filmed or filmed in dark unlit places so as to leave the viewer's imagination running in overdrive. Each murder is brutal enough to jolt you and make you not forget it. My personal favorit are lust, and sloth. The man tied to the bed and tortured for a year is sick and twisted as anything I've ever seen. The special effects of this and the gluttony murder are perfect. The writing is flawless in assembling this perfect crime with a purpose. The screenplay makes sure to be as descriptive in the details of each death so as to further the viewer's imagination as though reading a book instead of watching a movie. The creepy dark atmosphere of the movie can be credited to perfect directing. And great performances by the four central characters: Morgan Freeman (who is always great and gives any movie a certain nobility), Kevin Spacey who is perfect as the sick lunatic who's crimes go way beyond that of Keyser Soze, Brad Pitt (in his 2nd best role), and Gwyenth Paltrow who does a maximum job with her minimal screen time. But the sickest question in the movie remains the horric and disturbing end. >",9
9 November 2019,Amazing Story,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9
18 July 2018,One of the darkest and most disturbing film ever,"This film was initially received with lukewarm review is now considered one of the greatest film ever. This film is so dark at its core that it will make you grip on your sit. SUMMARY: This film is about a serial killer who kills people based on the Seven Deadly Sins and Detective Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) and Detective Mills (played by Brad Pitt) must investigate to catch the killer. Se7en is a very gloomy film, so gloomy that I consider the ending of this film as one of the most tragic ending ever in cinematic history and also one of the greatest ending in history. But this film is not really about a serial killer on a killing spree and the protagonists trying to catch them, it's about how this ""city"" is affecting the characters in this film. This is one great example of exploiting the settings to affect the characters. There are small moments in this film that shows that they are in fact humans and not just some random film character. Speaking of characters, all actors/actresses in this film is great especially by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. This is still one of my most favorite film ever.

16 November 2000,What's the fuss?,"So, here we have another one of those ""suspense"" movies...Where is the suspense? Where is the thrill? A film of this genre should have an atmosphere, make you excited, cause you to try to guess what the next move is going to be, and most of all - provide a surprising end. None of those exist in this creation of Hollywood movie industry. If the only way to keep the viewer focused and somewhat interested is by presenting more and more gruesome ways of murder - something is very wrong here. Any R-rated movie from the shelves marked ""Horrow"" in your local video-store can provide such an entertaiment. Yet there are much more expectations from the cast involved in this project. Conclusion: bigger is not always better. This movie is supposed to be ""Silence of the lambs"" times 7, but it is not even close to the brilliant original.

14 April 1999,Should I blame the director?,"I saw this film for the second time the other night just to see if I can understand and appreciate what all the hype is/was about. Well, I didn't understand it this time either. I'm not saying that Se7en is a bad film, because it is not. The film is quite good -- but not as good as everybody else seems to think -- and not nearly as great as the masterpiece it has so often been compared with: The Silence of the Lambs.

However, great acting, great cinematography, great production design, haunting music, and a great script. But, somehow it seems as if the sum of these parts is *less* than the value of the individual part. That is strange -- and a shame. Should I blame the director?

As for the great acting: Morgan Freeman must be mentioned, he's almost always brilliant. And -- naturally -- Kevin Spacey in his small but important role as John Doe. Spacey has a presence that is almost uncanny. He is as brilliant as ever. He's fantastic.

Shame about the film though. (6/10)",8
23 August 2010,Se7en is suspenseful and contains performances that scream for award attention,"Se7en is the very interesting film about a serial killer using the seven deadly sins to kill his victims. That part of the plot alone should urge you to want to see the film, period. It's such an original concept. The writing goes farther than just the psycho killer stuff. It's much deeper and more emotional than that. From start to finish you never feel distant from the characters or the story.

From watching the Siskel and Ebert review I started watching this expecting to get this NC- 17 material that slid past it's R rating. I'm not sure I understand why everyone thought Se7en was incredibly disturbing. Is it? Yes. But you don't see any of the actual murders, just the aftermath. Then again, I am very used to disturbing elements in films, so I may have an immunity to it.

The performances from it's leads are the backbone for the film. Freeman and Pitt, very different roles, very different performances. Freeman's performance is nuanced, but still as effective as Pitt's, who has the showy, obnoxious role. He never fails to show us his intensity. Kevin Spacey's extended cameo here stands out as one of the best performances of 1995. With not even 10 minutes of screen time, Spacey walks away with the film.

Se7en is a suspenseful film, but I look at it more intellectually, rather the entertainment value, though it's very entertaining. It's not as scary as many people think. You're not getting a Scream or Halloween here. You don't see much of the violence...you get to imagine it in your head. And that's what's most frightening.

Mesmerizing from beginning to end. It's close to perfect, what is keeping it from being perfect? I'm not sure, it's some weird conflict at the beginning of the film. It doesn't drag you in at first, necessarily. Other than that, you must see it for it's performances and story, also the editing is so tight it's chilling; 9.5",
28 June 1999,"Successful for genre, but then again...","My approach to Seven was one of low expectations. Based on the stylistic opening credits, I was expecting to be assaulted with low-angle extreme closeup murky cinematography designed to capitalize on human reflex. American film has been thwarted with bad technique in the suspense/mystery genre. Instead of style and creativity, many directors have opted for the ole standby of loud unexpected noises/music followed by the alerting appearance of the villain. Snore...However, such is not the case with David Fincher's Seven. The style of Seven is fairly straightforward for the first seventy minutes of the film: What you see is what you get. Unapologetically grotesque images from the crime scenes of a serial murder and a flood of rain in a dingy, dirty-textured metropolitan city. The plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it was plenty enough to keep you interested in learning about the murderer. However, the main characters could not have been more contrived. Morgan Freeman's character, Detective Summerset, was catatonic to the point of being convincingly dull. The writer went for the starkest contrast with the character Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) by giving him the playground mentality of hockey player turned homicide detective. The results were destructive to the film's effect. In the end, Mills and Summerset do their best to ruin the audience's interest in their involvement. Gwynneth Paltrow would receive mention if her character weren't a mere fixture within a plot. The characters just didn't help this film at all. It was one of those all too often cases where the actors look the part but the part is badly written =( However, much to the credit of the production designer and cinematographer, the mood of this film was still very effective. There was however one other regrettable inconsistency: For the first seventy minutes or so of the film, the audience forcably endures the foul, wet and lonely darkness of the city environment only to have the rug pulled out in the closing moments when the setting changes to a sun-bleached desert scape. Hmmm...7 out of 10?",7
20 February 2005,Too LONG!,"I found this movie rather tedious....it was gritty acting for Pitt, very good performance (as usual) by Freeman, and even Paltrow was good in this one. And the gory details they keep finding out at the murder scenes start to get preposterous. But, alas, it was far too L-O-N-G and could have been shortened somewhat. I think the movie went on far too long - they could have wrapped it up after the first 2 hours, but instead go on and on... And that scene where Pitt chases the suspect seems to never end...rain and all. Rather depressing...and not believable. I find it difficult to give this movie too much of a rating...my '6' is rather generous.

10 March 2000,Master Crafted Modern Thriller,"""There are seven deadly sins captain, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust and envy. Seven.""

A killer is on the loose in the Unnamed City and they are using the seven deadly sins as their MO. Two cops are assigned to investigate, Sommerset a world weary cop, soon to retire, and Mills an experienced investigator, but new to this city and its ways. Its an old combo, but Fincher makes it work, and work well.

Pitt in my opinion is at his best here. He portrays a very believable cop (at least in my experience) dedicated and not too cultured. Freeman, while playing the intellectual-about-to-retire cop Sommerset, brings forth great presence to the movie, the calm ying to Mills raging yang (or is it the other way round?)

Some of the most disturbing aspects of this movie, are not those which we see, but those which we are left to think about. The killer's reasoning behind the murders almost makes it justified, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of all.

The action sequences are all realistic and believable(well, as good as it gets in Hollywood anyway). The constant rain, the dilapidated sets, unique camera angles, innovative film processing and a oppressive soundtrack make Se7en a complete indulgence of the senses.

As for the ending, it has to be seen to be believed.

This movie will scar, but then, isn't that what good thrillers do?",10
12 September 2004,It's not Raymond Chandler's Simple Art of Murder,"mild spoilers here regarding this movie and ""Strangers on a train"" and ""Psycho""

It alway bothers me when things in movies get too complicated and unrealistic. Maybe that's not the point if you are doing a ""comment on our society"" as someone stated here, but to me it matters when you are trying to do a crime mystery / thriller. I didn't get thrilled, so I did not like that movie.

As Chandler wrote it in an essay, if you want to kill somebody, you don't train a snake to sneak into a closed chamber to bite the victim, you don't dress up in a costume (see Edgar Wallace), you don't invite ten people to a remote castle just to kill 'em one by one (Christie). No you simple ambush the victim and kill him in a dark back road or like Hitch did it in ""Strangers on a train"" on that island or the killing of Arbogast in Psycho (yes I know there was a dress involved).

This movie was clearly made before C.S.I. hit the screen. Heck, this movie was made before they invented witnesses or anything else which would be a challenge to the killer, like being seen when he stalks his victims by a neighbor or something... He just enters the apartments of these people like he owns their places and then kills 'em in the most complicated way just to create the effect. And he gets away every time. He's a genius, he's better than Arsène Lupin, better even than Keyser Soze, better than the Joker, you name it.

Make your comments on society and do a movie like ""American History X"". Make a thriller - do it Hitchcock-Chandler-style. But is it just me and old Raymond who prefer it that way??

13 June 2020,Still a great thriller with a terrific twist ending.,"Any movie buff will tell you that the mid 90s were glorious years for Hollywood cinema. They will also tell you that Seven was and still is a great film from that era. Although Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt make a terrific pair in this buddy cop neo-noir psychological thriller, this film has one of the most intense, nail-biting, suspense driven final moments ever written for screen. And then, if that weren't enough, there is that unbelievable twist ending that no one saw coming. The secret weapon in this film is not only the serial killer who is always one step ahead of these cops, but the fact that this character remains hidden throughout of the story. You won't even find him in the official movie trailer and for good reason.

19 April 2003,Disturbing Ending,"I'm very fond of David Fincher's movies (favorite: Fight Club),and finally had a chance to see ""Se7en"". It had all the Fincher elements I like , the tone of color, the density.... The plot is generally fine, but the ending was just too much for me. It left me really sick. I know the ending is where the climax is supposed to be, and it did strike me hard, but I just can't have a nice feeling for this movie.

Usually I'm not very much disturbed by shocking endings(survived Hannibal!), so I don't really know why this particular movie made me feel bad. Anyway, you are warned.

3 September 2020,I love a good reason behind torture,"If there is anything that makes a movie enticing to me, it is an exceptional villain or psycho, in this case. I've been obsessed with the ""Saw"" series all of my life, being hypnotised and thrilles by the supposed ""villain"" philosophy and mindset. This is also why the biggest plus point of this movie is the brain behind the horrendous murders. It is what pulled me in, more than the actual solving of the murders did.

The movie starts slow, and with characters I could not perse relate to, or feel close to. I never got this connection build up, but this could be due to my own very different personality.

20 November 1998,"Freak me out, the most chilling thriller next to ""Silence""","Silence of the Lambs is one of the best serial killer movies in my book, and this one ranks second. Chills me every time I see it. The ending is the most shocking thing you will ever see. I saw this in the theatre twice and bought it when it came to video. Movies rarely touch me and have me thinking for a few days after but this one had me trembling coming out of the theatre. Recommended for the non-squeamish and if you have not seen it, my god run to the video store...

14 January 2002,Scary? You bet!,"This movie scared the bejeesus out of me. I saw it in the theater, was fascinated by it, bought it, and now am afraid to watch it again! This is a gut wrencher from the first murder to the very disturbing last scenes. If you have a weak stomach, you need to be warned. The murders, mirroring the Seven Deadly Sins, are evil incarnate....not really too gory but just so damn evil. ""Lust"" will make you turn your head, and ""Sloth"" will shoot you straight out of your seat. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman do good jobs as the police who are hot in pursuit of John Doe, the killer with the twisted, perverse modus operandi. But it is more the story than the acting that makes this a thriller. Almost anyone could have played the leads; they are secondary to the hair raising, gorge raising plot. If you like a movie that makes your skin crawl, this is the one. Be forewarned, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

14 August 2021,Great atmosphere,"David Fincher's direction always shines with thrillers, and ""Se7en"" is one of the most outstanding examples. Aesthetically one of the best thrillers of its generation, the cinematography is so slick and tasteful that it could pass as a recent film. I also liked the dark and gritty atmosphere of rainy Los Angeles, with old and dirty apartments and oppressively dim lights. In particular, the crime scenes are elegantly designed to reflect the poetic overtones of the killer's project. The screenplay is generally solid with the dialogues, the literary references and the way the relationship between the two leads develops, but the final twist and ending felt way too underwhelming if we consider the engaging premise. Brad Pitt's acting sometimes kills the mood, but Freeman and especially Spacey are at their best here and help to balance him off decently.

8 April 2007,Se7en will never be silenced,"I think it is unusual that while the other great film of this kind of style, The Silence of the Lambs, won the main 5 Oscars, Se7en received only 1 nomination and no wins. While Silence of the Lambs is obviously a great film and is more thrilling than Se7en, I just find Se7en so much more interesting. Enough comparison, heres why I think Se7en is one of the best films ever made.

David Fincher doesn't show you any of the bizarre killings during the film, instead showing viewers the crime scenes and photographs. This gets you really involved in the film, as you form your own gritty mental images of what has happened. The script is fantastic, the murders are bizarre yet ingenious. The killer is a fascinating character. Kevin Spacey asked not to be credited for his role, as he thought people would not be concentrating on the film properly and waiting for him to appear. His performance, although relatively brief, is every bit as good as Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.

The setting David Fincher has used for his unnamed metropolis is excellent, using shadows, dark lighting and narrow alleys to create a dark and dingy place where evil lurks, the perfect setting for this storyline to unfold.

The twist ending is fantastic. Along with Fincher's other masterpiece Fight Club, the twist gives it an extra edge and makes the film better. Se7en is by no means a horror film, but the gruesome visuals and especially the ending make it actually scarier than most horror films.

I wouldn't recommend your first viewing of Se7en to be 2am in the morning like mine, but any other time I would recommend it as strongly as any other film. 10/10",10
8 September 2022,Overhyped trash,"Watched this because it was suggested in a review of a much better picture. This movie sucks. The actors in it are all trash and always make bad movies. The plot is stupid, there is no hook and nothing going on, looks ugly, the sound and music is terrible. Boring as all hell, nearly fell asleep. I couldn't name a single character, they were all dull as hell. Typical Hollywood dreck, kind of trash idiots slobber over because ""big name super good trashy Hollywood actor"" is in it. No, a garbage movie isn't good because they paid out for ""stars"", its still bad.

Stupid title too.

AaaaaaaaHHH they upped the minimum character count and I can never write this much.

Personally I would only watch it once though - because, like the Hitchcock movies, it depends a lot upon the mindblowing mystery and confusion of the things that are going on.

7 January 2000,And the next,"Just after you thought Hollywood couldn't sink any lower after giving Silence of the lambs the film of the year oscar they come up with this. Old style hollywood films weren't necessarily realistic but they did suggest life might be worth enjoying. The ludicrous and wildly inappropriate rock video titles and end titles tell you all you need to know about the hypocrisy behind this film. Despite the fact that the film critiques apathy it chooses the done to death subject of serial murder. Yawn. Even the excitingly shot chase in the middle rips off Blade Runner. It's all lazy stuff with some philosophical disclaimer tagged on at the end to make us think we've witnessed art rather than the bottom line of making a fast buck. It's meritricious crap. But what about Pitt's ridiculous performance, eh? There's no coherence at all, just some constant and bizarre jerking of the head all the time. The scene where he's chewing the fat with freeman about commitment is particularly gem. Keep still man, do you think if you keep trying to evade the camera we won't notice its you? What's sad is films like these have influenced television drama producers into doing dozens of carbon copy series in the UK. Stuff that used to be banned as video nasties now find pride of place in peak slots. The explicit nature of series such as Cracker, Something Evil and McCallum with their gruesome crime scenes and autopsies defies belief. One such plot had a serial killer despatching women by setting them alight with petrol. Thanks America.",

4 September 2022,Very good.,"Ok so with movies like this I like to be entertained from start to finish... I wasn't really entertained until about half way, the acting was outstanding and it had an excellent plot. Loved seeing R Lee, freeman, pitt, spacey and pawltrol in one movie. It would honestly be a perfect 10 if it wasn't for the slow start.... Overall I give about 7.5 I know a lot probably wouldn't agree with me but it is my opinion but still a solid movie with brilliant acting. Maybe I'll watch it again and my score may change but idk I'm sticking with the 7.5 That ending though, very chilling and unexpected and I do like that in movie endings.

7 June 2022,Holds up well,"This film holds up very well and I credit a lot of that to David Fincher, who isn't afraid to let his characters talk and isn't afraid to leave the goriest parts offscreen. This relies on two things: actors and imagination. He trusts the actors to bring the dialogue to life (I never mind dialogue when written and delivered well) and get the material where it needs to be; and he trusts the audience's imaginations are stronger and more vivid than anything he could limit the scariest ideas to visually. I appreciate this is a film first and a thriller second and the casting and execution reflects that.

27 January 2000,"Good but not as good as ""The silence of the lambs"".","You're probably thinking that I am a very harsh guy, comparing ""Se7en"" to ""The silence of the lambs"". Well let me tell you why I am comparing them. The theme of the movie is pretty much the same as the one in ""The silence of the lambs"". I also once saw on a box that it was written and I quote ""better than The silence of the lambs"". Unfortunately, that isn't true. Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow can't give great performances like Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins gave in ""The silence of the lambs"". However, Morgan Freeman is a terrific actor and so is Kevin Spacey and so the two of them together can compensate for Pitt's and Paltrow's performance.

The movie starts off in a house. Someone has been murdered. The sin this person had committed was gluttony and it seemed he was killed in this way: someone held a gun against his head and forced him to eat spaghetti until he bursted open. The detective in charge of this case is an experienced detective named William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and is shortly teamed up with a young detective named David Mills (Brad Pitt). We them have the opening credits and the camera is filming inside the murderer's house. It is filming his hands which are working on a table and you realize how careful the psycho is. He cut off the end of his fingers and put bandages around them simply to be sure the police do not find any finger-prints.

The next murder is committed is a person whose sin was greed, then sloth, envy, wrath, pride, and finally lust. The seven sinners all having been murdered, Mills assumes that the murderer will not strike again and that he has only to catch him. But that's not what John Doe (Kevin Spacey), the murderer, has in mind. No, instead of hiding out after his seven murders, he turns himself over to the police and has a last surprise for the two detectives, a surprise that will horrify them and allow the viewer which one is able to know when to hold back and which one should be holding back.

David Fincher does a better job directing this than directing Alien³. However, I thought there was too much unnecessary gore in the movie. Brad Pitt does a good job with what he is given and Morgan Freeman is as excellent a in any other movie. But Kevin Spacey walks away with the movie and gives probably the best performance as the crazy John Doe whose way to describe a murder is as scary as seeing him commit one. It wasn't any surprise he won best villain of the year at the MTV movie awards. I think he didn't get a nomination for best-supporting actor because he already had one in ""The usual suspects"" which he won. The only disappointing part of the movie is truly Gwyneth Paltrow's performance who seems to be shy in front of the camera. It's a good movie that got a little too much credit but is still worth watching.",6

19 August 2001,Bravo!!!,"Se7en is a good thriller with some strong scenes. The acting performance is very good and the atmosphere is dark and sad through out the movie. This is one of the movies where the bad guy is so bad that you just want to go into the teli and shoot him.

The movie is about a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his motive and it's not a pretty sight.

The ending is one of the things that shocked me about this movie,it is not happy.

So if you are looking for a really scary thriller with some great acting,then se7en is the movie.

25 June 2021,"A Gripping, Tense Thriller","I had a great time watching this film, it follows two detectives, played masterfully by Pitt and Freeman, trying to track down a psychotic killer, and boy what a killer he is. Every time you see a new body you're both revolted and entranced, full of wonder in what foul way this person has been slaughtered. The film is based in reality and every murder feels like something that could have actually happened which just adds to the fear and tension that hardly ever leaves you during the whole 2 hour run time. Every member of the cast plays their part to perfection and the direction by Fincher is superb, once again showing his mastery over the art of film. All the technical parts of the film work well together and overall we as the audience are left with one of the best films in the genre, a gripping, tense thriller that hardly ever lets up. I'd love to go into more detail but as to avoid spoilers I'll end the review here, if you're okay with some pretty disgusting scenes and want to spend the next 2 hours holding onto the sides of your chair give Seven a go. It won't disappoint.

13 August 2008,Turned Out To Be One Of My All Time Favourites,"This generally is a superb movie. I didn't really expect much of this movie, but i adore mystery/thriller movies and well this is epic. I'm not going to bore you with the plot because you probably read it above but i will tell you why it is absolutely a great deserving much higher on the IMDb top 250 list than a measly 34/35.

It is a very eary thriller which is always sending a shiver down your spine because of the constant atrocious weather and dark, empty rooms. Every part of the killers sadistic nature is captured exquisitely during the investigations and i'm glad that lots of clues are found that link to the killers identity whereas in some movies they just get one clue and they know where to go next which bores me. This had so much more depth and each clue and piece of evidence links perfectly into what the killer is going to do next.

I thought Brad Pitt was going to be terrible and i would get to slate down his emotionless acting, yet he was terrific. A great loving sense for his wife and kids and also becomes more likable as his character (Detective Mills) and Morgan Freeman's character (Detective Somerset) become more like partners rather than just cops. Obviously Morgan Freeman played the part amazingly and you always feel he has a great sense of knowledge and wisdom which is what i expected.

Each scene is well thought out and works well with the story so credit to the writer and some terrific music helped emphasise the tension of each scene.

So all in all a spectacular movie which case shall remain off my shelf and in my player for time to come. 10/10",9
16 April 2003,well crafted,"Neat, elegant thriller by David Fincher. Nothing showy, nothing flashy. The director relies on an engaging script and good actors to carry this one through. I also found Brad Pitt as Mills to show some threads of comic genius.

2 March 1999,A Terrible Movie,"""Disturbing"" and ""gruesome"" will be the first reason I did not like this. It makes you wonder how some people admire a movie despite such. And the answer you get is ""It was all stylized, like a cartoon. And it was cool."" There was nothing resembling style or ""cool"" in this film; When people say this, I worry about them. But I'm not saying violent movies are bad. ""La Femme Nikita"" was style. ""Blade"" (with Wesley Snipes) was cool. But Se7en is a homicidal nutcase's bedtime storybook.

The second reason I did not like this movie was the lack of sympathy for the characters. Morgan Freeman has always been a wonderful actor, and his screen presence was a meager improvement for the movie. But what I really loathed was Brad Pitt. He was in a starring role as a detective who wants to investigate these cases so fast he rushes through the movie. He overacts, so much that you feel like you're watching an arrogant high school boy recite Homer's 'The Odyssey.' Pitt's self interest in film has always been an annoyance, if it were just him and another person (besides Freeman) teaming up I would have stopped this movie before it reached the ho-hum finale. When push comes to shove that you find out who the sicky is, *Kevin Spacey* look's about as threatening as a 5-year-old with a cap gun. Gwynyth Paltrow look's like a Kate Moss stand in. Countless flaws. Gratuitous gore.... I wish I new what the high rating was about...I guess some like to give bad movies a second chance.",
27 August 1999,One of the worst movies ever made! Bar none!,"Nothing redeeming here. Just an endless hash of grizzly torture and murder scenes, all of which err from a very bad childhood nightmare. (And you could tell this was done as more of a shock value then for chill.) That's not the downer of this movie, there's so much more. It was poorly written, directed, acted. To explain it's betrayal of genre, there was no suspense in the movie. In order to have suspense, a character must be in peril in some way or something unpredictable and shocking must happen. Nope, not here. Scene after scene was just discoveries of these gory brutalities, all of which were boring just as they were unpleasant. An overrated movie is one thing; It's the hype and the style of a film's release. But here, I don't know why anyone would like this. It's a terrible movie!

Lets look at the perfomances. There was no momentum or sympathy in any of the characters. Brad Pitt was a young smartass cop who couldn't stop using four letter words, Gwyneth Paltow delivers one of the most empty performances of the 1990s (this is someone who got the Best Actress Oscar only a few years later!) and Morgan Freeman is sadly miscast. I'm surpised he still had his contract after this. And Kevin Spacey, as the killer, geez, what a joke!

Does Kevin Spacey scare you? Now, he was psychologically taunting in the Usual Suspects, but otherwise...no. If Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, or Donald Sutherland approached me on the street, I'd be terrified. If Kevin Spacey approached me, I'd feel as if a small kitten was begging me to feed it.Why? The three other actors often play characters that are errie and macabre, eventhough they're unfortunately typecast. Spacey is only a little calmer than neurotic. Do you see the difference there?

This movie was a mess. Imagine falling into a puddle of dog excrement and having the stench on you until you get home to wash it off. The after-feeling of watching ""Seven"" is similar to that, except it takes a long time (or maybe never, in some cases) to clean the filth off.

One of the worst movies ever made. Avoid it like the flu!",
18 August 2018,7 reasons to see Se7en!,"I'm going to give you a different kind of review. This will be 7 reasons to see this movie, since it's called Seven, or Se7en.

1. The story. The plot is very unique-it follows 2 detectives who track down a serial killer who picks his victims by the 7 deadly sins. Example: a fat man has committed gluttony, so he is forced to eat until his stomach bursts.(These murders are described and the aftermath is shown-you will not physically see such actions.)

2. People love it. It has an 8.6 here, it's one of my Marketing teacher's favorite movies, and it's a favorite of YouTube critic Chris Stuckmann.

3. Critical reception. Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 stars upon first viewing but later gave it a full 4 stars, calling it a ""great movie.""

4. The acting is amazing. The stand out actors are Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey as the detectives and the killer, respectively.

5. It was directed by David Fincher. My favorite of his is Fight Club, but he also directed The Game and The Social Network, among other works.

6.The twist ending. ""What's in the box?"" You'll have to watch the movie to find out!

7. It's purely entertaining. Why else would I give it 10 stars? The movie is enjoyable and beloved by many!

There's my 7 reasons. Can you think of 7 reasons to NOT see it?",10
30 September 2006,A Cruel Film But a Very Good One,"I can't recall watching a film as cruel, hard and impressive as ""Seven"". But I think that in this case if the movie had been ""softer"" it would have lost impact and intensity.

Definitely a thriller, ""Seven"" is about the chasing of a serial killer who brutally murders his victims in a sort of punishment for each one's different capital sin. The film is very well conducted by director David Fincher and it is ""catching"" right from the start. Good sort of pale color that helps the atmosphere, well handled action sequences and terrible crime scenes (though they help here to understand how completely out of his mind the killer is).

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are both good as the policemen in charge of the case, and Gwynneth Paltrow is a good support with a more important role than it seems.

If you like suspense films and can stand some real hard scenes and a devastating finale, don't miss this one. Most enjoyable in its genre.",7
20 July 2022,Yeah it's a great film ngl,"David Fincher had a really hard time making Alien 3 and seeing how disappointing it was to moviegoers upon release, it seemed that David Fincher's career was in garbage. But, thankfully, you get a director like Fincher (and to be fair, Alien 3's problems were largely due to studio execs and whatnot) who is talented despite having worked on a bad film, to create a masterpiece such as Se7en and this is the film that saved Fincher's career possibly. Se7en (or Seven), was released in 1995 and was directed by David Fincher (The Panic Room, Fight Club, and Alien 3) and stars Brad Pitt (Ocean's 11, Fight Club, and Megamind), Morgan Freeman (The Sum Of All Fears, Kiss The Girls, and The Shawshank Redemption), Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Sliding Doors, and Emma), and John C. McGinley (Platoon, The Rock, and Highlander II: The Quickening). The film was a critical and financial success upon release and has since been widely regarded as one of the best crime thrillers of all time.

Soon to be retired police detective, Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is brought in for one last case involving a sick and deranged killer who kills people based on the seven deadly sins (pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, and sloth). A young and newly transferred police detective named Mills (Brad Pitt) is brought in as Somerset's partner and the two try and solve who the killer is.

Seven has such a legacy that this film really is the gold standard for modern crime thrillers. Every person out there who watches movies always has an amount (of varying sizes) of films (hailed as classics or the greatest of all time) that just seem to slip past them and Seven was one of those films for me. With Seven being this gold standard for crime thrillers, many ripoffs have came and went since it's release and I have seen a few (Hellraiser: Judgment is one such film). So, with me having seen more ripoffs than the film itself, I was extremely worried that this film would not hold up as well because I have seen the ripoffs do it already. After watching the film, I was left in total shock. A complete WTF of the brain in the best way possible. Within the first few or so minutes, everything that we need to know is established, characters, tone, and the plot. Somerset is established as being wise and smart while also being portrayed as a tired man who clearly needs to settle down and retire without having to be burned out by his work. Mills is the young cop with less experience that of course is expected to clash with Somerset. Cliche? Yes but it works and it just feels right once the film concludes. Both Pitt and Freeman do a phenomenal job in their roles and the two have really good chemistry together and made for an enjoyable experience. The tone of the film is dark and grimy as seen through the set design and camera work and by the content of the film alone. The sets are realistic as they should. From a grimy and dirty apartment where a victim is put on display to even a cramped detective office. The camerawork is phenomenal and I lost count as to how many times I said out loud, ""That is an impressive shot"". A lot of criticism that was largely had with this film upon release was targeted at how depressing the film is. Yes and? Films should make people feel emotion and can be a detriment if there is any lack of emotion. I can agree, this film is not for everyone. But for as depressing and intense it is, I really felt what I was supposed to feel and what makes Seven special (and not from being a depressing film that's bad) is backed by it's gripping story, well written characters, phenomenal acting, cinematography, etc. It really blows my mind that a film like this was made in 1995 as it looks and works phenomenally years and years later. The film had criticism for being gory but I can hardly agree with that. Sure, you see some grisly imagery in the film but the camera hardly lingers on it enough which is a good call as it wasn't supposed to be the focus of the film. A lot is left up to the imagination which can prove to be even more horrific. The film runs at a slow pace, but works as information and clues are given to as little by little, building the suspense up. And boy does it all pay off in the end. When it comes to popular films that I haven't had the chance to watch, with them being in the zeitgeist of popular culture the endings get ruined. But luckily, I never had the ending spoiled and I am so glad I only went into the ending knowing that it was going to be crazy. The ending is worth the praise and price of admission. The film gets to a point where the pieces have lined up and it is where the film's intensity ramps up and pays off. That is how you end a film there.

Seven is a phenomenal film and while it's been said hundreds of thousands of times by other viewers, I just can't help but say that Seven does deserve a place as one of my favorite film's of all time.",10
5 February 2003,Se7en Is Brilliant,"Se7en is about two cops, there is Detective Williams Somerset(Morgan Freeman), who is sick of his job and thinking about retiring. And there there is Detective David Mills(Brad Pitt), who just moved into town, he's kind of a loud mouth and though guy. Anyways, Somerset and Mills get assigned to work on this murder where people are being killed by the seven deadly sins. As the story develops a little bit more, you will be amazed at how brilliant Se7en is. The acting by everybody was great and the whole plot, music and atmosphere were amazing. I would give Se7en 10/10

4 October 2009,The story in the story and the lacking glue,"Although I agree with the majority of the critics that ""Se7en"" (1995) is one of the outstanding horror movies of our time, I still have to warn to overrate it. It is definitely not a masterpiece like, e.g., Murnau's ""Nosferatu"", where you will remember the first appearance of Max Schreck in the gate with a far remote camera until your last day.

First, I do not understand why it was considered necessary to put a subsidiary story into the main story. ""Se7en"" has a default dramaturgy, due to the 7 sins, as, e.g. ""The Lodger"" (2007) has a default structure, due to the killings of Jack the Ripper, not to mention the ""Zodiac"" killer movies, etc. Why was it necessary to put the character of Brad Pitt besides the character of Morgan Freeman? Both are in the rank of detectives - the older is a highlight, the younger a zero - the older stands above marriage, the younger is unable to be a good husband and future father and meanwhile enjoys his three of four dogs. But not enough with that: The writer of ""Se7en"" considered it also important to build in a cross-relation, when Paltrow's character contacts Freeman without letting know Pitt. This one scene as well as their common gathering for a dinner are without any sense for the story, it is painful for Freeman's character - and for the real audience.

Second, after having watched this movie a second time, it has lost all of its initial effects. This has nothing to do with the fact that the highlights of the killings as well as the killer are known now. Movies like ""Se7en"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"", in opposition to, e.g., ""The Ring"", have simply not enough glue to stick so in your head so that you can watch enjoy ""Nosferatu"", ""It's a wonderful life"", ""My cousin Vinnie"", ""As good as it gets"", only to mention so few. What is it that makes a film stick in your head? What is this semiotic glue that makes the film go on in your head when you leave the cinema or take out the DVD from the player? If someone would find the mechanism, it would be easy to construct ideal movies that would guaranteed be block-buster hits.",10
23 April 2001,"Pretty good, if you like dark sinister movies.","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",
30 March 2001,How about an Ass Stinging Sensation,"Dude... this movie made me go back to the store and ask for a refund.. not for the $3.50 I paid to rent it.. but for the 2 hours of my LIFE that it cost me. You people are killing me.. Yes, I'm talking about you. Each and every one of you that said ""Yeah, it's a really good movie"" and then refused to watch it with me. It's horrible.. don't be afraid to say it. Morgan Freeman is a god. Sure, maybe if I was a chick (or a gay dude) I'd think Brad Pitt is a Hattie.. but give me a break. I can't remember the last time I invested this much of my life in WANTING to see a movie and later, wishing I had gone for a drive with Thelma and Louise. If you haven't seen it yet, go rent the Matrix. Sure Keanu Reeves sucks, but at least you know what you're paying for... --SirX

8 July 2021,And he still has hell to look forward to,"This movie will always resonate in my mind as one, if not the, best serial killer genre movies of all time. Definitely not your basic buddy cop film. One of the best villain characters created.

It's not based in reality. None whatsoever. It is a fantasy film. The logistics of everything being carried out as it was would be an impossibility without some sort of Supernatural guidance behind it. And that is exactly what we are mint to believe. But most of people once they reach the Age of Reason all know that Supernatural is a nonsensical word that doesn't have any meaning in the natural universe. Which doesn't deviate from the fact that the film is awesome. Although they did a really hard job of making everything as realistic as possible, even the characters and their flaws and their idiocy. There's some pretty cheesy lines in the film. But the cheesiest of all is when the doctor says, ""He's seen more pain and suffering than anyone I've ever witnessed..... and he still has hell to look forward to"" That is such a ridiculous line that you can tell is written. It took me right out of the film how cheesy and ridiculous the line was. Especially coming from a professional doctor. I'm still giving the film 10 stars because the few flaws that it does have in it is not enough for me to lower the rating on this film from 10 Stars. This is a film that will stand the test of time. And does stand the test of time. I will watch it probably once a year until I die. And if there is a hell, which I seriously doubt if we live in any type of a logical universe, then when I'm in hell I'm sure this film will be available on Digital streaming. Or hell, hell maybe more technologically advanced and there will be like a virtual reality, or you can actually go into the film as a digital entity and view the film while you are in it or play one of the characters. If you're going to go as far as saying that a hell exists you might as well just keep going and make it out to be whatever you want. A fantasy.",10
24 March 2013,A classic that every fan of the genre MUST see,"This movie is one of the best thrillers ever made, in my opinion. It is my favorite together with Silence of the Lambs. The actors are great. I kind of guessed the ending before it actually took place, but it was very fitting to the whole movie. The idea to base the murders on the 7 deadly sins is very interesting. The whole plot makes sense and is well-done. I read that some viewers found it disturbing, which is true, it is NOT a movie for kids. But I wouldn't call this movie particularly graphic or scary. It is right in the middle, suspense and action but no bloody gore or ""shock just to shock"" mentality. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes good thrillers!!

18 June 2000,David Fincher rises from his Alien Ashes and delivers Se7en,"After the unfortunate debacle with Alien3 (they couldn't even get the title right since a lot of viewers thought it was Alien Cubed..but never mind!), David Fincher fights back with a superbly crafted murder/mystery which goes beyond the norm (and others would add, the pail) for police crime movies.

Not a particularly complex story - all we have is a typical Mr Average Man who has finally had enough of present day society's steep decline into...well, as the title almost suggests....the Seven Deadly Sins.

His grisly murders represent each Sin and only a soon-to-be-retired police detective who ""...can't get involved..."" (skillfully played by Morgan Freeman) and his young upstart sidekick (Brad Pitt) manage to unravel the case, but at huge personal cost to both.

Its difficult to know where to start when praising such a brilliant film. But to begin with some of Fincher's old Alien3 directing habits are carried into this film. Most of the story is set in miserable, dank, wet and gloomy places - but this isn't a complaint but only adds to the foreboding that awaits us. You feel as if you're swimming in a pool of slime trying to keep afloat as Fincher moves from one scene to another, never letting the viewer, or indeed the main characters time to take a breath.

Fortunately Fincher doesn't go over the top showing us every murder in explicit detail. He knows we are intelligent enough to work out in our own fetid imaginations what the camera doesn't allow us to see. But having said that, the corpses that we do see would make even Dirty Harry choke!

Editing & lighting also go hand in hand with the cinematography, so too does the splatter-punk music score that surrounds the start & finish of the film. In fact its like a conspiracy against the audience - all the unit directors of the film crew (art, sound,2nd unit, editing, score etc) have ganged up with Fincher to give the viewer a real hard time - a feeling of truly being out there with Freeman & Pitt.

Morgan Freeman is, as always, a pleasure to watch. He seems to have hit all the right moves these last few years, especially in the underrated Shawshank Redemption. His character is very slow, methodical, patient...all those things his partner, Brad Pitt, lacks so glaringly,

Pitt is perfect for the young brash detective. The two cops remind me of reading a book - Freeman plays the cop page by page by page never wanting to cut a corner or skip a detail; while Pitt plays his character chapter by chapter, ever moving forward, not having the patience to look at the minute details on each page...and boy does he get the Early Morning Wakeup Call at the end of the film!!!!

But to my mind, Kevin Spacey, who plays Jon Doe, is the real king player here. Critically acclaimed in The Usual Suspects, LA Confidential & Glengarry Glen Ross), Spacey pulls off yet another masterclass act here.

He is not a madman or psychopath (as Brad Pitt feels he is) even though his crimes would make you think otherwise. Instead he is just a well-educated citizen who has simply had enough of seeing society fall apart outside his front door, and the police & the courts are seen as being impotent to do anything about it.

Spacey knows what Fincher wants from his character and plays it with relish; similar to John Malkovich's Mitch Leary character in Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire.

This isn't a glamour film that will make you glow & smile when you leave the theatre. This film wants to crush you with the sordid reality of what is actually happening to us all out there - a film that tells it as it is, and not as Hollywood wants us to view the world from their glittering perspective.

Se7en is a film where other detective films should be judged. It's unforgiving & relentless but a visual masterpiece for all that...and as for the ending....well.....

4 February 2002,Freeman is the impetus in this modern film noir masterwork,"Like `The Silence of the Lambs', `Seven' is a film that uses intense characters and psychological intrigue to move beyond the limitations of gore and decadence in serial killer flicks. It is, after all, easy to make a film drenched in the depravation of a society approaching anomie, but it is not a simple matter to make it smart and fresh.

Truth be told though, for all the well-exhibited talents of Pitt, Paltrow and Spacey it is Freeman who saves this film from trapping itself into a sordid mess. He provides just the right edge as one of the most interesting cops ever on the big screen. His profundity makes him a pariah to his peers, as he is azygous to the point of being incongruous among lesser thinkers. This is juxtaposed nicely in the scenes where he goes to the library to construe John Doe's literary inspirations, while Mills (Pitt) snags some Cliff's Notes. We quickly note that while Somerset (Freeman) is a bete noire in the police department (probably feared as many smart people are) he is the only person with the intellect required to defeat John Doe.

It is Somerset's contrast that provides suitable pauses in the tumult and allows for Pitt's intensity and Paltrow's tenderness to have convincing voices. It is his erudite manner of investigating the grizzly murders that makes them more than psychopathic folderol in the long book of inhumane criminality. If violence is truly an atavistic impulse, then Somerset reminds us that compassion probably is also.

A very disturbing, yet worthy effort that pays attention to numerous details. A well made film that is highly recommended.",

25 January 2021,A film that has redefined the thriller genre,"Se7en is the archetype for all thrillers that have followed: an ideal mix of good acting, an intriguing plot, and just enough action to satisfy even the most half-awake viewers. Since this released in 1995, everything else in the genre has aspired to be just like it, so much so that you may have felt you've seen something akin to this before.

Built on the victims of a killer working to the maxim of the Seven Deadly Sins, Se7en is ambitious enough to challenge the average onlooker's perception of linear Hollywood thriller clones. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play the weathered detective and the impulsive newbie, working both with and against one another in pursuit of this psychopath.

There is some neat set design (along with some dubious plot holes and omitted details), and the ending has its own cult following; all in all, Se7en is a must-watch for both casual film viewers and the more invested cinematic buffs alike.",8

18 October 2010,Perhaps..... the most absurdly overrated film on IMDb,"Oh my god! Current rating 8.7 and # 28 on top 250 list...!! I think many of IMDb users have gone out of their mind to vote 10, 9 & 8 to such a ridiculous crap.

Yes, it is a fact that i do believe in the voting system of IMDb and it is absolutely true that i consult the reviews of this site before watching most of the films. In 95% of cases my judgment gone true. On the basis of rating and reviews i got disappointed only with two films. One is Se7en and the other is Once upon a time in the West (1968).

Some of the IMDb users are also claiming Se7en to be the best work of David Fincher till date. But i don't think so... Fight Club (1999) is the best work of Fincher till date. It doesn't matter to me what others think about this review of mine but this is not a classic to be rated so high.

""The god inspired and ordered a person to eliminate those 7 people who are indulging themselves to the 7 deadly sins of the universe."" I do admire the insane attitude of the killer but the plot and the entire story was full of flaws. Like in most of the psychological thrillers here also the lead actors failed to read and analyze the mind of the killer. In every crime committed by the killer... he stayed two steps ahead of the detectives. And yes the climax itself was one of the worst i have ever seen.

Watch it only if you are a strong fan of crime thrillers otherwise not! Self - interpretation by the viewer after watching the film is the most important thing... 4/10....I can't vote it more than that..",4

It's up to seasoned detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and cocky newcomer David Mills (Brad Pitt) to track down the killer, who in the end, proves to be anything but ordinary and routine.

Directed by David Fincher (""Fight Club"") and drawn from a script by Andrew Kevin Walker (""8mm""), ""Se7en"" is perhaps one of the most unsettling, most gruesome and most unforgettable thrillers to come from the 90's. Giving even ""The Silence of the Lambs"" a run for its money, Fincher's film is chock full of moody atmosphere and gloomy set-pieces. Rarely do the two detectives stumble into a brightly lit room, and the rain that plagues their non-descript, crime-filled city refuses to let up until the killer is revealed. Coming off of the troubled production that was ""Alien 3,"" Fincher was given a second shot, and with this film, defines a style all his own that had been plagiarized to death by the turn of the century. The cinematography and ambient direction are fresh for its time and hold up today – at fourteen years old, the film still looks stunning – and serves up a truly unique experience. The world created in this film may be too much to stomach for some, as it shows humanity at its worst with a serial killer who considers himself a hero, a savior even. Occasionally the film breaks for some slight situational humor that only serves to further humanize our two main leads, but for the most part, it's a wholly disturbing and gut-wrenching experience, right down to the final reveal of the killer and the inescapable ending.

In a way, ""Se7en"" could be seen as the anti-""Lethal Weapon"" -- A buddy-cop comedy without the comedy or the buddies. Instead, our well-worn pro, just six days from retirement, has been beaten down and drained by the world he lives in and is only leaving the job to salvage what humanity is left inside of himself. The arrogant new guy is fueled by past successes and a hunger for action that perhaps his older counterpart once had but tragically lost. The shocking ending only serves to juxtapose the two characters. Morgan Freeman is solid as always, while Brad Pitt overacts the part just a hair. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife sweet and as human as possible, while Kevin Spacey has a role in this film that can only be described as iconic. With a great cast under the brilliant direction of a budding, young and talented director, ""Se7en"" is as close to perfection as the horror/thriller genre gets.",10

12 April 2020,No words can't describe it,"Simply put, a disturbing masterpiece. Everything was brilliant. From the acting to the screenplay and the cinematography. Wow, I'm still blown away by this incredible film. Kudos to director David Fincher, and of course to Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman for playing their roles so impeccably.

2 August 2008,Se7en good reasons to watch this movie,"I don't know how to describe why this movie is so good, so i decided just to write 7 reasons why i liked it: 1. It has an unpredictable plot line (you think you know what will happen next, but you don't).

2.There were shown a few original ways to die.

3. The movie was very shocking (so it makes it interesting to watch).

4. Well described psychotic killers intentions.

5. No boring moments (you can feel an intense in every minute).

6. Good actors performance (aspecialy Kevin Spacey's performance, i couldn't imagine him playing a psychotic killer).

7. Clever cops (the detectives used interesting ways to get information).",10
31 July 2023,"Stylish, but grotesque and weirdly empty.","David Fincher brings his serial killer obsession to the fore with Se7en, the tale of two detectives being led around by their noses while trying to catch a serial killer. Like all media serial killers, this film's 'John Doe' has a quirky MO: in this case basing his kills off the Seven Deadly Sins, for reasons that don't really make sense even when they're eventually explained. The film takes place in a decrepit city, deluged by constant rainfall, plagued by violence, and filmed through Fincher's trademark brownish hues, (which still looked good at this stage being shot on film). The cops are tired and disillusioned. This atmosphere is impeccable...in keeping the central city unnamed Fincher creates a suitably timeless feeling, an evocation of American corruption analogous to Batman's Gotham City (indeed, director Matt Reeves would lift this film's style and conceit for his mediocre Batman adaption). If the film could pass on this alone, it would be excellent, but there's no way to ignore certain contrivances.

Like most serial killer films, many of which essentially copy Se7en's general plot, the ridiculous machinations of the central antagonist become tiring and irritating. Threatening someone at gunpoint should only go so far; at least I would rather be shot than forced to die in some goofy, torturous manner. Fincher instead indulges all his sadistic impulses, while treating his antagonist's plan with a completely undeserved seriousness. Everything falls so neatly into place like a set of sick punchlines.

It's nice to see a film literate enough to reference Dante, Milton, and Gustav Dore among others, but Fincher doesn't use this symbolism to say anything. He seems to be the type of person who gives up on the Divine Comedy half-way through the Purgatorio when it stops being graphic; someone in it for the grotesquerie and little else. 'John Doe' gives a large speech at the end that's completely unbelievable, yet the film acts like we're supposed to take it seriously. He thinks he's making the world a better place? Really?

'What I have done will be studied in the years to come' he says ominously. What's there to study? He killed people in ways vaguely corresponding to certain vices, so what? Does anyone watching this film come out of it considering anything metaphysical? They don't; fans of this film seem to mostly revel in the atmosphere and gnarly kills, and it's not such a stretch to assume that the fictional inhabitants of this city would react in much the same way. Sin itself becomes nothing more than a gimmick.",3
16 January 2022,Chilling,"With no prior knowledge of the film before watching, I was shocked by it's creative and grotesque nature. It is certainly anything but a forgettable movie.

24 April 2010,grim,"David Fincher's fiercely idolized Seven is certainly an interesting and well-made film. Finely acted, meticulously shot and composed. It very effectively portrays the greatest city on earth as dark and Gothic, rotting and falling to pieces, its citizens weary and confused. What prevents Seven from being a true masterpiece is that there is very little meaning or depth below the layers of supposed erudition. It doesn't help to allude to Dante and Chaucer when your film has nothing to do with their work ; it seems to me that these references were deliberately added just to create a false sense of meaning in the minds of viewers who don't know any better. Ah, Thomas Aquinas ! Hemingway !!! Deep stuff this must be......well, not really, though. The film is content to scratch the surface of difficult ideas, hinting at more interesting things but resolutely going for the cheap thrill nine times out of ten. John Doe is a grand and terrifying killer, but one that exists only in the imaginary world of movies.

2 September 2000,"Very disturbing, but worth while","Gripping, well-written psychological thriller of two New York City police detectives (Pitt & Freeman) trying to solve the murders of one serial killer who patterns them after the seven deadly sins. Unique chiller has some unbearable, gory moments, but the ending will make it worth your while.

16 October 2006,Depressing yet shockingly real,"A depressing yet effective thriller with a completely shocking and disturbing ending that will have you thinking about it for a long time. Yes that is the simplest way to explain David Fincher's Seven.

Seven is a thinking film that will have one questioning society and life in general. Kevin Spacey plays John Doe, a serial killer, and he is perfect in the role. He chooses each one of the victims because they are guilty of each one of the seven deadly sins which include gluttony, sloth, pride, greed, lust, envy, and wrath. What he does to these people is downright horrible and utterly disgusting, but he believes that he is doing God's work by using passages out of books like Dante's Inferno and others. We as the viewers are disgusted by what he does, but during his long monoloque near the end we can't help but wonder that what he's doing seems justifiable in a lot of ways.

The detectives on the case are Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Detective Mills (Brad Pitt). Both are also great in their roles. They are hot on John Doe's trail. One, Mills, the new kid on the block, does his job because he wants to improve things to make the world a safer place. The other, Somerset, is much older and has a very cynical outlook on life. Somerset's opinion is that he just wants to retire and escape from all the madness because he feels nothing will ever get better. Both of their personalities collide, but they continue to work together to solve the case.

Gwneth Paltrow plays Tracy Mills. She is Mill's wife and hates that they have moved to the city. Her part in the movie is a small one and a minor role, but it becomes much more important then anybody could've ever suspected.

This movie, splendidly directed by David Fincher, is dreary, dark, and depressing, but it is a very well made film which has some very strong points that it wants to make. It is well paced and filled with subtle moments that will lead to a very strong impact at the end. I didn't care to much for Fincher's Alien 3 because of how depressing it was, but that was a franchise that had already been started and was never really expected, in my opinion anyway, to take the darker turn that it does. With Seven we are not making a sequel, so it is a whole new ball game, and this time Fincher's skill shines through.

The ending, as I said above is completely appalling, but it is never completely unexpected, and that is because of the smaller subtleties during the movie's running time which helps prepare us for what happens. I was never caught off guard by what finally happens, and that is why this film doesn't quite get a perfect rating. However, if anybody was to ask me if they should see this movie I would say hell yes. I would also tell them to be prepared for some very nasty scenes which will make your blood run cold.",9
21 July 2020,Not exciting enough but still engaging throughout.,"Watched it just after Inferno (2016) so Dante was recently revised. Maybe it's a 1995 movie that's why no twist felt too big to me.

P.S. Now I know why all the girls used to have crush on Brad Pitt. 😍

22 November 2018,Why?,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",7
21 October 1998,A brilliant work,"About a week ago I watched ""Saving Private Ryan"". In the first thirty minutes of the film I felt like someone was punching me in the stomach. That is the same feeling I get every time I watch Se7en. When I first saw it, 3 years ago, I couldn't find the words to express the emotions I felt. I still can't. A brilliant work, by all aspects.

13 July 2022,Your Humanity Erodes a Bit after this...,"A Postmodern film noir, about two police detectives in search of a Serial killer who punishes his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins. This is a Masterpiece in every sense. The writing by Andrew Kevin Walker is so good in every scene that the whole film gets etched in your memory. The direction is brilliant by David Fincher. Its a dark, dreary, hopeless City where evil resides. The murder scenes are gruesomely detailed & some are too mortifying to even be shown. Three top notch performances elevate the film to Greatness. Morgan Freeman's weary age-old veteran cop who has seen the filth for too long and just wants to leave, Brad Pitt's rash & impatient young cop who wants to prove his mettle & Kevin Spacey's Spine-chilling Killer whose words rattle your soul. The Scene with the three of them is the Stuff of Legends. A Crime Masterpiece of highest Calibre which just might erode your hope for humanity a bit.

3 May 2007,It stays with you,"Se7en is an excellent thriller. Sure, it might be a little bit over-stylized and the ending is not quite as logical as it seems to be at first, but none of that disturbs the experience of watching this film.

Every aspect of it is superb, the writing, the actors, the editing, the sound, the music, the direction.

I am not going to repeat the plot yet again.

I just want to point out what makes this film so special: It stays with you. After the first viewing, the images are burnt into your head, the ending leaves you drained and broken and you will think about it for days. Even though the effect wears off after repeated viewing, you can always remember the way you felt after your first experience with this movie. it is so strong that you can even remember it if someone just mentions its name. It is the kind of movie of which you never forget where you saw it first, who was with you and what it was like. I watched it in a cinema 13 years ago and can still remember the exact mood of that evening.

This, in my opinion, is the greatest accomplishment a film can achieve.",10
24 May 2020,As grim as it is magnificent,"Dark, disturbing, haunting... David Fincher's crime thriller masterpiece contains an atmosphere of dread that's so strong, so inescapable, that not even the end credits can alleviate it straight away.

The plot is well-known. Veteran detective Morgan Freeman is a week away from retiring when Brad Pitt, a young new detective, is thrust under his wing as a series of grisly murders based on the seven deadly sins begin.

Laden with unease, gruesome imagery and the power of suggestion, each crime scene effectively translates across its hellish horror. And what is so impressive, is that 'Seven' is pretty much bloodless. We don't see acts of violence, just the devastating aftermaths. We get off lightly.

The mystery steers its way from one crime to the next, interwoven with great character development between its leads. Morgan Freeman delivers an astonishing performance, so nuanced and layered; and even though it's less physically emotive than Brad Pitt's, you can feel the weight on his mind from years gone by; a history filled with regret. His vast experience must try and curb the impulses of his new partner during a week of depravity.

As each new piece of the puzzle slides into place, it barrels towards an unforgettable and shocking finale, leaving you stunned, exhausted, and enthralled in equal measure.

2 January 2000,crap for the masses,"this is a bull**it film heralding style over substance. fincher couldn't direct himself out of a box. like ""american history X"" director tony Kaye, fincher can photograph alright, but neither have any sense of how to make a film. this is a movie for people who understand and are dazzled by flashy camera work, and can be left with a mere impression of that, no story whatsoever, and still find it to be ""powerful."" and kevin spacey (one of the finest actors alive, probably the finest) isn't given a thing to do, while brad pitt is given 2 hours to brood. this movie sucks, and the fact everyone loves it makes it suck even more.

Therefore, ""Se7en"" gets a 10!~

17 July 2023,A well-crafted assault on the senses,"David Fincher's Seven is an extremely slick, stylized, action-packed suspense film. It's very good, but for me it is not in the ""great"" category. I found it too slick, with too much explicit pulp-fiction gore, and an ending that was telegraphed as soon as Gweneth Paltrow's character was introduced. And could we have a few scenes without rain, please? But aside from those aspects, it is a very entertaining and well-made film. Entertaining is a bit of a loaded term, because the film's theme of the Seven Deadly Sins, is, as it should be, also a thought-provoking social commentary. Normally I would also say that we need a very big dose of ""suspension of disbelief"" around the seeming superpowers of the villain, but this aspect of the story and film were extremely well crafted and convincing, all the more so once Kevin Spacey shows up on screen. The film's high points are, of course, outstanding performances from Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey, a very convincing and radiant Gweneth Paltrow, and a very good Brad Pitt. It also has opening and ending title credits with an amazing ""wow factor"" of complexity and artistic achievement, and very atmospheric cinematography and sets.",7
8 February 2023,Hard watch but supreme crime thriller,"If you're a fan of Brad Pitt, Kevin, Spacey and Morgan Freeman, you'll love this. Paltrow serves more of a very supportive role, but does her bit never the less. The film tells of a serial killer who kills people who have committed one of the deadly sins. It's told from the perspective of police detectives on a quest for the murderer. The killer taunts the police back. It's a gripping drama with some gruesome scenes that are unforgettable as well as very dark moments you also can't forget.

David Fincher directs this all-star cast masterfully to bring out some real drama in what borders on horror. A must-see!

Se7en succed. With it's great ""film noir"" touch (rain, scenography, type of acting,...), superb story with surprises following one after another, great acting by Brad, Morgan, Kevin & Gwyneth and a intelligent touch of directing by David Fincher (also used in his next masterpiece Fight club, 7/10).

There is nothing bad about this movie, it even has the perfect duration. PLEASE WATCH IT!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!

17 September 2018,This is a movie that made some of you could not forget so quickly,"This movie is about an ingenious pair of detectives played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt the two are looking for a dangerous serial killer with a scare then precision, totality and pleasure in the days and approach several people murdered according to the motto of the 7 deadly sins.

The stuff has no big stickers or crazy time lines just one of the police's story left on the floor and that's what makes it so disturbing and psycho table then theoretically any of us could pass and so on the floor this is probably the most mental scary movie could be on this list. Every actor here has everything out that only goes with acting from all sides the absolute grasp the fist.

Even Brad Pitt I absolutely do not like makes a good figure here. This is a movie that made some of you could not forget so quickly.

18 May 1999,Excellent,"My goodness, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time of this movie. I did not put the tape on pause once to go to the bathroom. I was, however a little upset at the way Brad Pitts chac. was acting. I mean, cops don't really act so unpolice like. I mean, he had a hot head and he didn't always go by the book. He broke police procedures all the time, breaking into an apartment without a warrant, paying off witnesses to say what he wants them to say. And then at the end of the picture, committing the ultimate act. I won't say what, but he looked to me like he knew exactly what he was doing. He even paused a few times, which tells me he had a ""do the right thing"" thought. But alas.......

24 August 2021,I don't get the hype,"It's a good film I agree but thoroughly disturbing and I have to say, I was disappointed at the end. I had heard there was a twist but this was so predictable and unsatisfying. I could've stopped watching halfway through but stayed to see if the hype was worth it, it wasn't, 6/10 is very generous.

22 April 2000,Ruthless,"Every time I heard about Se7en, I heard about the shocking ending. Finally, I rented it, not wanting to find out about the ending somewhere else. (Which, I found out when it came, I already knew from an MTV Movie Award spoof [damn them]). But I must say, I was still shocked and terrified.

Detective Somerset (Freeman) is nearing the end of his career as a detective when he is assigned to the case of some gruesome murders, with rookie detective Mills (Pitt). As Somerset and Mills continue a helpless investigation, it becomes evident that the murders are based on the Seven Deadly Sins, and the two detectives must fight to stop this killer before he strikes again..and again...and again.

A ruthless, bleak movie. I was numb by the end of it. For the most part, towards the beginning, the only thing that distinguished this from any other detectives-after-a-serial-killer movie (which there are far too many of) was how gruesome the murders were, and the fact that the primary female character, in this film Mill's wife Tracy (Paltrow), wasn't sent to stay with her mother halfway into the film. The murders themselves were quite disgusting, one guy being fed spaghetti until he died (which can either be sort of silly, or just downright disgusting) and one woman whose face was cut off, and then, while still alive, given the option of calling the police and living with a disfigurement, or overdosing on sleeping pills and putting herself out of her misery. All of this is implied after the fact, but it's still just as terrifying, and just as revolting. The acting is all quite impressive, especially from Morgan Freeman, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey, who played the killer. Brad Pitt was alright; I didn't expect much from him, other than long spouts of profanity, which he allowed to the audience countless times. As for the climax...it was as shocking as reputated. I can't give anything away, but it was extremely well-written, especially in the final outcome, and also extremely tragic, and tragic only for how much the audience wouldn't have wanted the truth of the climax to be so. But those were some of the most tense scenes, leading up to the delivery. I could barely sit still. And after the movie ends, you're only left to think and be shocked.

I do recommend this, but only for those who can handle such a bleak, tragic, brutal movie. If anything, it's one to be seen to be believed.",
26 June 2023,The hidden masterpiece,"This is the film that introduces David Fincher, also I think this is one of his best films.

The pillars of this film are Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, but the one who makes this film a masterpiece is Kevin Spacey, in fact he is the perfect ""antagonist"" who drags us into his game until the end of the film, a film that has a good pace but completed with a splendid ending, considered by many, myself included, to be one of the best endings in history.

A film full of twists and turns in which two detectives, one rookie and one veteran, respectively Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, hunt down an extremely intelligent serial killer, Kevin Spacey. Nothing else to add for this splendid film.

3 March 2022,Jaw-droppingly brilliant,"To me personally, Se7en is one of the greatest films ever made. The attention to detail, amazing storyline and perfect cinematography comes together in one big dark, unsettling and intriguing masterpiece of a movie. One of the few films I would consider to be near perfect.

13 November 2021,Too gory for me sorry,"I didn't like how they twisted God's Word into a serial killer machine - they will stand before a real God someday for this film. Fear motivates people and could have brought about the changes that all the characters wanted to see take place. That would have been an interesting movie--people dedicated to maintaining order realizing that the order needs to be subverted to do actual good. That is an interesting conflict. Could the divorce really happen? The groundwork was there for such action to take place, but the result would have been too thought-provoking to be thrilling for the average viewer. Fear shapes people's behavior more than anything else, when present. Think about how many churches you see on your way to work. Inertia takes over when fear is absent. The killer was too calculating to suffer so many ineptitudes. Overall, I didn't like it. Sorry.

3/10.

23 March 2014,This Particular Movie Fits My Mania For Authenticity,"Se7en has it all, yes and somewhat still does pretty Damn well (compelling entertainment wise) without the very marketable Nudity and Sex... Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are outstanding in there given roles as very darkly humored and temperamental detectives out to find a very deranged and disturbed psychopath who basically gruesomely murders his victims using the Se7en deadly wicked sins played so ingeniously by the epic Kevin Spacey. A must see if you care for the very very Dark side of Humanity Se7en is a rare Treat Directed By David Fincher And Can be watched Till basically Your time on this very mixed up Planet is up...

16 March 2022,Mixed Feelings: Intense Thriller with Cringy Dialogue,"Se7en is about two cops, a newer brash detective (Brad Pitt) and a jaded veteran days from retirement (Morgan Freeman) investigating a serial killer who chooses his victims and punishments based on the seven deadly sins.

Once it gets rolling, it's an excellent thriller with a tightly designed plot that's sadistic and memorable, if bleak and depressing. The set designs are slick and the crew's creativity is on full display. As for negatives, some of the dialogue is eyeroll-inducing, particularly for Brad Pitt's character in the earlier portions of the film. The hate-each-other-then-buddy-cops partnership came across as cliche for such a serious film, and the same can be said of the caricature of lawyers. Finally, without giving it away, Morgan Freeman's ""secret connection"" felt utterly implausible, like a classic deus ex machina where they could not concoct any other way to advance the plot.

On balance, the films left me quite mixed. Some of it truly was excellent. Some of it certainly was not. I doubt I ever would rewatch it, but it's definitely worth seeing once.",7
7 October 2004,A classic chiller,"To put it simply - Seven (i think the 7 in the title looks damn stupid) is the best film I've seen. As far as the pure cinema experience goes, I it shares the number one spot with Titanic (yes Titanic, no I'm not crazy), but Seven is the only flawless film I can think of.

The story is pretty straight forward, but when Seven came out, the world hadn't yet been flooded with gritty looking, inferior serial killer rip-offs. There's a beauty to the simplicity. The film never takes the cheap way out, and deserves a lot of credit for that. There's a refreshing lack of clichés that makes it all the more easy to watch (just look at R. Lee Ermey's police captain - normally they only yell and scream at the hero, refusing to believe whatever theory he's got, but in Seven he actually listens to, and supports his men).

The acting is superb all round, and the chemistry between Freeman and Pitt is pure magic. The work behind the camera (Fincher's Fight Club may be the flashier one, but this is his masterpiece), and on the sets are equally impressive. The atmosphere and setting really pulls you in to the film, never letting go until the end credits roll. And the ending... the best one ever filmed, period. [10/10]",10
12 September 2021,Such a cool and dark thriller,"After a long time I finally came to watch this classic. First of all Morgan Freeman in a crime movie? This alone makes this movie so cool and also Brad Pitt is amazing in his role. This movie's sheme was dark as hell and it is perfect for this type of movie. The actor wich I don't say the name because I don't want to spoil was amazing even though he wasn't much seen. Overall I can say this is the perfect movie for those who like this genre and even for other people.

21 October 2017,"Timeless Gem, Clever and Thrilling to the Climax","I should've watched this a decade ago, it's a masterpiece, it kept me thinking all the time, the suspense and the atmosphere are both unheard- of. Vehement scenes, gory, and tragic aura casting off from beginning to end.

This movie is the perfect example of Drama, Crime, and Serial-killer genre of movies. It had everything you need, and I liked how the main duo (Pitt and Freeman) fit in with each other.

Se7en discusses the philosophy of the deadly sins subtly from the serial killer shoes, and yes, not every case comes to a satisfying end.

Se7en is much more than you expect, whether it is 2017, 2025 or 2040, go to watch it now if you haven't yet.

9/10",9
21 January 2003,Exceptional,"This is perhaps Fincher's best work to date. The story is flawless mainly because of the realism present in it. The writing is primarily what holds the story together. It goes within the killer's mind to the point where the viewer almost agrees or at least cannot deny, the validity of his arguments. Fincher also does an excellent job to convey the unpleasantness and claustrophobia of a crime scene to the point where the viewer can almost smell the acrid bodies. It takes the suspense genre and redefines the cinematic serial killer with outstanding performances by the whole cast. It is a film that can withstand time and can pertain to any future generation. Truly a classic.

27 February 2003,An excellent mystery thriller by a brilliant director,"I really like David Fincher. Each one of his films has a unique visual signature to them and are trademarked with an excellent story. I didn't hate Alien 3 at all. This is his second best film, Fight Club being the first. Everything in it is so well done, from the acting (Kevin Spacey!), directing, script, and visuals. The city this takes place in isn't named but its shown as dark and gritty, constantly raining. The mystery is intense, its something I have never heard of before but it is done so remarkably well. Its hard to find a film like Se7en around, it can only really be matched by Memento. The last twenty minutes of this film are extremly suspensful, possibly the best end twenty minutes of any film. The script is my only problem, because sometimes it gets sloppy and Brad Pitt just unevenly swears. Otherwise, its an excellent thriller that I didn't find shocking at all. 9.5/10

1 October 2004,Pseudo,"Brad Pitt is not likable, completely uninteresting. Want him to die as quickly as possible so Morgan Freeman can get more screen time. Saw the ending coming miles away. And then the film just dragged along at 10 mph wanting to involve me in a drama about Pitts characters final decision regarding whet ever to kill in anger or control himself. Oh-ho! Guess what happens!

This movie should have been done from the serial killers pov - with him as the hero and Freeman as the real anti-hero. And a different actor than Pitt- Has he ever played something that goes beyond 2D?

It is a pseudo-artsy film with no real depth. A postulate. A mental exercise without any real drama. Bad script and bad script directing. Fincher don't know how to tell his story. He only got it right in Fight Club.

28 December 1999,A EXCELLENT SERIAL KILLER MOVIE!!,"Seven is a great dark thriller, and in my opinion will be the benchmark for all serial killer movies to made. The film is very good, and the aftermath of the killings is also great. There is a killer killing people by the seven deadly sins. Greed, Glutony, Wrath, etc. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play detectives trying to find out who the killer is and why he is killing. Kevin Spacey's performance towards the end of the film is very, very good and would have been one of the best in the flick. Andrew kevin Walker script is excellent great directing, great acting great movie. Way better than other serial killer movies like The Bone Collector.

29 July 2007,Amazingly Satisfying!,"Have you ever came out of a theater and thought, ""Man that movie was a complete piece of sh**. It had a terrible plot, no excitement, and a under satisfying ending."" Well this movie will give you a complete opposite reaction. First off it is brilliant how the murderer in the film kills people. He works by referring to the 7 deadly sins. Second off, even at points of the film when things happen and you think that you might know how this movie will end, you are completely blown off your feet. I was so shocked about how this thriller ended, I couldn't help but spoil the ending to many off my friends. Even the acting in this film was terrific, specially by Brad Pitt. I hardly like any of the other films that Brad Pitt has been in, but this role was terrific. If there is one movie that you have not seen and want to pick up the next time you go to the rental store, i suggest se7en. *Caution get ready to pee your pants from the ending*

I just became the living definition of what is wrong with user ratings.

20 April 1999,One of the best movies ever created.,"My expectation of Se7en wasn't that big. Maybe that's why i loved it that much. The actors are fantastic, the plot scary, and both the music and directing tops the best X- files episode. This one even gets on top of ''The silence of the lambs'' ( even though the copying from that movie is pretty obvious ). It got me in about the same way as Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It was dark and disgusting. I mean, just the idea of getting a big fat man eat himself to death makes anyone land on your knees and throw up. The city is as dark and rainy as in ''Blade Runner'' and ''The Crow'', the plot at least as good as in Silence of the lambs, and none of the actors have made a better performance than they did in this movie. The best of them was of course Kevin Spacey. This movie is going up to number 4 on my favorite movie-list. I don't think i can describe it any further. Go and watch Se7en now. If you dare that is.

30 July 2021,i love this movie,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10
19 November 2001,One of the best horror/mystery film ever made,"This is a film that will scare you and will be in the back of your mind forever. I loved this movie for it's creepy effect. It is in the vain of such mentally challenging and scary features as Angel Heart and The Changeling. What really makes this film is it's use of a mystifying story line. Even though the killer is eventually found, the mystery doesn't stop there. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and R. Lee Ermey among others round out a very good line-up. Pitt is good as the foul-mouthed young detective Mills. Freeman is awesome as the aging and wisdom-filled detective Somerset. The choice of villain is an especially nice touch but telling would break a great story. Overall, David Fincher exceeded all expectations for this film and that is possibly the main reason it is a classic.

10 out of 10. Try to watch this movie with the lights out.

18 September 2004,Fincher does it again,"Seven is a movie about two detectives, played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who notice that their killer has been following a theme: the Seven Deadly Sins. Fincher turns an average premise into one of the best films of the nineties, an engrossing, fascinating and even apocalyptic thriller. There are some great ideas about human nature, and while it doesn't go as deep as Fight Club, the ending is a shocker. Kevin Spacey shows up during the last half hour to give another great performance, and even R. Lee Ermey features in some scenes. Highly recommended. 9/10

23 February 2000,"Nice concept, too many holes","Se7en was an interesting concept, i loved the idea. Too bad David Fincher occasionally leaves out a little thing called logic. Too many plot holes, unanswered questions and preposterous character choices all around. This could have been a masterpiece, instead, it's just another movie you've seen before and it wasn't that good the first time.

3 May 1999,"Director David Fincher studies the limits of the cruelty and the human's degradation, through an implacable hunt for a serial killer!!","A pretty and vain woman is tied in a bed and she has her face rip up with a razor. An obese man is forced to eat till his stomach explodes. A corrupt and greedy lawyer has part of his belly pulled up and he is forced to eat it. These are just some of the rudest scenes of a violent and morbid film that was filmed in 1995 and attracted a lot of people around the whole world to the box offices, but it also created plenty of polemic. The film is already one of the best thrillers done and it follows the noir style, generating,this way,an almost unbearable sensation of mystery, tension and fear, but at the same time attractive. The story of the film is intriguing and touching: detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) is sent to a new policemen's division in a violent metropolis (one of the great ideas of the plot is exactly not to mention in any moment the name of the city nor the year in which the story happens, making the show here more mysterious and intriguing ) and he has to team up with detective Sommerset (Morgan Freeman). It is obvious, from the first encounter among them,that the two don't understand each other and they don't like each other,but when a brutal series of murders begin to happen, following the seven capital sins, they are found in a situation in that they can either get join to hunt the violent serial killer or they won't be able to do nothing to stop the brutal crimes that are scaring the whole press around the world. And starting from that interesting and well-armed story several memorable and unforgettable scenes will happen, as the persecution in a full street, the talking and the thrill feeling between Tracy (Gwyneth Palthrow), the woman of Mills, and Sommerset in a restaurant, and the final climax that without a doubt is consecrated as the most shocking scene of film's history, and surprisingly this scene doesn't show anything concrete, but it suggests, what still turns everything more unbearable. ""Seven"" is an excellent film, a masterpiece directed with effectiveness by director David Fincher, who gets to ally a good plot and good sceneries (that explore the whole degrading aspect of the city: the homosexuals, the prostitutes, the drug addicts) with the exquisite Darius Khondji's picture, that certainly reaches the excellence level that, for example, Vilmos Szigmond got in ""Deliverance"". The only problem of ""Seven"", that impedes it of consecrating itself as an absolute classic of the generô and to reign in the gallery in where the master Hitchcock's films are, resides in the fact that the film ""gives away too soon"" the identity of the murderer. If perhaps the identity was surprising the film would have shocked more, and it would become better. Even so ""Seven"" failed in that point, where it lacked more courage of the excellent film director David Fincher, but it achieved it's goal in many, many other points. But my analysis on the film only makes me to recommend it, and if you want yourself to be a part a without- truces and breath-taking hunt,rent this film now!!!

""Seven"" is Rated R for grisly afterviews of horrific and bizarre killings, and for strong language; and it runs 123 minutes. The Cast: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Palthrow and John C. McGinley.",
31 May 2011,"Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Pride, Lust and Envy","At the start of Se7en, we get to see a murder scene happening in the beginning of an investigation. The detectives are played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. What they don't know is that the next seven days are going to be a rude awakening by a series of unfortunate murders. Se7en has a great and smart idea and a great pacing of suspense. But, sometimes the movie is hard to watch because of the graphic violence being displaced. After the beginning of the movie, the detectives are assigned to solve the murder cases. They have a similar connection, all of the cases is marked with the seven deadly sins. Soon, they realize that a menacing serial killer is on the loose. The setting for Se7en really concentrates on a dark, quite scary atmosphere. We don't know where the story takes place, but that means anything big in the plot because this movie holds the full package. Se7en keeps a dark and grim tone to the murders. This is a full exceptional cast also including R. Lee Ermey and Gwyneth Paltrow. Se7en works at its best with all of the suspenseful scenes and it pulls off with a edge-of-your-seat climax. A great mystery thriller. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars",8

4 November 2006,Se7en manifests itself as a masterpiece in every aspect.,"A succession of atrocities are perpetuated by a sacrosanct and ingenious yet lethal antagonist. These atrocities are associated with the seven sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, wrath, greed and sloth. By illustrating a stunning depiction of the seven sins in virulent, grotesque and disturbing scenes the serial murderer (Kevin Spacey) expounds his actions as a trivial facilitation towards the cleanliness of an already corrupted and evil society.

Intent on pursuing justice and alleviating their own curiosities, Detective Lt. William Somerset (who at first stipulates his leave after 20 years in the force) and David Mills (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt)are presented with an array of misguided and inconclusive pieces, amalgamated by the killer himself. As the clues build further and further, Detective Lt. Somerset sustains a consistent methodical approach (although periodically vagued by a contradicting whim to retire) to the deciphering of these enigmas, but the impetuous David Mills aspires for instantaneous results. Finally, when both have practically given up hope for lost, the unexpected occurs, and an alarming twist of events which keeps the viewers on their seats unfold.",
26 May 2022,Very good,"This is a great psychological thriller. David fincher is my favorite director of all time (or Alfred Hitchcock). There are several really disturbing scenes (lust and sloth scene). This is WAY darker than silence of the lambs. The last act is the best final act of any movie. This movie not have such a high rating if not for the terrific finale.

17 February 2019,One of Spacey's Most Captivating Performances,"There's a bleak murkiness that shrouds each scene of this grim tale in an atmosphere of mystery and dark intrigue, from the nigh unimaginable brutality of its murders to the disturbing layers of the pshyches of its characters. Thematically it plays to the tormented morality of Spacey's John Doe, exploring the immortality of infamy within the morbid echo-chamber of his mind without the need for the typically misplaced sense of self-righteousness usually found in villains of his calibur.

27 January 1999,extremely disturbing film,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

22 September 2012,An Epic on Crime & Detection,"Se7ven is a classical movie on crime and detection. The film moves around two detectives; one seasoned and one novice. They are on a mutual assignment to investigate and arrest a heinous serial killer involved in torturing and murdering people. The story is excellently written by Andrew Kevin Walker; depicts great home work on plot, might involve review after review by him before finalization, in depth psyche of all characters and order of happening of events in an ascending order of gravity. The psyche of the killer was greatly conceived. There are a number of films on torturing and serial killing but it was a unique idea that what paradoxical impact one can perceive from great writings of Dante! It's a genuine thinking of writer and super cinematography by the director. Acting of Morgan Freeman is splendid. He has the god given talent of absorbing into characters created for him. His dressing however resembles to ""Columbo"" somehow. Brad Pitt was great except in last scene when he was double minded; his hesitance was understandable but acing was not that great as it was in whole film. Viewers' interest, suspense and mystery of the film lasts until the last scene as nobody was suspecting what actually happened; again full marks to writer and director. This movie is up to the level of Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock and we have David Fincher; an Alfred Hitchcock in pipeline. This is the movie of the Director David Fincher. He is the captain of the ship and knows how to set sail, where to speed up, where to show emotions..... all is excellent. The choices of sets and locations are great. The direction is simply magnificent. Special effects and Sound is impressive. The music by Howard Shore is inspiring, striking and exciting. The music plays a very important role in the epic.",10
7 October 2000,My 2nd Favorite Serial Killer Movie. (Some Spoilege),"I have seen my fair share of serial killer movies. And of the ones I've seen, none of them hold a candle to The Silence of the Lambs.... Except Seven (or Se7en). We all know that Lambs is the greatest of all killer movies, and nothing can top it, ever. But Seven is most defiantly worthy of a second spot. I love the plot, the acting (who doesn't love Morgan Freeman?), and not to mention David Fincher's great directing. I'm not a big fan of Brad Pitt, but he's better in this movie than most movies I've seen him in.

While this movie really isn't for the faint at heart, it is in no way a gory movie. Fincher avoids many grotesque images by showing the facial reactions of the actors looking at the serial killer's work.

And the acting, oh the acting. (SPOILING STARTING!) Keven Spacey is soooo creepy as John Doe. Not Hannibal creepy, but creepy none the less. Morgan Freeman shines above them all, being the great man that he is. Many famous actors are in this movie with little parts. Richard Roundtree (yes, Shaft) is in this, but only for a second or two. Gwyneth Paltrow is in this movie, but I can't stand her. She is such a little bitch (excuse my language, but she is). I almost laughed at the very end (those of you who have seen the movie know what I'm talkin about). But despite the fact I don't like her, she does a good job in his movie.

The thing I love about the plot is it is so untraditional. Most serial killer movies have the killer turn out to be a best friend of the good guy or even a fellow detective. Not this movie. Also, I love the realism. Like I said before, this is no Silence of the Lambs, not even in the realism department. But it's still sooo good anyway.

Some people might not like this movie and consider it to be a traditional Hollywood Scream movie, but give it a chance. This is a great find.",10
9 August 2023,What's in the box?,"Here I go on my mission to find the seven deadly sins in this David Fincher mystery crime thriller, Se7en. It focuses on dark and brutal themes of mystery and horror and it has that very evocative story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat whilst Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are witnessing the horrors of the seven deadly sins, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Whoever uses those sins as motives in murders is John Doe and he cut his own fingertips so that the police and two detectives, David Mills and William Somerset won't know who killed these victims but Mills and Somerset do know it's John Doe who committed these horrible crimes. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry together on-screen to have the mystery to solve the seven deadly sins in this creepy cruel world where sins and crimes are committed including in bad weather 'cause the filmmakers wanted to make the atmosphere look gritty and dark. David Fincher has his reputation for making his films and cinematography look gritty, brutal and dark as I said in his previous films. The twist at the end is brutal, it's amazing. The box has something inside and Mills know that someone's head is inside and he says that one line that everyone knows about is ""What's in the box?"" and he has the great chase scene between him and Doe. Both of these scenes are suspenceful. I love Se7en and Se7en is an brutal and dark edge of the seat neo-noir crime thriller that will keep you invested for some mystery and thrills by David Fincher. There is another films that stars Brad Pitt and directed by David Fincher is Fight Club and I am interested in checking it out because of David Fincher's directing style and cinematography. If anybody hasn't seen Se7en, I would recommend you go watch it and if anybody who hates the film, they are totally sinned. I know that's just a catchphrase but that's just the way it is for people who hated Se7en.",9

25 October 2021,Human nature,"Somerset: ""If we do catch him, and find he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations . . . But he's not the devil, he's just a man."" Small wonder Somerset didn't want to bring his erstwhile partner's child into such a world. Few actors could carry across the moral burden and torment of such reasoning, yet Freeman (his name a dark history unto itself) achieves it without effort. His is not cheap cynicism, the easy quip that peppers so many movies that offer slick dialogues. The screenplay writer Walker seems almost to have tailored the script to Morgan's natural gravitas, and it fits the actor to a tee. The man he plays is weary, not cynical: ""I don't think I could continue to live in a place the nurtures apathy as if it were a virtue."" His slow-burning bromance with Mills is nicely handled (and ends in an oblique declaration of love). Meanwhile, Somerset and Doe are like two sides of the same coin, in sync with their analysis of the world's horrors, one believing he might stem the slaughter, the other intent on provoking an uprising against evil. Note that Somerset does not consider Doe deranged at all, just evil claiming to purge evil. He has a point: the bulk of that book held sacred by Christians is a catalogue of vengeance and spite, rape and pillage. In the closing scene out in the desert: ""What d'you got?"" barks Mills. ""Dead dog,"" replies Somerset calmly (flies buzzing). ""I didn't do that,"" is Doe's response, one of the most sublimely camp lines in American cinema. Despite the sterling performances onscreen (bar the petulant Pitt largely playing himself), the true stars is the invisible screenwriter Walker. Fincher does his job, and so he should.",9
22 June 2003,"Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and the Seven Deadly Sins.","What a gem of a movie this is? SE7EN is one of the most intense thrillers ever made.

With a teriffic cast, a well-written script and lots of substance, SE7EN works in very many ways and never misses.

10 November 2019,"Ernest Hemingway once wrote, ""The world is a fine place and worth fighting for."" I agree with the second part.","What to say about this movie? It's a masterpiece. Period.

Se7en is very well crafted, skillfully written (Andrew Kevin Walker) and directed (David Fincher), starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow. This movie is about two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his motives. The creation of suspense and terror in this movie is amazing, it keeps you with the same information that the detectives have and you keep up the investigation.

A film about two homicide detectives' (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) desperate hunt for a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the world's ignorance of the Seven Deadly Sins. The movie takes us from the tortured remains of one victim to the next as the sociopathic ""John Doe"" sermonizes to Detectives Somerset and Mills -- one sin at a time. The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and subdued tones characteristic of film noir. The seasoned and cultured but jaded Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...

It amazingly well constructed with great dialogue between characters and the acting of the ""John Doe"" is amazing. The dark construction and design is perfection. The soundtrack also is very good.

This movie enters in my top 50 movies of all time for sure. Its worth every second. Bravo",10

16 August 2021,"As the definitive ""serial killer"" film, it surpasses Silence of The Lambs, and sits just below Psycho.","A film of such craft and attention to detail, it reminds me of an ornate Chinese puzzle box. Each segment fits perfectly into the others, but only reveals deeper complexity. As Morgan Freeman's character so aptly states, ""even the best clues only lead to others."" In any case, the final clue is about as subtle as having that puzzle box explode in your hand leaving you astonished to be looking at a bloody stump where your hand used to be.

12 June 2006,The Prince of Darkness,"When I first saw Se7en, I thought it was reasonable. Then, reading the endless comments on IMDb that held it up as some sort of masterpiece, I became frustrated with people thinking that just because it is a well put together serial killer film, it is a masterpiece. Yet of late, I have realised, that Se7en is not a serial killer film. Not just that, anyway.

Se7en is an idea, a statement (if you're as pessimistic as that) about the world we live in. There is not a single moment in this film that does not scream ""The world is a horrible place."" Personally I don't agree that that is true, but that doesn't make the notion of the film any less masterful. So, it is since I have realised that Se7en is not about a killer, but a horrible notion, that yes, it is a masterpiece. Whether you enjoy it or not, is a different story. But if you have not yet seen it, whilst you're watching it - consider Somerset's (Morgan Freeman) point of view, and consider how the film expresses it.

There are some brilliant dark films out there - but I consider Se7en to be the darkest (and one of the best) of them all - hence the title of this review, The Prince of Darkness.",8
7 December 2009,SE7EN could even be a great silent film,"I watched this disc with the isolated score track, so that's why I wrote a summary out of left field. I'm a David Fincher nut and if he directed the Yellow Pages, I'd be there waiting to see it. (In an amusing analogy, Samuel L. Jackson was on a talk show over a decade ago, I think it was ""Vibe"", and he read out loud from those pages and it was great!)

So when Fincher, who's one of the few to earn the right to be called visionary, makes a movie, it's an event. ""SE7EN"" is full of vile images, depraved people and an outright hideous aura of urban hell. The desire to help, if you could call what homicide detectives work at help, is at the core of this sin in seven parts picture.

Morgan Freeman is such a commanding actor, you'd believe him in just about any part. Here he is, tired, ready to exit the blood soaked carpet of police work, even if his soul will never truly let him walk away from it. He'd be in his den, looking at crime scene photos from some long ago unsolved mystery and put in triple overtime in the unpaid retired police department.

Brad Pitt's character can stand to learn a lot from his senior partner, but he can't settle down or wait unless he absolutely has to. His impetuousness almost gets them in over their heads and John Doe (played by you know who) enjoys the sick game he unfurls like some epic serialized saga from the bowels of hell. Pitt and the mystery man are on a collision course and something has got to give.

This film is so rich visually and it's bizarre to call a tour of the evil human soul yanked out for all to witness ""rich"". Try to forget any shot you've ever seen from a Fincher picture and it's pretty much impossible. The man's style is like the old masters painting on celluloid.

""SE7EN"" is best appreciated after a while without having watched it, at least that's how I approach the repeated views. Andrew Walker gave us a script which pretty much is the best fictional interpreting of a madman's mind. I doubt anyone will come up with anything more devilishly clever.",10
12 April 2007,"""Se7en"" Takes The Viewer Inside A World Relentlessly Threatened By Danger. An Indisputable Example Of A Modern Masterpiece","Back in '95 David Fincher released a film named Se7en, following his cruelly underrated '93 box-office-disaster Alien3 (view the director's cut and you might understand what I mean). In the sense of the American film industry, Se7en was the film which established Fincher's talent and from there on in he had more freedom on the films he wanted to create.

Se7en is a dark tale of morality, depicting two cops who both find themselves stuck inside a deadly game. One of the cops is Sommerset (Morgan Freeman), a man planning to retire from the job and the environment of which he deems unfit and too bleak to live in, a place where he believes ""apathy"" is welcomed. The other cop, Mills (Brad Pitt) has recently required his detective badge and has moved to the city of Chicago to help bring ""light"" to the city, while building a ""hero"" reputation. Both detectives have different views on the squalid world they are surrounded by and both use different methods when performing a task. The detectives soon find themselves obsessed with capturing a vicious criminal who is terrifying the area with bizarre ""deadly sins"" killings and leaving puzzling and mostly unusable evidence at the scene of the crimes.

The narrative which Se7en follows is one that is structured with such precision that you become apart of the film. The viewer becomes grasped by the story's compelling nature and the manipulative unanswered questions. Yet, here lies one of the few faults with Se7en, this being the film's tendency to lose the connectivity of scenes. At times this can detract the viewer, while also making subplots feel cut-off and halted abruptly. Although, this is not too significantly noticeable, it is still there and something which stops the film deserving a definitive ""masterpiece"" status.

The film still surges with its constant excitement and attention to detail, making it a film of such finesse that it remarkably works as a delicate counter-piece to the horrific story being told. I consider the pivotal scene in Se7en to be the chase scene, the scene whereby the viewer captures their first glimpse of John Doe (with the exclusion of the infamous opening-credits). It is a scene where my adrenaline started pumping, a scene so expertly thought out with such visceral realism, taking the characters to their most primitive of instincts. This is where the set-pieces come in; the set-pieces in Se7en are built with glaring authenticity and unsettling detail, retaining the disturbing exuberance the film follows.

Se7en is a film that goes leaps and bounds for the modern ""cops vs. criminals"" genre; it provides a level of rarely matched excitement and adrenaline-pumping emotion. It is a film so genuine that by the end of the film you will have built up a bond with the two protagonists. It is remarkable just how exact and precise the film is in its style, atmospherically edited (with the exception of the connectivity) and wonderfully layered offering much analysis for the viewer. One of the film's optimum features are the multi-dimensional characters, the characters of Se7en are ones who you care for and are characters who have robust personality to study. It is impossible not to adore the film's appetite for its characters, such as the clashing viewpoints, offering the viewer to make their own personal judgement and also the character's reactions to the repulsive behaviour which has engulfed the city. All this is due to how astonishingly rigorous and convincing the performances are, the actors all develop their own persona and you have to take note of the smaller details to gain a true understanding of the characters.

Se7en is a film providing sour, surfaced-toned noir to enable the merging of absorbing grittiness and ""lucid"" fantasy, etched with painful realism. The film details every dark corner, capturing a feel of vulnerability and the general taste of fear through highly alluring, yet horribly detached environments, ultimately providing a cold and painfully evocative atmosphere. The cinematography is rigorous, while still being very open in its wonderfully ""edgy"" style. The camera is fixated on the tiniest detail, capturing the emotion on the lens through the exposed characters in wide, yet horribly tight environments. The make-up is just another example of the laborious amount of time and pre-development which was spent on creating the film's ""gothic fairytale"" manner. Even with all the technical brilliance, it is still the acting which remains the film's finest feature.

More importantly than anything Se7en remains one of the finest films in its genre, providing a relief from your typically simplistic Hollywood film. Instead the film offers a depressing morality tale which motivates the viewer into thinking about what will occur next and giving you taste of the horrific crimes detectives become obsessed with solving. Ultimately, few films can succeed in gripping you as much as the inexplicable brilliance of Se7en.",8
15 December 2013,Great movie!,"I watched Se7en, which stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey and I was gob smacked at how well crafted the storyline and ending are. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are searching for a man only known as 'John Doe,' he is killing and preaching at the same time by killing people based on the Seven Deadly sins, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Greed, Lust, Wrath and Pride as his motive. Somerset takes this case as his last one before he calls it the quits and Mills is a new detective, who doesn't usually listen to the much more experienced Somerset. The story unfolds with the detectives trying to track this killer after he is toying with the police leaving no fingerprints and hardly any clues of any kind. I won't tell anymore but there's not many dull moments and the ending is like no other I've ever seen. From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over. Very Highly recommended and I would give it 9/10.

14 April 2021,Se7en,"Once upon a time Kevin Spacey was as versatile and talented and respected as the likes of Gary Oldman and other top tier character actors. This movie is one of the reasons why. Such a good, suspenseful, and twisted plot. Really good if you can get past Spacey's real life transgressions to watch it.

29 January 2006,Groundbreaking,"Sure, this was a groundbreaking movie, sicker than anything before, regret I actually saw this at a movie theater. Doesn't happen to often, and when it finally happens, it's rubbish like this. Hardly what the world needs...

Photo like a flickering rock video, shadows, bad light and rain. Uou often miss what's happening on the screen because of this, but after-wards, you're glad you did. Morgan Freeman is really good most of the time, but this makes me wonder.

Doesn't really need more reviews, just a movie that made the world a worse place, that's what it did to me but unfortunately it seems to have far greater voting points that I could dream of.

29 November 2014,Lavishly disturbing,"Watched in film studies; loved the plot, liked the characters apart from the barely there wife. I mean, come on, they gave everyone else a personality... Morgan freeman was absolutely wonderful, and this film makes his current typecasting painful; with the depth and range of his performance. Brad Pitt did a good, but not remarkable job as well. The villain, John Doe, of course stole the show; and every single death was an exhibitionist delight to watch, gripping the part of you that likes to be disturbed by the throat, refusing to let go. The visuals were lavishly disturbing and the soundtrack worked wonderfully - however, the last death(s) was bloody obvious, and this was hell to watch for someone who thinks of herself as squeamish. I managed to man up and watch every death scene apart from the last one; in which the film turned into a radio programme instead and I was intensely fascinated with the minutiae of the floor.

5 April 1999,"Dark, depressing, captivating, thrilling","1995 was the best year for movies since the 1970s. Think about it: ""Clockers"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Heat"", ""Seven"", ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" all came out that year. Even the Academy Award picked films were top-drawer: ""Braveheart"", ""Casino"", ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Babe"", the list goes on.

In choosing the best film of the year, I keep wavering between ""Seven"", ""Heat"" and ""Clockers"". Right now I've elected ""Heat"", but ""Seven"" is close on its heals. This, to quote Roger Ebert, is filmmaking of a high order. Of all the skillfully crafted scenes and shots in the film, I will talk about two.

The opening scene is wonderful--it's not a car chase, it's Morgan Freeman's Detective Somerset getting ready for his last day at work. I remember the camera gazing down on his dresser, upon which is carefully arranged his ""stuff""--the things he carries around on his person on a typical day. I can't recall what the things were, exactly, I just remember what an odd, familiar feel the camera gave them. Morgan Freeman assembles his detective with care: we know before a word is spoken this is his last day on the job. His precision is reminiscent of the end of the ""Quentin"" chapter in Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury"", where Quentin does all of his day-to-day tasks, right down to brushing his teeth and inquiring about the correct time, just before.....

The other scene is the library scene. It'd be fair to say that any modern film sequence that features Bach's ""Suite No 3 in D-major, BMV 1068: Air"" might be raised to the level of classic pop art, and in this case, you'd be right. Bach is strangely appropriate here, and totally appropriate for the film. So is Trent Reznor, who contributed the music for the titles. What is the purpose of the scene? Not much, just some guys looking stuff up in the city library. Is it gloomily beautiful, sad, and memorable? Absolutely.

A few words on film music. Critics tried to tell us that ""Seven""'s soundtrack was a mish-mash of classic and modern styles, serving only as a fishing net to catch fancy of as many moviegoers' tastes as possible. Negative, ghostrider, the pattern is full. If I had to criticize ""Seven""'s music, I would say: a director like David Fincher, who clearly takes soundtrack selection seriously, is apt to inspire copycats the way Tarantino did after ""Pulp Fiction"". Fresh film school graduates who imagine they possess eclectic tastes (""yeah, I listen to Mozart and Metallica and all that"") will inevitably be inspired to try and duplicate Fincher's scoring. It can't be done: movies aren't just clotheslines for catchy pop tunes and the random selection from ""Classical Music For Dummies"". Anyone who studies film will agree with me when I say that the music, like the cinematography, must suit the story and the scene, not the other way around.

To sum up, ""Seven"" is a first-rate detective story, the best since ""Kiss Me Deadly"". Performances, photography, Oscar-nominated editing, and (of course) music are all tops.",
15 August 1999,One of the best movies of the 90s,"I can´t believe I haven´t commented on this film earlier. This is filmmaking of the highest order. A superb script wonderfully realized. I hope Fincher can maintain the high standards he has set for himself here. A future filmmaker can learn a lot from this movie, just in terms of pacing. The way it shifts into high gear is masterful, and it´s refreshing to find a director nowadays who knows when and how to move the camera for maximum dramatic effect. Howard Shore´s fine score is unobtrusive and used only when needed. Photography, editing, acting- top notch, and I thought Brad Pitt was just a Hollywood pretty boy, how wrong was I? I understand the producers wanted a more upbeat ending, and that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt deserves credit for helping Fincher convince them not to change anything. As we approach the end of the millenium, this is one movie who stands tall above the vast sea of forgettable Hollywood movies of the 90s.

29 April 2000,7en,"Highest rank in movie originality. The artworks are brilliant. From the Covers, concepts, credits title, imposed, to the crime artworks. Morgan Freeman is as cool and fatherly as usual, and Brad Pitt is as childish and stunnIng as he suppose to be. And Gwyneth can easily get people Sympathy. And who's the winner? Yes. The Killer himself. Mr. John Doe (by choice). Very dramatic atmospheres, gripping tales, and sensational climax. Please don't think of this as a mystery movie because there's no big mystery to be solved here. Just a story about old and new cops and how they're dealing their First case together. But other than that, it's deserves more than just se7en mark.

27 December 2003,Not for the faint of heart,"There are some genuinely shocking scenes in this movie which made it tough to want to go back and view it again. Unfortunately this film deserves more than one viewing so I was compelled to do so. A very good story with non-intrusive yet moody soundtrack. The chemistry between the main characters stays interesting without becoming a cliche 'buddy' movie. Excellent camera work. I could find very little to complain about in this movie except that it puts me in a bad mood. I wanted to personally gut the villain myself by the end of the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who can handle intense and gruesome. Keep this one away from the kids and grandma.

9 January 2004,Huh? This would make a great 30 minute short.,"I can't believe this movie has nine stars. Is the ratings-system rigged?

This is far from a terrible movie. Kevin Spacey is excellent, as always, but he's not in much of the movie. The rest of the acting is passable at best. This isn't anyone's fault except the screenwriter, as the dialog is about as boring as it is possible to imagine. REALLY bad.

The only thing that makes this movie work is the grizzlyness of the murders. -Well, and the very ending is excellent.

That's not a whole lot to build 2 hours on. Everything in-between drags on at a glacial pace. Odd, too, as I think that two of Fincher's other films (Fight Club and The Game) are amazing. classic, even.

Mind you, I am a big fan of this TYPE of movie, but this one just falls flat and bores me to death. Good movies of this genre tend to draw the viewer into the puzzle, and force you to try to figure things out for yourself. In this movie, all you can do is wait for the answer to be revealed.

Maybe you'll love it, obviously a lot of people did (or else the IMDB got paid to rig the stars-rating) -but I can't really recommend this movie on any level.

I'll give it 3 stars. Without the great ending I'd give it ONE star.",
12 September 2019,Best ending for a modern thriller.,"The desert scene and the parcel delivered to Freeman's character.... nice and more original than most garbage I have seen in other murder/police thrillers.

4 December 2019,"Engaging, fascinating, impactful","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

3 September 2023,A movie I can't wait to share with my children when they grow up.,"Se7en is on of those movies that no matter how old it gets will still be one of the greats. It has all the necessary story elements to make for a great movie of this type.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are a duo that I wish would be in more movies together. The way these two portray their characters, one a new impatient detective and one who just wants to make it through the day to retire at some point in time while still having the push to do things the right way is a perfect match for these two greats.

I have seen this movie atleast 30 times and it's always fantastic and that twist at the end brings back the same emotions every single time.

This is well placed in the top 10 movies of all time on IMDB and should remain there until someone else can top it with a masterpiece better than this. The day that comes I will be in forever amazement.",10

2 July 2017,Shockingly good...,"There are very few films which are truly shocking, brilliant and moving all at once, Se7en is one such rare case. In my brief movie invested life, Se7en is only one of two films I would consider a masterpiece. David Fincher is my favourite director, and Brad Pitt my favourite actor, and this film is the reason I had begun to take note of the two. Fincher's direction is immaculate and Andrew Kevin Walker's script is unbelievably good.

Characters: William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a retiring detective, and he embodies so perfectly - silent intelligence, as opposed to the boyish aggression of his partner, the rookie David Mills (Brad Pitt) despite his claims of experience. Both attempt to uncover a truly mesmerising case in which the killer carries out murders based on the seven deadly sins. Somerset is deeply reluctant of his surrounding, whereas Mills seems to feed off of it, and their partnership brings across the subtle and brash attempt of uncovering a mystery respectively. Walker's script expertly devotes time through dialogue and minor actions to bring across the complexities of the two different characters and their different mindsets, whether it's their differing opinion on the killer, environment, or even how 50 bucks is spent.

Story & Direction: As far as murder mysteries go, there are no better than Se7en, its script so clever, horrifying and unique. It brings a sense of realism through the characters who live in such a wore down and dismal setting. Each murder is horrific, yet as they pass, the audience become further eager to discover the killer as well as becoming further unsettled. And it is without any hesitation that I can say that Se7en has the greatest ending of all time, the plot builds up sensationally, with a dark and sinister tone and the finish is so unbelievably satisfying. Upon rewatches, the film only gets better. Fincher's unique style only adds to the tension and disturbing nature of scenes.

Acting: Morgan Freeman as ever, gives a nuanced performance. His portrayal of Somerset as having come to terms with the ugliness of reality is impeccable. Brad Pitt similarly does a great job of acting as the inexperienced, arrogant and angry rookie, trying to make do of his environment. The acting is top notch throughout, as murders unravel, the shock of it all is brought across expertly through the sheer quality of acting, and Fincher relies on this, as opposed to clichéd flashbacks.

Verdict: i've seen many mystery films, and none come close to Fincher's masterpiece. It's dark, gripping and undeniably shocking. It's one of two films I have given the perfect 10/10. It's a must see.",10
6 March 1999,"So scary, I couldn't watch some of it!","If you want a movie that is smart and horrifying, this is the movie for you. I can watch a vampire movie and not be scared, but this is a different story. The scenes of murder are so grisly that I couldn't even watch some of it. The ending I will never forget, though...terrific and realistic! One of Morgan Freeman's best! Kevin Spacey was also good in his small but crucial role!

23 February 2006,Way over-hyped,"This movie is one of the most over-hyped I've ever seen (#43 in IMDb!). Seeing the trailer let one know (and guess) at least 60% of the movie, the end is more or less clear about 20 minutes before it happens and absolutely clear about 5 minutes.

This brings me to another point: the plot fills this more-than-2-hour-movie as Brad Pitt would fill the clothes of the Gluttony-victim. There are too many sequences that seem just stretched and which do nothing for plot or character development.

All in all: could've been a decent 90-minute movie, and I've seen many worse but it's definitely not worth more than 5 points. I gave it 4 (-1 for being over-hyped).

15 January 2021,6ix,"A veteran detective delays his retirement to usher in an ambitious hero.

Brad Pitt's delightful dimples make him a target for methodical serial killer John Doe. Morgan Freeman provides the only sanctuary for Pitt's character Detective David Mills because, we know Mills is ""not from here"". Here being, an unknown American inner city where police sirens howl and gunshots echo throughout, the night. Freeman's character, Detective Somerset agrees to help Mills because, he makes a connection between the two murder cases they are each assigned. Seven is a compulsive fetish of a film that you cannot turn away from. Are we sinners for enjoying this film? Macho hero Mills refuses to accept the city is forsaken and pays the painful price. Se7en remains a favourite movie from the 1990's for anyone of that generation. It is an ensemble of talented performers, heart pounding narrative action and of course the moody, noir city..

16 August 2001,"""We see a sin on every Street corner, and we tolerate it""","Okay, I'm sick of this whole, ""style over substance"" thing that everybody is talking about. What are you trying to imply, that the film was made without a script - that they made it up as they went along... It seems critics don't take the time to decide why they hate films anymore, it's a lot easier to say ""style over substance"", film is a visual medium for heavens sake. No other director has take the amount of flack for this than David Fincher, he's every critics whipping boy - and why, because he began his career making music videos, because he made Alien 3 and it failed to live up to ""lord"" Cameron's Aliens (1986)... It's just plain laziness - for god's sake take the time to analyse the film before you write it off as a failure.

Now onto the film. Se7en is basically the buddy cop movie, except the cops in question aren't really buddies... It's also a serial killer movie, but it has the guts to break every rule about serial killer movies you thought you knew. I love the questions this film raises, and if you're one of the people who I was addressing at the start of this review you'll probably be scratching you're heads - but yes, this film has a powerful message.

Se7en deals with society, it deals with something that we see everyday but most of us turn our backs to it. You only have to open a news paper and you'll see a list of terrible atrocities that have befallen people, horrendous things happening everyday, and we just turn our backs, in the words of John Doe (Kevin Spacey - and yes I got my I.D. from his character) ""we see a sin on every street corner, and we tolerate it, we tolerate it because it's common""... Every word delivered by Doe is of importance, it should sound clichéd but Spacey's delivery is so great that it becomes truthful, he say's later on, after describing why he chose to kill who he killed (Only in a world this sh*ty, can you say these people are innocent and keep a straight face""... This is all serious stuff, and I think one of the reasons people dismiss the film is because these are issues that they are not ready to face.

As everyone knows and comments on, is that Fincher is one of the most visually talented directors working today, and despite what people have said the gloomy low-key lighting and constant rain work brilliantly, creating an atmosphere, I must also point out Fincher's use of sound design, he and the sound engineer Ren Klyce evoke a sense of urban detachment whenever they can, the scenes with Summerset (Morgan Freeman) in his apartment, the violent domestic arguments audible in the other rooms. All of this is not Fincher trying to say, ""Hey look how clever I am"" but to draw the audience in. He needs those shadows to create suspense, to distract the eye of the viewer to something else, to lure them into relaxation.

Yet still so many people have a problem with this film, they overlook the fact that it is a gripping detective thriller, or that the characters are 100% believable... There too concerned with what they call the sadistic gruesomeness that Fincher revels in. Well excuse me, but I though this was an adult film, this could have been a whole lot more violent, the murders are implied, you see only the after effects... If you have a problem with having to imagine things in films, then stop going to see R rated movies, stick to the family films.

There's so much more I want to say about this film, I don't think it gets the credit it deserves... And to all those people who have called it depressing - yes it is and so it should be, the world is not all sugar sprinkles and candy canes... And thank you to Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker for giving us something a little darker, for as Summerset states at the end of the film... ""Ernest Hemmingway once wrote, the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for - I agree with the second half""...

9 December 2021,"Trashy then, trashy now. Fincher as Frat-Boy Philosopher","I haven't seen this movie in 30 years. I hated it then and I hate it now. ""Seven"" is completely of its time and somehow precludes it. There is a winking one-upsmanship in the gore and conventional plotting that brings into sharp focus the gaping plot holes and (even then) familiar tropes of the serial killer fetish. Moreover, thirty years later it seems like little more than a music video version of ""Silence of the Lambs"". Pitt, as a character, displays none of the intelligence his ambitious cop is supposed to contain, a problem made more glaring by the grating, doe-eyed plot device that is Paltrow. The role is practically the only feminine presence in the film - a theme more common to Fincher's work than anyone will admit - and is platformed as a prop with which the script can unload its perversities. And at its core, ""Seven"" is just a collection of perversities. One gathers from the busy logic of the English-major screenplay that Andrew Kevin Walker himself has only read the Cliff's Notes of Classic Literature. As the reluctant team becomes more enmeshed in the killer's kink, the crimes themselves become less interesting and more obvious, as if the writer and his bad-boy director decidedly front-loaded their queasiest material to ensure that the audience was casually shocked enough to not ask many questions...like where is this movie set (it rains in every scene) and why the FBI isn't involved the very second a high-ranking public official is ritualistically murdered? The film is so intent on sticking its landing that all of the plot just becomes a wash of cartoonish sadism and lots of blank stares from Morgan Freeman, who seems to be on autopilot here, mainly because once he delivers his grizzled cop lines he has little else to act out.

The amateurish playfulness of Fincher seems especially shocking when compared to the version of the cerebral crank we have now - the kind of director whose vanity projects revel in specificity and icy pacing. Fincher would revisit many aspects of ""Seven"" in later, better films (the masterpiece ""Zodiac"" and the cool ""Mindhunter"") but would drop the trashier elements, all of which seem so glaring here. The film feels young and raw, however, because it has clearly been produced for and by young, raw men with a need to shock - self-serious frat boys nonetheless gathering around a keg and a candle to tell gross-out ghost stories. The movie feels laughably slight even as it scowls at the audience at every turn, as if emphasizing the viscera is the only way to inform the viewer that ""this is heavy, man.""

It's a bad movie, made even worse by its reputation as a good one.",2
25 April 2018,Outstanding achievement,"One of the best films of David Fincher and certainly the best serial killer film ever made. An absolute classic. It's also one of the best looking films out there, shot in Fincher's inimitable style. Love this film.

15 October 2000,Best Brad Pitt movie,"This is a gritty mind-bending thiller. It is by far my favorite Brad Pitt movie. The movie is about a killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a method to kill, and the two cops (played by Pitt and Freeman) who are destined to meet up with him. All of them involve turning the sin against the sinner, and ALL of the murders are pretty gruesome.

A word to the wise: DO NOT let your kids see this movie. It is without a doubt one of the most gruesome movies I have EVER seen. But, the gruesomeness of the murders just adds to the movie. The terrific acting of Brad Pitt and Moran Freeman (one of my favorite actors) just adds to the overall feel. Kevin Spacey's much talked about roll is small, but VERY good and VERY important to understand the movie.

Overall, this movie is just about the best horror/suspense movie I have seen.

23 September 2023,"""What's in the box?""","Synopsis: Two detectives hunt a serial killer who follows the seven deadly sins as his method of killing causing mind games and horror to the two detectives.

Perhaps David Fincher's best work, Se7en is also considered one of the best murder/mystery films in this whole genre. The film sets the mood and tone of a murder/mystery film epically, causing audience members to pay full attention to the story.

You can tell that using each element carefully, the film tries to set the perfect vibe and tone to bring out the best mystery/horror film ever.

The lighting and production design of the film is very obvious to be very dark and dim at most times. Creating some sort of fear to audience members as they feel trapped in this city with the serial killer case just as the two detectives are.

In addition, the cinematography snd directing comes in to support all of this. By switching to hand held cameras at times where the camera is pointing towards one of the detectives to show instability and fear. To having the camera on a still tripod when the camera is pointing at the serial killer to show how cold and calm he is.

The film's introduction to the two detectives right at the beginning of the film, gives audience members a glimpse of who exactly they are and their type of personality in such a short scene. We don't need the whole film to know them, you can just look at that scene and you will know right away. This is so brilliant and it wouldn't be possible without Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset or Bard Pitt as Detective Mills. Two actors who added too much effort to the story and vibes of the film specifically the dramatic side of it at the end of the film.

However, Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills (Detective Mills' wife), in my opinion added nothing special to the point that if she was replaced with another actress, it would've been totally fine. Her screen time was not that much which many might argue that maybe if she did have enough screen time, she would've shown her acting skills even more, I wouldn't think so. Most of her scenes were with either Brad Pitt or Morgan Freeman which in my opinion, is what saved her.

My rating is 9.5/10 REwatched on Sep. 21st 2023 Format: home TV.",9
27 September 2018,Thriller of all thrillers,"I watched this again after 20 years. Pitt and Freeman are such a potent combination. The film still makes my heart sink even after so many years. Absolute rollercoaster from start to finish.

11 January 2021,Good but not a masterpiece,"Se7en is about a veteran cop(Morgan Freeman) and a new in town cop(Brad Pitt) and how they try to catch a serial killer who kills based on the 7 sins. The city has a dark vibe to it andthe screen is pretty much dark all the time and it rains all the time who makes the movie more mysterious. The film has some very intense scenes whenever is a crime scene. Morgan Freeman is excellent as always and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt(which is bad and good at the same time) however I really liked the movie but in my opinion is not a masterpiece as people say.

3 April 2020,GREAT,"This is a film with a strong religious color, see the title, think of a similar ""seventh seal"". If bergman asks about the roots of faith and the existence of god in ""the seventh seal,"" then ""seven"" shows what the world would be like if it lost faith.The film just seems to show that human nature is corrupted and the guilty will be punished. In this way, the film has a warning message of moral exhortation, so that people may reflect on whether they are guilty or not. However, the film doesn't seem to give a clear explanation of what makes these people evil, what makes the killers unbearable and what makes them kill in the name of god. It could be a lack of faith.

15 April 2002,Murder By Numbers,"Two detectives (one retiring, one 'wet-behind-the-ears') try to find and put away a serial-killer who chooses major 'cardinal sinners' as victims. Even the strongest constitutions may be challenged... and this one's not as violent as one might guess. Director Fincher also did ""The Game,"" and ""Panic Room."" Maybe we are being desensitized to the subject matter we are exposed to in this film, but the story is telling us the dark human truths some of us would probably argue against to our very grave. The opening credits, as some of you might already know, inspired similar sequences in other films and television series (namely ""The Practice""). After watching this one, I was afraid for my very soul... and I, for the most part, consider myself an 'Angel.' God save the 'Devils.'

25 November 2004,I fell asleep during my first attempt to watch it.,"I know that many of you will probably want to strangle me for saying this, but I fell asleep during my first attempt at watching Se7en. I really tried to stay awake, but all attempts proved to be unsuccessful. I just couldn't stay interested. In order for a thriller to satisfy me, it has to have suspense and action. Se7en was lacking in both areas. I'll admit that the whole idea of incorporating the seven deadly sins into it was clever. However, the movie was not capable of holding my attention because it did not show any of the crimes as they were happening. When I watched the movie for the second time, I managed to stay awake. Once I got toward the end of the movie when ""John Doe"" was introduced, I finally understood what was so good about it. The end was definitely praiseworthy because it was the only intense part. I don't mean to bash the acting. Pitt, and Paltrow as well as the rest were superb actors. However, the overall storyline was insufficient.

11 February 2019,A dark and disturbing masterpiece,"Seven takes you on a horrifying journey with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two policemen on the hunt after a psychotic killer that change both their lives but mostly for the worst. Seven is a very depressing movie, from the first screenshot shows how dark and cold the unknown setting off the film truly is. It's not a movie for little kids, its like an evil film with violence and gruesome that honestly are more brutal then the psychological thrillers and horror movies being made in Hollywood today. It is just pure perfect film that just keeps getting better every time I watch it. Why the hell movie today has no soul anymore is a mystery to me. They just seems to me that the film being made today are just copying each other badly, but Seven deliverd something hole new and sinister to the cop genre and that's why to me its a clear 10 out off 10 points, just freakin amazing.

1 April 2020,The world is worth fighting for.,"In the movie, Kevin Spacey dedicated a great performance, and the shame he radiated was chilling. John Doe did have a kind of crazy thrill and be full of pride. But for this kind of enthusiasm and philosophy, we have to tell genius like Doe: You are a lunatic. Because, if we allow such a unique genius to let it go, many people in our human society will die. In this movie, we can appreciate the beauty of the perfect mode of noir. By appreciating the glorious movement of formalism, we determine the power of human confidence and common ethics : we dare to face evil and absurdity.

21 December 2021,Edge of the seat Fantastic,"In My 20+ years of watching movies and tv shows. I have never seen a more thrilling,edge of the seat,suspenfull but yet so satisfying scene. Thise last 10 minutes summed up the whole movie. It was a masterpiece. The score added to the chills.

14 August 2023,First Sin: Pride / Vanity.,"First, the good bits about Se7en are its cinematography, colour palette, and the ever reliable Morgan Freeman, replete with unnecessary end-narration.

His co-star, however - that's a different story.

Se7en is not a very good film. And it's aged much like Salad Cream.s. For a vignette of this just check out the schlocky film-print-like titles twinned with commercial alt-rock.

Pitt has demonstrated some good acting before (Kalifornia, 1993) and after (Fight Club, 1999). Not here. Perhaps he didn't like the simpleton character he plays, or it was too underwritten, but in any case he just doesn't sell the archetype of the basic think-later masculinity the film wants to go for.

There are lots of classic literary quotes in Se7en left by the serial killer (Kevin Spacey), but it all amounts to pretentiousness. It feels rather like the film wants to sell the idea of smartness. By appealing to people who identify with Pitt's basic-man: those who hold some kind of resentment for ""fag poetry"", but would dearly like to be in on it. This insults not only its audience (Pitt's character is not likable enough), but also those who are somewhat well-read. Moreover, the clumsy, out-of-place, Neo-noir atmosphere plods inconsequentially to the film's culmination: the part for which it is best remembered, its shock ending. The link between the detectives (Freeman and Pitt) and the serial killer becomes personal; but radically so, and conveniently near the end. Only for the sake of the film's surprise. This is why Se7ven just doesn't work on a whole. It's too contrived and not nearly as clever as it thinks it is.

Pitt actually seems like he would rather play any other character than who he is playing, sophisticated or not. In Pitt's defense, it's likely the film still wouldn't come together even without his casting. Interestingly, there are two references made to an earlier, more skilfully made piece of art of this ilk, but Silence Of The Lambs (1991), Se7en is not. Incidentally, The Last Seduction (1994), China Moon (1994), and even The Firm (1993) are more cogent nineties noirs.",5
11 February 2023,Probably the 8th time I watch this.,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10
11 October 2006,Hello Hollywood,"This is the kind of stuff somebody thinks up on the toilet. There is nothing remarkable about this film besides how disgusting it is. I can not help but think a more subtle approach would have helped this movie avoid the banality of the special effects, which seem more suited for a science fiction due to their over exaggeration.

The story is overly contrived. The director handles this movie in such a way that the narrative jerks from one scene to the next, yanking us to a punchling serving as a climax. Something so obvious and derivative is not worth watching.

Overall I felt the movie was very disengaging and fundamentally simplistic in narrative. The characters are cliché and I found the general atmosphere of the film undesirable.

Though in was not the full version of the story its still great. In the book Pitt hurt Morgan with his knife and then he was taken to the court, he served a short period as far as I remember.

22 July 2002,A nasty piece of (good) film-making.,"I have heard people comment on the sickness of this movie, calling it twisted and depraved. Well, it is. But these are only taken as compliments to the makers of this dark film. All the times while watching it that you keep telling yourself to turn it off, to get rid of this corrupt piece of trash, you are behaving exactly the way the people involved in making the movie wanted you to behave. You're supposed to envision the world and the people in it as pure Hell. Never in a film has urban life been so nightmarishly portrayed. From the dark and rainy days, to the smog and people-infested streets, down to the sick mind of the killer and the victims of society he preys on, this film sends a message out about what we value in life. Are we really happy living in a world such as this? This movie is very dark, and often depressing when it's not bordering on pure sickness. The murders here are so evil and unspeakable it's hard to imagine a human capable of doing such a thing. At times, I was appalled. Many will find this one hard to watch. In fact, if you don't, you may have more problems than the killer. But instead of being put off by it's violence and stunned by the things it dares to show us, embrace what the film is trying to say. No, it's not just showing you these twisted things for the Hell of it. It's trying to make you open your eyes and take in what's around you. This movie will force you to really take a good look at the world today, and scaring you into it is the best way possible. What's more frightening: sitting through the movie, or going out into the world when it's over? You decide. I recommend anyone that has a serious mind and likes intelligent, well-made movies that deliver more than the usual bag of tricks to see this, if you can stomach it. Next to Silence of the Lambs, it is the best crime thriller ever made.",
13 December 2001,Oh dear...,"Quite sick this movie was, i couldn't watch most of it, i spent quite a bit of my time hiding behind a pillow and when i saw/heard of the things that the killer had done... Well, lets put it this way, i was kinda SICKENED!

This was a mystery to me this movie, i couldn't understand it for the life of me, and not thru lack of trying, i don't like movies where there is just too much killing and not enuff reason, it just seems like a waste to me :(

I didn't enjoy this dispite the great performances by Morgan Freeman and also Brad Pitt, i just didn't like the whole story but i can't fault the characters in the story, they played their part v. well, if this wasn't just so sick then i'm sure that i would have enjoyed this movie abit more, but as it stands, i won't be watching this movie again as i personally would rather go top myself :(

10 June 2006,A Flawed and Ghastly Movie,"There are few words to describe how much I hate this movie. Abhorence, detestation, yech. They come close, but are not quite enough. This movie is not simply bad, it is shameful. A bad movie is just bad. The acting, story, script, or directing are flawed, sometimes all of the above (see Plan 9 from Outerspace, or any Paulie Shore film.) When one watches a bad movie, one seldom goes ""Now that could have been good, if only..."" Se7en, like its ridiculous title, is not a bad movie. It is a very bad movie. It could so easily have been a good movie that its total failure is that much more appalling. What began as an exploration of human vice and the criminal justice system soon dissolves into a god-awful mess of unbelievable ""motivations"" and idiotic scripting. What a waste of good material and fine actors. For Shame.

Morgan Freeman is the veteran cop somerset who is a week away from retirement and his replacement Mills a new detective played by Brad Pitt he moved here with is wife Tracy played by Gwyneth Paltrow and obviously the outstanding star of the movie was Kevin Spacey as John Doe the man who will use the seven deadly sins to kill people. we follow somerset and Mills as they investigate the murders and find out how to stop the killer and throughout the movie we are given moments which were tense and exciting and the ending was some world class film i have ever seen. overall i had never seen se7en and i have to say to watch it for the first time and i really enjoyed it and i would definitely watch it again and would definitely suggest it to you to watch.

7 December 2019,Shocking,"This movie is guilty of several of the seven deadly sins that the main antagonist seems to revere so greatly. Detectives Somerset and Mills are the classic idealistic rookie and grizzled veteran pairing and work together to try and catch a serial killer loose on the city. The killer, never identified, and so-called John Doe, kills those he feels represent the spirit of each of the deadly sins, starting with gluttony, and working his way down the list. The murders are brutal and grotesque, and the detectives scramble to catch up to Doe before he claims another life. The dark gritty style and content are well conveyed with the deep shadows, isolated colors, and deeply angled face shots. The dialogue was nothing special or emotionally potent, but what portions were full of emotion worked well within the ambiance of the grim, gritty, horror-filled nature of reality. I felt that the religious themes, while not revolutionary, helped establish the zealotry of John Doe.

28 May 2020,The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.,"Outstanding! One of the best thrillers ever made. Morgan Freeman deserved an Oscar for this (though he got one few years later for Million Dollar Baby). Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow are strong in supporting roles (yes, William Somerset is the obvious lead in this movie). The rest of the cast are adequate including an individual who was considered one of the best at that time (alas, after what we learned about him I don't wish to mention his name). David Fincher's best film according to me. Special mention for the editing (Richard Francis-Bruce) and cinematography (Darius Khondji).

A perverted religious killer does not even kill a chicken, but he finds a basis to carry out a creepy murder on people. What could be more terrifying than the act of being a devil alone?

4 September 2009,A film for any time period and very well made,"I had read the hype for this film and for the most part it was positive but like most people I wanted to see it for myself. I was not disappointed because for me it is a story which could be told in any time period. The three main characters for me were perfectly drawn and in some ways you could describe the film as the good the bad and the ugly 1995. These are the three characters you would probably see if the film was made fifty years ago or in fifty years from now. All three play their parts very well and the whole experience is an enjoyable tale. The film is only just over two hours but it seemed longer to me and although once you have seen the film you will know the ending it doesn't mean that you cant watch it again. If the film is quality like this one you can just enjoy it because it is that good. It holds your attention and anybody watching should just let it envelop them. I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone over 18 and once you have seen it you will know why.

24 March 2003,how more films should be,"i don't think cinema has ever been the same since the film seven took the world by storm. Almost every serial killer thriller since has tried to imitate sevens unique blend of darkness, mood, and ability to disturb. But none has and will ever come close to this. The build up of tension throughout the movie is like nothing else, and when it all finally snaps in the last few minutes, you're left with nothing but a sour taste in your dry mouth. Director fincher, knows how to pull an emotional punch, and he uses his actors like puppets. Masterfully crafting their performances to hyper realistic proportions. Every twist and turn in the story is done brilliantly, with the script being that rare thing of intelligence, wit, and both a good, and evil heart. Kevin Spacey comes across as almost sympathetic. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make a highly convincing pair of detectives, and the supporting cast are equally as brilliant. But the best part of the entire film is the ending, with it's great un-hollywood approach. I won't say anymore but it's an ending to cherish.

13 October 2018,Creatively Magically,"""Se7en"" (1995) is a dramatic crime mystery about two detectives, rookie detective David Mills played by Brad Pitt and veteran detective William Somerset played by Morgan Freeman, as they hunt for a serial killer murdering people according to the seven deadly sins. I have viewed this film several times since 1995 and every time I am pleasantly surprised by new information I missed the previous time. For example, when Morgan Freeman makes his own personal revelations, I would attribute it to a man set in his ways exiting the force and making things odd and difficult for other people involved. However, upon further review and paying close attention, all his anecdotes made perfect sense to the cases he was working, particularly the seven sins killer. This is an outstanding film.

David Fincher is an extremely incredible director and his affiliation with Brad Pitt adds to his ability to produce high quality products. This film is extremely dark and just in its color grading. The storyline is dark, the characters are dark, and the film reflects that. Fincher does a remarkable job getting the best acting performances out of all his actors which equates to the acting being superb. This film was not originally on my favorites list. It was a film that provided me with a high level of intrigue, but I have effectively shifted it to my top ten list. I really enjoy this fil and recommend it to any and everyone that enjoys a good movie with religious undertones.",9

17 February 2023,No redeeming features,"I was scrolling through the top 250 IMDB movies and was astounded to see this made the top 20! With my over 1300 rating on IMDB this is simply THE worst movie I have ever seen. I endured this movie rather than watched it. We went with a friend and only stayed to be polite. It was vulgar, crass ,violent, twisted and disturbing and adds nothing of benefit to those who watch it. If you enjoyed it you need to ask why, and perhaps see a Psychologist. The darkest side of humanity is on full display here and therefore had nothing positive to say (just like this review). The director has done far better work since.

9 November 1999,Second only to The Silence of the Lambs,"Se7en is easily one of the best psychological thrillers ever made. The only probelm being, like in David Fincher's Alien 3, that there isn't enough excitement for a thriller. The climax is excellent though - I won't spoil it for you, but when Sommersset says over his walkie-talkie: ""Doe has the upperhand"", it kicks off one of the most original and brave finales to any film for a long, long time. As to the issue of which is better, this or The Silence of the Lambs, I can only point to the fact that Lambs isn't the sort of film the Oscar board likes at all, and it was still awarded the five main Oscars. Se7en wasn't.

And please, if you are going to comment on Se7en yourself, DON'T GIVE AWAY WHO THE KILLER IS! Don't spoil it for those who haven't seen it.

5 March 2001,My number 19 movie,"Se7en is my number 19 movie. It is a great thriller with a great story and great performances. I had to watch this movie three times until I started liking it. But today I love it. It is about a guy that kills seven persons according to the deadly sins. I do not like Brad Pitt that much, Morgan Freeman is quite good, Kevin Spacey too, and Gwyneth Paltrow is OK. But this movie was ( sorry, IS ) just great.

Good points : characters, actors, acting, directing, story, and the way that it is told, ending, style, score,

Bad points : cannot think of anything, but it could have been better

All in all, I rate this movie 9.7/10 and recommend it to everyone who has not seen it yet. It is GREAT!!!

23 February 2003,Was this a low budget film or what?,"Gee, you'd think with all the big-name actors and actresses (Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Gwenyth Paltrow) in this movie, that they could have afforded something brighter than an 15 watt light bulb. This movie is dark. I'm not talking about the murder and the mystery. I'm talking about not being to see a darn thing during the movie. I mean, is there something bad about having a little color or light in a movie?

And everyone is so miserably unhappy all the time, you've got to wonder why they stay on those jobs. I mean, go to New Zealand and raise sheep! Go save whales for a year with Greenpeace! Get yourself a nightshift job at a Denny's! I mean, ANYTHING but working in that dark depressing city!

28 June 2006,Over-hyped rubbish.,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",2
8 March 2003,A Dark and Brilliant Film.,"My first introduction to the work of David Fincher was the oft panned ALIEN 3. While I hated this film less than most people, I was impressed by the overall look and the visual style. Several years later Fincher hit movie audiences in the face with SEVEN, which is a masterpiece of dark creeping atmosphere.

SEVEN follows the exploits of Detectives Sommerset and Mills, while on the trail of a killer who is violently acting upon the seven deadly sins (greed, sloth, pride, etc.). When broken down to that simple sentence, the film has the potential to collapse under its' own concept. The way the material is handled, however, shows inspiration and commitment by the film-makers. The movie is brutal and realistic; the murder scenes are unpleasant and not for the squeamish. The make-up effects by Rob Bottin are quite grotesque, especially the killer's ""prisoner"" who is found chained to a bed.

Morgan Freeman in the lead role finds the right balance between professionalism and frustration as the killer continues to elude him. Brad Pitt as Det. Mills, the new kid in town, is layered, with just the right amount of maniacal fervor. This is especially important considering Mills' actions during the conclusion of the story. If the character had not been established, the ending could have seemed forced or contrived. The way Pitt portrays this smart, but angry man, gives the film the push it needs to pull off the final act. Kevin Spacey, a third-act inclusion, covers much developmental ground in a short period of time.

Behind the scenes there dwells much talent: the photography by Darius Khondj is so good you can almost smell certain scenes, Arthur Max's prod. design is decaying Gothic in nature, and the pounding percussive score by Howard Shore rattles your nerves (Shore later went on to score The Lord of the Rings films). Andrew Kevin Walker's story is sharp and has an explosive resolution. David Fincher's direction cemented him as a film-maker with a distinct style and he has proved this in subsequent projects (although I am in the minority for hating FIGHT CLUB, yet this is mainly because of the story, not Fincher's direction).

It is true that not every single element of the film works, but I admire SEVEN simply for the scene where Sommerset goes to the library(!) to help solve the case, which is something you don't often see in your run-of-the-mill thriller. 10/10

Quick Trivia: in the published screenplay the ending takes place in a swamp; this actually makes sense considering that the characters are still in close proximity to a city where it rains on a constant basis. It also contains the opening scene that was cut from the film (it was later restored via the special edition DVD). The screenplay, itself, is also a good read, and of interest to fans and film-buffs.",10
9 February 2023,"Absolutely Gripping, A Masterclass in Suspense","Seven is dark and gripping film that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The film is a masterclass in suspense and tension. The story follows two detectives as they investigate a series of gruesome murders that seem to be inspired by the seven deadly sins. The film's grisly and unsettling tone, combined with its thought-provoking themes, make it a truly haunting and memorable experience. The twists and turns of the plot are expertly executed, which kept me guessing until the shocking conclusion. Overall, I've Seven a 9/10 for its gripping storyline, powerful performances, and expert filmmaking.

14 September 2002,Expect the unexpected.,"The TV was my babysitter when I grew up. I know all the plots, all the twists. When a movie surprises me, it's a cheat, a fraud, a deus ex machina. Or brilliant.

This movie is brilliant. Not a slow moment, a gory movie that is not a gore-fest, a shocking movie which does not rely on FX for shock, plot-driven, character-driven, absolutely brilliant. There are no loose ends, no descents into cliche. I thought that was where we were going: the hard-bitten veteran sparring with, and eventually becoming best friends with, the naive newcomer. But no!

I've said very little about the movie. I don't want to give anything away. SEE IT!

7 January 2002,Surprising Turn.,"What seemed to be a fairly typical formulaic serial killer mystery , with the older, world weary retiring cop, imparting his ""wiser"" and jaded view of the world on a younger new comer, takes a sudden unexpected turn and becomes a brilliant original. The conversation that transpires in the car between the two main detective characters and the killer on the way to the final scene is absolutely mesmerizing. What's really fascinating is to watch Detective Somerset's (Morgan Freeman) face as he listens to John Doe explain his view of the state of the world as he realizes how much it resembles his own view as stated just the night before in the bar with his partner. Especially in regard to the apathy of the populace. Of course John Doe's solution to the problem is perverted and psychotic. John Doe is a very effective representation of twisted religious fundamentalism that sees every one that doesn't follow their particular moral code as infidels deserving of death, and carrying out their death is only doing God's work. This movie comes out of nowhere to be a piercing thought provoker. Added note: Great and fitting closing credits song ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"" by David Bowie from his much underappreciated album, Outside.",7
6 April 2002,The ending left me in shivers!!,"""Se7en,"" or ""Seven,"" was David Fincher's second directorial film (after ""Alien 3""), and WHOA! His camera work was great, the script was well-done, the cast were magnificent, I just couldn't stop loving this movie! I loved every moment of this movie: every scene, every dialouge, and the music by Howard Shore gave audiences a shock with his style of music. But, what scared me the most was the ending. I had the shakes throughout the whole day after watching this movie. If you've never seen ""Se7en,"" then I suggest you see this first before seeing David Fincher's other films. Also, oscar-winner Kevin Spacey gave us a shocking performance as John Doe, the killer whose been doing the 7 deadly sins. Check this movie out!

15 September 1999,"Interesting, intriguing thriller","My Age: 13

Detective William Somerset, played by Morgan Freeman, is retiring from his job as a homicide police detective. Detective David Mills, played by Brad Pitt, has just arrived at homicide, and he and Somerset must work together when a serial killer begins killing perpetrators of the seven deadly sins. Somerset researches from the sources of the seven deadly sins to try and get into the mind of the killer while the victims and bodies keep piling up.

Seven comprises of two great acting performances from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, and supporting actors are good as well. The plot of Seven is very interesting and the story grabs hold of your attention and doesn't let go until the credits roll. It is a little boring, but it more than makes up for it in story. The killer's spiritual motives are fascinating and his final two victims are very well conceived. The ending climax is also fantastic and very well thought out. Seven is one of the best thrillers around and is definitely worth seeing.

28 May 2005,more like 4,"I used to have a thing for movies, but I think that I've more or less exhausted the supply of good ones. ""Seven"" was not one of the good ones, despite the high rating. The main problem comes in the form of the villain. I just didn't buy it. By going down the list of the seven deadly sins, it seemed like he was trying to incite reform amongst the people. However, he did it in a way that kept it from being relevant to the general populace. The scale was completely warped just for the sake of the number seven. There needed to be more blood spilled in a less ordered way to scare people, and I would argue that such a killer would know that. Fear motivates people and could have brought about the changes that all the characters wanted to see take place. That would have been an interesting movie--people dedicated to maintaining order realizing that the order needs to be subverted to do actual good. That is an interesting conflict. Could the divorce really happen? The groundwork was there for such action to take place, but the result would have been too thought-provoking to be thrilling for the average viewer. Fear shapes people's behavior more than anything else, when present. Think about how many churches you see on your way to work. Inertia takes over when fear is absent. The killer was too calculating to suffer so many ineptitudes. And speaking of ineptitude--I am saddened that people seem so incapable of telling the difference between a good movie and a bad one. Shame on you again.",4
24 March 2020,SEVEN,"There are seven original sins in human life, but it 's not a person 's seven emotions and six desires. Seven original sins correspond to seven virtues. It is these flashes and defects that make up a complete person. I like the acting skills of the three film actresses, and the plot is also closely connected, but I am far less like the killer than Jigsaw and Hannibal. Murdering others for the self-conceived god's morals, even letting the most sincere love fall, everything It was his paranoid extreme, he was not God but just a pure devil. Some people only see the darkness in this world, and then he falls into hell and dances with the devil, while some people can realize that this world can change and turn punishment into salvation, then he becomes a saint.

7 December 1999,Fincher's first descend into greatness,"David Fincher's last three movies have been so individually great and unique, they all speak for their own in different categories. What he does here is take a smart, clever, and grisly script by Andrew Kevin Walker, pull down the shades and throw Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in a cinematic game that will stand with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as the greatest thriller of the 90s.

Set in a city that is almost always gray and wet with rain, this movie does have a depressing feel, but watching this film over and over again, I always feel a bit giddy, as I know that Freeman's Det. Somerset isn't going to retire so easily and that Pitt's rookie Det. Mills is going to get one heck of a first case. They are great together from the start. Neither one has much of a sense of humor, but it's funny how odd of a couple they are. Somerset is patient, intelligent, and raises his voice as much as he reveals a smile. Mills look like a young lion as he jumps into enthusiasm when he works, caring more about action than about research.

The thing (and flaw) about Fincher movies is that there is hardly any women characters in them. Gwyneth Paltrow is very weak in her role as Mills' wife. She is only used for the climax in which the film is going. But the movie is such a distraction from that minor detail, it almost doesn't matter. The best sequence, hands down, is when Mills chases John Doe in his apartment, out of the window, into another building, onto a ledge, and into the murky streets of the nameless city.

One very smart move the movie has is not only revealing the character a good half hour before the movie is over, but giving him a speaking part which portrays him miles high over the usual cliched killers in cliched thrillers. You'll find very new things to watch in this movie, like other Fincher masterpieces THE GAME and FIGHT CLUB.

If the kids in SCREAM wanted more creative psycho killers, they got one, with murders like methodical and detailed puzzle pieces all coming to a wicked conclusion that puts everything in a bad game of jeopardy.",10

17 June 2022,7 stars as se7en,"The movie has a great idea. It catches your eye after the 40th minute. The story is as unique as cliche ,but still puts you under pressure to watch. The atmosphere in the movie is pretty much different than the others. We don't see only chasing through the whole movie. We see moments of thinking. Moments of pressure. Moments where we can see what does the character value in life. We get hints throughout the story that we never suspected for hints. The ending is as surprising as predictable. I wish it would've ended well for the detective ,bad for the killer ,but in interesting non-predictable way. The acting was middle. It does get you involved into the story without thinking it for movie, but it also makes you see some regular moments.

31 October 2003,Possibly the best crime thriller ever,"Se7en

Rating: 9 out of 10. Directed by David Fincher.

When I first saw 'Se7en' eight years ago, I thought that I'd never see it again. The first viewing left me in a horrified and miserable mood. Even though I felt the movie was really well made, the dark empty feeling was so intense. Eight years later, I find myself viewing 'Se7en' for the eighth time. So on average, I see this movie once a year. It is still intense to view, but much easier to take in, yet on each viewing, I notice little details that I missed on previous viewings.

'Se7en' follows the story of a deranged killer John Doe played brilliantly by Kevin Spacey. John Doe viciously kills his victims, treating his acts as sentences for those who sin.

Investigating the murders are Detective Somerset played by Morgan Freeman, and Detective Mills played by Brad Pitt. As their investigation goes deeper, the two detectives find themselves subjugated in John Doe's plan.

Some quotes from 'Se7en':

William Somerset (Morgan Freeman): If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil, I mean if he's Satan himself, that might live up to our expectations, but he's not the devil. He's just a man.

William Somerset (Morgan Freeman): This guy's methodical, exacting, and worst of all, patient.

David Mills (Brad Pitt): He's a nut-bag! Just because the f#@ker's got a library card doesn't make him Yoda!

John Doe (Kevin Spacey): We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. And what I've done is going to be puzzled over, and studied, and followed... forever.",9

2 March 2001,David Fincher's best film & Best Thriller film,"Six years after seeing the film, ""Se7en"" is considered, in my opinion, the best creation of one brilliant director: David Fincher. Starting his career with George Lucas in ""The Return of the Jedi"" as camera assistant, now he's one of the most acclaimed film directors in the world.

His first worldwide known production was ""Alien3"", a sequel of the famous alien saga, the worst of all the saga, however. Then, in 1995, ""Se7en"" was out, and became a total success.

The film is a creepy, thriller production with a crew full of stars: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Palthrow and the awesome 72nd Academy Award Winner Kevin Spacey (as leading role in AMERICAN BEAUTY). And the film was also an innovation in using weird and strange openings. This style was followed by several films like ""Mimic"", ""Arlington Road"", ""Spawn"", ""Fight Club"", etc.

Focusing on the film, ""Se7en"" introduces us Detectives David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) that are investigating several crimes which at first glance with no connection between them. After a deep search, they will find that only one man is behind all the murderers and with a philosophy: the seven capital sins.

With this plot, the film seems to be as other productions of the genre, but it's not. There are several points of ""Se7en"" that should be mentioned:





The following films of Fincher (""The Game"", ""Fight Club"", etc.) carry on the style created in ""Se7en"". I must say that all the thrillers produced after ""Se7en"" are just a rough copy of Fincher's masterpiece: they have just copied the atmosphere of the film but with no success. ""Se7en"" is the best one nowadays, no matter the budget, no matter the crew.

David Fincher makes the difference. ""Se7en"" is an example, a brilliant masterpiece. WORTH LOOK!!!!!!! 10/10

One thing that I still think about is: why didn't ""Se7en"" win any Academy Awards Oscar in 1995? I found it unfair and still think so.",10
27 August 2007,Brilliant neo-noir with incredible cinematography and a gut-wrenching climax.,"I love ""Se7en"". It's captivating, horrifically repulsive, thought provoking, and violently thrilling. Fincher's style creates a foreboding and appealing atmosphere that makes you HAVE to look, even if mounting tension and repulsion would compel you to do otherwise. Fincher shows you some very disturbing, bloody things in this film, but he pulls back and uses implication rather than illustration at the perfect times. The climax is incredible in its ability to effect you, forcing you to be introspective about what you would do in the character at center stage's position. Few films have engaged me emotionally and mentally in such a way.

This is due to the dark nature of the movie but at the same time I love the attention to details.

10 November 2002,Remarkably disturbing and dark,"This movie made the seven deadly sins famous. Before this film, much of the mainstream audience could not even name one deadly sin.

This movie creates a great atmosphere, with a soundtrack that boasts the impending dread and doom in the both the storyline and the lives of the characters. I thought this is one of Brad Pitts greatest roles, along with Seven Years in Tibet.

The last ten minutes of the film are the greatest in cinematic history, IMHO. The end is totally mind blowing but adds greatly to give a satisfying end to the story.

Watch this movie on a rainy night with a good surrond sound system! Some scenes will be etched in your memory for a long time. I still cant forget the murder dealing with sloth and gluttony.

2 April 2009,The best executed Police Drama,"I must say that I consider Brad Pitt as a serious actor. He is not like the other pretty faces in Hollywood, he actually has talent and does not depend only in his looks. I think that he is really smart choosing roles (Fight Club, Snatch, Kalifornia, etc.) with a few exceptions. Morgan Freeman is really great as well and does his job like nobody could ever dream.

The relationship they develop during the film feels genuine, despite the clichés. That is the cornerstone in this movie, its authenticity. What we have here is a masterpiece with its position at the IMDb top 250 very well earned (unlike some other movies). The script exceeded my expectations, the photograph shows a really depressing place which is good for setting the mood, and the performances are great. Even if the movie it's not fast-paced, it managed to capt our attentions. This film has also one of the best endings in my opinion. I really enjoyed this movie a lot and I recommend it to everyone.

A definitely must see before you die film. It might not disappoint anyone. This is one of those films that makes you keep thinking about them hours after you watched it.",10
8 March 2001,"Kids, Don't Kill in the Name of God","SE7EN is quite an extroardinary film. Unlike most films, which make everything sound so nice, this film bludgeons you with depressing images. The film is a ripe slice of hell, and is one film that you'll remember. If you think you were pretty cool during the gruesome scenes, you'll probably have nightmares later. David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker(wasn't he an assasin? On no, that was Mark David Chapman) craft the film very well. Every scene is framed well, and there is a feeling of bleakness. This film goes against the ""it's not what you think, it's what you're wearing"" complacent culture to show the ""eminent death"" culture. Think about it, won't you? Gwyneth Paltrow is talented, and cute too. Brad Pitt is dumber than a bag of hammers, and Morgan Freeman is a noble savage. Kevin Spacey gave me the jim-jams something awful! Rating: 9/10(The end was a little ridiculous)

5 December 2022,"""THE BEST""serial killing movie","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10

17 June 2004,Brad Pitt is Mediocre,"I don't know if Brad Pitt is just a so-so actor or if his being in the same movie with Morgan Freeman just makes it appear that way. Freeman is one of my choices for best actor in Hollywood today. Off-screen he appears to be as quiet and dignified as he does on-screen. He is one of the Hollywood actors who, thank God, you never hear spout the political bird-droppings that so many in Hollywood are prone to these days and which have surely diminished Hollywood in so many eyes. The movie was a fine vehicle for Freeman, who seems born to the role of the thinking police detective. I was somewhat turned off by Pitts affected accent in this movie which, by and large, with the exception of a few scenes, held my attention and there were several scenes that were riveting. I don't know why, but the first time I saw this movie I considered it just so-so but on viewing it again I've changed my opinion and now consider it better than average.

14 June 2002,Great thriller!,"*Se7en*

Last night I watched Se7en for the second time and threw it I picked up things I didn't pick up the first time. It got better with second viewing! It follows the crime case of two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt)on the trail of a ""psycho killer"" killing people by the seven deadly sins (hence the name). All throughout the film there is mystery. It puts you right there with the detectives, making you feel like you're trying to solve the crime too.

The acting from Brad Pitt isn't great. There's just a tone in his voice that sounds like he's trying too hard. Morgan Freeman on the other hand was great, you just can't get enough of his voice. Kevin Spacey was excellent. Gwyeneth Paltrow was good also.

The end was the best part. I want give it away for those who haven't seen it. But theres about five minutes left in the movie and I kept thinking, how are they going to end it? They did a fine job and I was quite impressed.

*9/10*",
29 July 2003,A classic crime thriller.,"A much more disturbing movie than Silence of the Lambs, or anything of its ""ilk"". This film from start to finish is an unsettling, intriguing, gritty ride through the macarbe world of ""se7en"". This is a brilliant crime thriller from the director of Fight Club, Fincher, who uses his great use of camera work and dark imagination to bring this film to life.

The killings that are on offer are only shown after they have actually happened, which is an intresting slant on things, unlike many new thrillers where we see someone get brutally muredered, with blood and guts needlessly flying to and fro. This is great stuff from Fincher, yet where he really does himself proud is in a certain shoot out scene with the mysterious killer John Doe, which is filmed brillaintly, with great cinematography. It's brutal, stark and gritty - what Fincher captures best. The acting on offer is superb - Freeman plays it well as the old detective, who is retiring, but stays on for this last case. Freeman is well spoken, and he is playing opposite a great Brad Pitt, who plays Detective Mills, a cocky, full of it new detective, who plays the part with ease, showing us the difference between the two characters, one being old, wise, the other being young, brash. Kevin Spacey, for the time he is in the film, shows great presence as the mysterious weirdo John Doe, who is cooly evil. This is the new meaning of film noir, the new meaning of thriller, horror, crime, what have you - this movie is a classic, brutal, gritty, real, horrific, disturbing - there are too many words. Just see it. Oh and be surprised by the credit scenes, which are EXTREMELY good.

9 October 2022,"""Seven"" just seems try-hard.","On the surface, it's cohesive and entertaining enough in its own way - visuals, pace, casting, for example - but it's very average, nothing spectacular. I guess it could have been OK if I didn't require some realistic human behaviour in the movies that I watch (even when the plot is as implausible as it gets). Predictability isn't the main problem with the conclusion; the taste that it leaves in my mouth, is. I wish I hadn't spent the time watching this.

The movie that I watched immediately prior to this one was ""Cleanskin"" - it's rated lower on imdb, but it's a far superior entertainment experience.

""Seven"" just seems try-hard.

30 November 2019,Best detective mystery EVER,"Fincher delivers what is quite possibly the twistiest of all mystery thrillers in true David Fincher fashion. The story is about as perfect as any detective mystery can be as each twist and turn brings the audience closer in to the story. Each new clue hits harder than the last one to the point where it all builds up to what is likely one of the most suspenseful finales of all time. The dark tone also serves to up the tension as only a David Fincher film could. The personal more quiet moments also get one to feel for the characters so that the finale just hits even harder. Pitt and Freeman work magic together on screen and Spacey delivers one of his most impactful performances despite VERY limited screen time. Ultimately this all leads to a finale that is actually quite philosophical and leaves one thinking about the natural condition of man and where we may stand before God on our own power.

24 August 2022,Wow Just wow,"When I finished watching ""Se7en""I couldn't help but sit back on my sofa and ponder the brilliance of this movie. Absolutey perfect casting with an impressive performance by both Brad Pitt and Morgan freeman. A staple into their impressive resumes for both Pitt and Freeman. The movie highlights Freeman a soon to be retired detective and Pitt a detective new to the force. Soon to be retired Freeman can't seem to care less about these unfolding murders to start. He goes on to realize what kind of ending to his lasting image would be showed if he didn't take this case. Impressively played and impressively written ""Seven"" is a great crime/mystery movie with an incredible twist.

Still, at this particular moment I cannot think of an American Suspense Thriller that has ever been as beautiful and compelling as this unique serial-crime drama. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are both amazing and play well off of one another, Freeman especially. Gwyneth Paltrow does a brilliant job with her brief stint in the film. Kevin Spacey's portrayal of John Doe is uncompromisingly haunting and utterly disturbing. This all wrapped up with, what at the time was the most courageous ending in years.

2 February 2021,The Most Nihilistic Anti-Nihilist Film Ever Made...Believe it or Not.,"""Ernest Hemingway once wrote 'the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.""

In my explorations into evil, I, along with many other people are often faced with the question into how we must face evil in the world. Should we face it and attempt to extinguish it or tolerate it and allow it to go on, because of course there's nothing that we can do to stop it. I've found that nihilism is alluring and can be persuasive, but it's the easy way out, a way for people to drown in their misery and pain rather than getting up and attempting to make their lives and the world better. On the one hand, I'm often baffled when I hear people call Se7en a nihilistic film, when it's so clearly not the case.

Indeed, Se7en is a film seeped in nihilism, and to the untrained eye it seems to be falling in completely to the traps of nihilistic thought. It is a peak noir, soaked in hard boiled cynicism and a grungy, unpleasant atmosphere that is both off-putting and remarkably fitting for its cold, bleak landscape. Fincher is a director who is not afraid to look into the abyss of human depravity and darkness, and Se7en shows in full display the true depravities and wickedness that man is capable of. But Se7en's nihilism is often ironic in tone, almost challenging the audience to buy into it, before pulling the rug out from under the audience's feet and exploring its true message.

Se7en is deceptive, it is difficult, both on an emotionally visceral level and on an intellectual level. At first it seems like a standard noir about two detectives, who don't quite agree with each other and bicker from time to time, going after a deranged psychopath who is leading them on a chase until its inevitable, dark conclusion. But Se7en is different in its ability to force the audience to engage with it. You're only given the characters, what they believe, what they say vs what they do, and how they change over time, and that I think is the greatest strength of Se7en.

Somerset is the pinnacle jaded detective, a grizzled old timer beaten down by a hostile, depraved world and a laundry list of bad decisions and regrets that eat away at him, every day of his life. He's given up entirely and has sunk into the pits of despair and nihilism, itching for the day of his retirement so that he can get the hell out of this place that's caused him so much misery for so many years. He is the standard noir protagonist, yet unlike more 'tough guy' personalities, Freeman plays Somerset as a world weary old man, experienced in its ways. He's not overtly tough or badass in any way, but he's hardly a pushover. It is his arc that gives the film most of its meaning, as he goes through a subtle change from a depressed, broken man into a hopeful and reinvigorated one. It is difficult, filled with strife and some of the most horrific imagery that I've ever seen in a film, along with some harrowing implications of what happened, as it's known, what's not shown is often much scarier than that what is. Somerset is the film's soul, contradictory and haunted all at once.

Mills is Somerset's foil in some ways, he is more optimistic and hopeful in nature than Somerset, quick tempered and spontaneous, and openly challenges Somerset in his own assumptions and beliefs. He is probably the most tragic character of the film, as while he chips away at Somerset's beliefs and makes him a better man for it, he ends up paying a hefty price for it. He is steadfast and defiant in his beliefs, unable to give up hope even when it seems to be against him, which rubs off on his more cynical, jaded partner and makes him a better man for it. He may lose everything by the end, but his change of Somerset is what makes his role so impactful and shows that he did make a difference, even if he personally lost. If Somerset is the film's soul, Mills is its heart.

John Doe is not merely the villain of the film, he is a dark foil to Somerset. Much like Somerset, Doe is a man who's been completely shattered by the world around him. Though unlike Somerset, Doe decides to take much more extreme and disturbing measures in response to the constant psychological pain that he goes through every day. He ironically becomes the personification of the evil and nihilism that repulses him. Unlike Somerset, he is a man willing to take action, rather than allowing it to keep existing. Like Mills, he makes a deep impression on Somerset, a sobering reality on what he could have become if he chose to give in to his most carnal desires. He serves as a reminder to Somerset on why evil must be vanquished, and why he simply can't give in to apathy and nihilism. If Mills had convinced him that humanity was worth the trouble, then Doe was the one who hammered it home to Somerset why stopping evil matters, why nihilism and apathy are futile, and why the fight for what's good and noble matters. It is to keep the good, innocent people safe, without thanks or a reward. Doe is the film's dark underbelly, the personification of everything that it's railing against, but it's also a pointer to who not to become when dealt with pain and adversity.

The lesson of Se7en, and the lesson that Somerset learns, is that despite all of the evil and depravity around us, it doesn't mean that we should lay down and allow it to keep existing. Like Somerset, we need to understand that to combat evil, we can't just give in and accept its existence, but that we must go out and confront it everyday and do our best to stop it. Now we won't go out and magically solve it over night, and we won't always succeed in completely vanquishing evil, but like with all processes, it only takes one day at a time, and exploring the dangers of succumbing to nihilism and how it is unproductive and even harmful.

Se7en is a perfect modern noir in every sense of the word. It's dark, moody, intensely violent, and atmospheric. But what makes it unique is its subtle, yet deeply profound message about hope and retaining it even in the darkest of spots. Indeed it's an odd film to talk about when it comes to hope when it seems so flagrantly against it. But like with all great films, its true message is elusive, and hard to find, but it certainly can be if you look hard enough.

So no, I don't believe that Se7en is an endorsement of nihilism. In fact, it's a refutation of it.",10
29 January 2021,Best Third Act Ever?,"Wow this movie is good. It's easily the most gruesome, dark and skin-crawling movie I've seen. It's an exhibition is wordless storytelling which is not only a credit to the director but also who play there're roles beautifully: Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is an emotional hot-head. He plays the role so well that everything that unfolds in the final act seems almost logical. Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a wise veteran, about to retire. He is a perfect juxtaposition to to Mills, as he is mainly detached from emotion and focuses on the crime rather than the man. John Doe (Kevin Spacey) is a serial killer, the antagonist of the movie. Spacey embodies the psychopath persona perfectly and plays the role beautifully, helping us understand this incomprehensible character. The movie creates a seriously disturbing environment. It presents the city as a character through the constant rain, crime and overall grim nature. It's also helped by how the characters talk about, almost how it's someone you don't like, but have to put up with. The characters are brilliantly as each of the characters are so intertwined that you can clearly see each one rubbing off on each other. The characters are also so well understood, making their arcs feel as if you have a personal stake in it. Creates ominous fear and dread for the antagonist, even before we've met him. The movies score is on par with joker for invoking fear. Incredible ability to present how much they long to catch this guy through the facial expressions and how they're willing to go outside the law, despite being police. Lots symbolism for the final act making us thinking we've won: The only sunshine through the whole movie, and the first laugh since the first murder. Lots of great subtlety portraying the characters, from how mills runs into the building before Somerset, showing the youthful exuberance to how mills uses pop culture references, such as yoda, to Somerset's old dialect and going to a library. Every plot point pays off and the brilliant religious imagery foreshadowing the final act. If you haven't watched this and had the ending spoilt by anyone, I can only apologise. 10/10",10
22 January 2005,Very good movie with shocking ending.,"Se7en is an undoubtful masterpiece concerning suspense, locations and camera. The actors are also brilliant and the story is one of the most thrilling and intelligent of our time. Really great: none of the killings are shown and are left to the mind of the viewer. So, why should someone like me who has just written so nicely about this movie rate it with just se7en stars? It is because of its ending. Surprisingly indeed, but... I think, a little too surprising. In the ending this movie seems to lack in logic. The characters Pitt and Freeman are playing make some progress in the story and they get to know each other better and better. Freeman's role is the one of a very intelligent cop who often has to calm down the hot-headed character Pitt is playing. But in the last minutes of the movie - I cannot imagine why - he doesn't calm him down and absolutely underestimates the danger. It seems to me that this movie just wanted to have a surprising, shocking ending (it really doesn't need to have!!!) and spoiled it a little bit to me. But anyway, this is a brilliant movie everyone should have watched. Once again, se7en out of ten!

17 February 2010,"Dark, Disturbing, Moody, and Excellent","David Fincher has always had a very different style from that of other directors. Whether it is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's drowned out feel or Fight Club's frenetic hipster camera-work, it's Se7en that definitely is his best film. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give excellent performances while the script engrosses the audience. Any way one looks at it, this film is great and there's no doubt about it.

Se7en follows two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) in their search to find ""Jonathan Doe"" (who later appears as Kevin Spacey), a murderer who has been leaving crime scenes that follow the Seven Deadly Sins. Freeman is great as an old, wise detective who is ready to retire while Pitt only good as a cop turned detective who is looking for action. Pitt's wife, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, makes for a good secondary character who is constantly trying to relate to the two detectives in their search. As the detectives push further to solve the case, the crime scenes become grislier and tensions rise in the corrupt, rainy unnamed city.

There's many great things about Se7en, but one of the best is the opening credits. One might ask how the opening credits can be so great, but it must be seen to be believed. The opening credits consists of many cut together shots of someone, presumably ""Jonathan Doe"", creating a disturbing notebook of photographs and letters set to music that is barely even music, but rather just creaking. Most of the shots are shaky and overexposed and yet so beautiful. How is it possible that something so beautiful? Only David Fincher could achieve a sequence so effective. The credits set the tone wonderfully through the movie and, if watched very closely, clues to the plot can be unlocked. If anything, the credits are worth a look.

To continue explaining Fincher's greatness, one must explain how he creates the tone of the movie and what he does that makes the viewers feel disturbed by the end of the movie. Although there is almost no violence on-screen, the crime scenes are enough to make people feel sick. Every shot in the movie is very dark and almost hard to understand. There are no shades of bright colors throughout the whole movie. These dark shots, which may remind many viewers of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, give the film a very gloomy feel that no other film really does. Combine the shades of black and gray with the gruesome crime scenes and one gets a very dark and creepy movie.

There really is no other way to say it: Se7en is quite an amazing movies. There's some brilliant direction from David Fincher (as per usual) and great performances from the cast. The movie is thrilling and at the same time brutal forcing audience members to wonder whether or not they would like to finish the movie. Roger Ebert once said that a true film buff sees films that nobody else has heard of. I must say that I disagree. To become a true film buff means seeing movies like this and then appreciating and understanding them. It is a movie like Se7en that stands the test of time and is universally regarded as wonderful by movie buffs and everyday movie watchers alike.",10

27 April 2022,My wife wants to see the head!!!,"Without saying WHO the head is of, we were watching this the other night when a head in a box is delivered, and someone opens the box but we can't see inside it. My wife is yelling (honestly) ""SHOW US THE HEAD!!!"". She was so disappointed that we didn't see the head that 3 days later she's still talking about it, so I downgraded my better rating to account for me having to put up with a movie that didn't SHOW US THE HEAD!!!

I suppose today it would be CGI'd in but they could have put something in the box to see and I wouldn't have to listen to my wife talking about it days later!!!

3 April 2007,great suspense,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

15 August 2007,Excellent piece of film making,"This is quite simply one of the best pieces of film making in cinematic history. I watch a lot of horror/serial killer flicks and for the most part, 99% of them all follow the same formula. Se7en on the other hand goes by no script ever presented before. This is a totally original, imaginative and twisted tale that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire way through. It is quite simply one of the most well written movies I've ever seen and ranks as #3 on my all time favorite movies.

The ending is like nothing I've ever seen before and totally blew my mind. You never see it coming, but it is sheer genius! A true must see, movie.

8 April 2002,Only 5 for 7,"It had a very promising start. Opening credits were interesting and the photography was wonderful. All was going well until we were introduced to the main characters (Freeman and Pitt).

Basically these characters are overly simplistic and rather cliched.

Freeman the extremely well learned and rational cop and Pitt the gung-ho non-intellectual (anti) are about as believable as munchkins.

Unfortunately this movie seems to have been made to gratuitous ly use hollywoods most popular actors (at the time) rather than a good movie.

Sorry, watch Silence of the Lambs if you want a good movie of this genre.

2 November 2003,Gory.,"I saw the movie for the 2nd time last night, and I still don't like it. If you've got a strong stomach and like violent movies, then the film may be something for you. I don't think I will take the trouble of watching it again.

Nice thing is the unexpected ending, although the detective act quite stupid: they follow John Doe's plan exactly.

Overall: 4/10.

31 July 2022,Dark and Grim...just the way I like it.,"There's no way around it. This film just gets more horrifying and depressing with every twist and turn. So why is it that so many viewers will consistently come back to watch ""Se7en"" for the fifth, sixth, or se7enth time? I don't have an answer to that. This is my favourite film. I think something is wrong with me.

13 May 2007,"Morgan Freeman, another Zodiac killer detective","In this analysis the number system based on 12 using 7 is analyzed as symbolic under the Christian Orthodox faith. This case deals with visual-audio signals used by a serial killer professing to be a judge of 7 deadly sins. By his judgment actor Kevin Spacey plays the role of the executioner.

What does 7 really mean from the Bible. The 7 Churches of Ephesus in Persia were well known during the time of Jesus Christ in the Middle East. Does 7 really have a symbolic notion underlying a meaning that is a numeration of sins recognized by the Chatholic faith that are meant have no other judgment but death by the nature of that sin, and carnation.

Judgement of life questions the essence of spiritual energy that for Roman Catholics is the Holy Spirit. As for philosophy of science we are determined to have free will or determination to act. This is the duality of Jesus Christ where people are utilized due to the essence of the Holy Spirit from the father for political science and administration of justice. Thus, the motives of actor Kevin Spacey in this film as analyzed by actor Morgan Freeman as a detective are based on a catalog of environmental stress over time that manifests itself as becoming a good judge of people. The climax ending is the truth to the plot of Seven, that actor Kevin Spacey is his own Jesus Christ with the above understanding of an Orthodox viewpoint and mundane references to numerous accounts of how the number seven is used in the Holy Bible.

I question the plot of this film based on the use of numbers as with other television shows such as the Electric Company from Public Broacasting System (PBS), and Himitsu Setai Goranger. As based on natural science theory and philosophy of science as the Freemansons utilized history and great minds to create new technology they manipulated numbers. Other than for analysis key historic dates were 1717 and 1919. I think an argument can be made as much as why the number seven is a focal point but of little value in the Holy Bible as numbers are used by Freemasons to establish brotherhood, or occult.

Personally I would like to see the actor Morgan Freeman and actor James Earl Jones appear in a film plot as wise men traveling to see the Emperial Chinese family of the Han Dynasty for information to save their people. As found by the valuable silk road into Africa, where the stars are used with ancient astrology. They in turn exchange stolen information about an Egyptian djed.",7

18 September 1999,You will never forget this movie,"Never have I met someone who has seen this movie and upon hearing it mentioned go ""Oh Seven. I think I may remember that one."" No one forgets SE7EN. It stays with you forever, whether you consider that good or bad, it stays. Every time you see a movie with a shock, or a movie with a bizarre feel and ending, you will think of this. I have seen thousands of films, most of them twice. This is the best one I have ever seen. That's all I can say about it.

20 April 2001,Shows how good an actor Brad Pitt is,"I personally think that Brad Pitt is under-rated as an actor. He is considered a pretty boy in Hollywood. But if you took a moment and went over all of his films, he never really has done, accept several, pretty boy movies. He is personally one of my favorite actors.

If you don't believe me I think you should sit down and watch several of his films, especially this one. I could never picture Freddie Prinze Jr. or anybody else ever daring to take on this kind of role. That is why I refuse to sit down and watch those sort of films. I do not like to waste my money.

The plot is very basic. Morgan Freeman is a week from retirement. Brad Pitt is the new guy in town. They both team up to catch a serial killer who kills people by the seven deadly sins.

You can always count on Morgan Freeman to be brilliant. I have yet to see him in a project he looks bad in. But I must say, since this film he seems to be only taking the smart-detective role, accept for ""Nurse Betty"".

Brad Pitt is wonderful in his role. He portrays a man who is dedicated to both his family and his work. Though he isn't anywhere near as smart as Somerset, he certainly trys. In a funny scene, Somerset travels to the library to read up on the sins. Mills mearly settles for the cliff notes of the sins.

A must see for all fans of the film is the newly released DVD. It is filled with tons of extras and some great deleted scenes that could have been kept in the film.

Overall it is a masterful film and an ending that needs to be seen to be believed. I very highly recommend the film. 9.5/10",
28 January 2021,You won't soon forget this one...,"One of the best truly psychological thrillers I have ever seen. Violent but not in a graphic sense. All the nasty and graphic violence is truly left to the imagination and that's what makes this movie so damn good! Brad and Morgan, what a combo! With a little Gwyneth Paltrow sprinkled in for more flavor to this classic dish. I'm done. A true classic!

9 April 2006,A Very Nicely Done Thriller,"Before I review this movie I should say that Morgan Freeman almost always does an excellent job in any movie he is in. This movie is not different. Brad Pitt is the other lead and does a fair job but the reason to watch this movie is because of Freeman and his typically sterling performance. Here they play two detectives on the trail of a gruesome murderer. This is one of those rare movies that was hyped and it lived up to the hype. The publicity surrounding this movie with it's two leads and the theme of the film was immense and the movie was as good as hyped. The mystery kept you guessing, the, thrills kept you a little tense throughout, and the ending was a shocker.

The key to this movie was that the script told an intense and somewhat complicated story in a simple manner. The cinematography, the score, and the overall atmosphere of this movie provided an excellent atmosphere to such a dark and gritty movie. The plot is fairly old, two detectives on the trail of a murderer, but the actors and the direction manage to make this variation on the formula very enjoyable, and seem original, when it really isn't.

But as I said before the key to this movie was Morgan Freeman and his performance. Everybody in this movie feeds off of his demeanor and his presence. He does so good he even makes Brad Pitt seem like a god actor. There is a nice supporting cast in this movie, R. Lee Ermey, Richard Roundtree, and even, well, okay, Gwyneth Paltrow, who really can't act. But the most surprising supporting cast member is Kevin Spcaey just a few months before he became famous.

But the movie also asks a number of moral questions, in examining American society and our many vices, it examines our drive, our motivations, and ultimately our failings, and how our vices can be maximized to hurt ourselves. When I got out of this movie I was very shocked, this was quite a surprising movie, I did't expect anything like it and I was surprised at it. This is a rarity because in modern day a movie like this would be dissected by the studio, and wouldn't be allowed to have the same kind of theme and intensity it does now, it would be way to fluffy, by Hollywood standards anyway. With that said watch this movie if you want a to a nice gory little gem.",
12 February 2012,"A Brilliant, dark, creepy film","This film is one of the best serial killer films I've seen. It is a very dark film and it is nearly always raining.. I loved Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in this, two different characters who seem to get along more and more as the film goes on. Its also nice to see Gwnyeth Paltrow playing the role of Brad Pitts caring loving wife in it. This film is not for the faint hearted as there are gruesome scenes and shocks. The film is about two detectives going after a serial killer who kills his victims based on the seven deadly sins : gluttony, lust, sloth,wrath,greed, pride and envy. It seems pretty simple, but as the film goes on you become more interested in the plot and want to see what treat the killer has left this time. When the killer is revealed is my favourite scene in the movie, you don't see it coming and it's brilliant. After the film had ended, I had so many emotions going through me. I felt depressed, shocked, amazed and even some happiness. This film shows the brilliance of David Fincher and if you have not seen this film go and watch it.

24 August 2001,the most exquisitely decorated splatter film of all time,"Former wiz kid David Fincher set his legend into motion with this impressively claustrophobic, exquisitely decorated film which loosely comments on the seven deadly sins (hence the title) but more pertinently focuses on the brilliantly cracked mind of a serial killer. Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and even the supremely gifted Morgan Freeman are naught but secondary window dressing next to the revelatory production design and art direction by Arthur Max and Gary Wissner respectively. Se7en establishes a new standard for the impact of set design in a horror/slasher picture and provided the box office clout Fincher needed to mastermind his near perfect ""Fight Club.""

6 April 2021,In depth characters because of slow pace,"Let's start off with the characters. The two detectives are fleshed out during their job as well as outside of work which really makes you connect with them throughout. The acting is incredible from all 4 leads, and I believe it is the strongest aspect of the film. This might be Brad Pitt's best performance I've seen so far. The ending is super creative in which you really do not know what to expect making it one of the best in film history some people say. Now for the negatives. The main focus of the story seems to meander a bit throughout the runtime with much of the time focused on the characters personal life which isn't always a bad thing but for this type of story, I would prefer a more focused plot. The film has a tough time picking up the pace until maybe 60% through when the famous parts of the movie are shown. The rest of the film before the third act just seems kinda forgettable. In fact, I have seen the film for the first time 2 years ago and when I saw it again today, I only remembered the ending which is kinda unfortunate. This is still a solid film but it is a tad bit overrated in my opinion. A film can't deserve a perfect score because of only one standout scene.",7

29 April 2002,Best detective thriller ever,"With Fincher's 'Panic Room' coming out next week, I decided to watch this gem of a detective thriller from 1995. I must say, however, that I watched the butchered BBC version which (for some God unknown reason) was shown pre-watershed AND with an hour's break in-between to show the news. This did not spoil my enjoyment, though, as it's one hell of a movie.

I've seen loads of detective thrillers (Kiss the Girls, Hangman, Resurrection, Along Came a Spider, etc.) and this puts them all to shame. It even seems unfair to pigeon-hole a movie this good, but anyhow there's a lot to like about it:

The atmosphere created by Fincher is excellent, and the gloominess adds to the dark subject matter of the movie. It always seems to be dark and raining, and the filth of the city is really captured. The atmosphere is like a character all its own.










Anyone thinking of seeing Panic Room (or have already seen it) check this out. Brilliant.",
28 February 2021,I Was Not Impressed,"Back in the 90's, I spent a good deal of time frequenting my local video stores, so I was baffled that I had not seen Se7en. A 90's masterpiece that I somehow let slip through the cracks. How could I have missed out on this gem? That's simple, because it sucked. I probably did see it and just plain forgot. It's the typical cop mismatched partner movie who chase after a serial killer. Completely illogical script. Dumb ending with even dumber twist. Freeman, Pitt, Spacey and the rest did their jobs. Regardless, just a stupid story

27 February 2023,Se7en review,"Se7en almost starts as cliché whodunit film rookie and veteran cop work together, to find a killer, but Se7en is far from any cliché. From the first scene it is clear this not going to be cliché film it is visceral, and dark. But the violence in the movie is never shown and that makes it even more grim because you have to think about it yourself , you can make something up in your own imagination what the actual act of violence is.

The two detectives are portrayed by Morgan Freeman playing detective William Somerset and Brad Pitt playing detective David Mills. The two are portraying their characters well and the chemistry between them helps the movie a lot, there are no constant arguments which is really nice.

The killer is inspired by the seven deadly sins how to kill and to choose his victim. The killer is excellently portrayed by Kevin Spacey, his performance is almost eery because he plays the killer not as over the top psychopath but as a smart well thought out killer.

The cinematography (the way it was shot with camera) fits well with the darkness of the movie itself.

All in all, I think Se7en is one of those few perfect movies out there, the acting is great, the story and twist and turns are original, the pace of the movie is very nice, and it is well written. I think is just perfect.",9
25 April 2020,Se7en: the perfect crime,"The film starts with the victims, who are treated cruelly and are almost invisible to the viewer.Beneath the cloak of thriller and suspense, ""se7en"" hides a pessimistic core, a Shakespearean tale of tragedy and heartbreak.""The world is a good place to be and worth fighting for. I only agree with the second half.""

23 June 2023,Amazing if you exclude the music,"This is probably one of the best movies ive ever watched however the soundtrack wasnt fitting to the movie at all. If i listened to it by itself it is still breath takingly good -just not within the movie-. The suspense is already built with the usage of environment, light and storyline. The soundtrack was overly suspenseful at very unnecessary places. It kinda felt like the movie was written without an ost at first and I'd rather watch it like that. I really appreciate other works of the composer but not this one.

Apart from that i really enjoyed the storyline. The ending wasnt vague although it wasnt that hard to predict so it didnt get boring. I already love the actors so im just dargging it out to meet the character requirement. :)

15 March 2003,"A dark, shocking work of near-masterpiece proportions","I first saw this movie when I was eight, and, just to show how much my generation is desensitized, it didn't scare me. Having seen it several times since, I now realize that this is in fact one of the most shocking films ever made. Between 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', David Fincher has created two flawed masterpieces. Se7en itself is brilliantly done, with a horrifying, remarkable twist ending, and Kevin Spacey as John Doe, a serial killer on par with Hannibal Lecter. The only flaw with this movie is it's lack of deeper morals. Sure, it shows the overall evils of today's world, but it feels as though it's missing something essential, a feeling of humanity.

7 June 2004,A great crime thriller.,"SE7EN is the story of two detectives working on their first (and last) murder case together. Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire and seems to be a bit show-offish around his partner Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), who continues to try to prove that he is a competent detective, despite Somerset's uncertainty. But the two are forced to put their differences aside when a suspicious and intriguing new case comes up. The murderer kills a variety of different people and writes the name of the sin he feels they have committed on the wall of the murder site in whatever substance he happens to find at the time. For example, he writes GREED in blood, GLUTTONY in grease, etc.

SE7EN is mostly just your run-of-the-mill murder mystery story, a genre which I've never really been into. However, this movie is also different in a couple of ways. The story, for one, I find to be incredibly clever. The murderer's plan is highly original and almost makes sense, in an insane sort of way. Every move the murderer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), makes is just another step in his plan, and all lead up to the ending--which, I have to say, is absolutely brilliant.

I think what sets SE7EN apart from most murder mystery movies is that it requires you to think a bit more. Instead of simply showing the exciting parts of a detective's job, such as the chase scenes (and this movie has just one, but a particularly good one), it shows the long, tedious process of finding clues and investigating. I think this element brings the viewer deeper into the lives of all of the characters and instills more feelings and care for said characters. And though the murderer's plan is made clear, there are still a few foggy aspects that are required by that noggin to sort out.

As for technical aspects, everything works. Morgan Freeman is a great actor, and despite what some reviewers think, I have to say Brad Pitt is too. Both do well in this movie, as does Kevin Spacey as the ""deranged murderer freak."" The script is great, if a little watered down by some cliches, and the direction is excellent. No complaints.

To be honest, I wasn't truly impressed with SE7EN until the ending. It was a little cliched, a little boring, and a little tedious. But I think that's the idea--that contrast makes the ending that much more shocking and therefore more brilliant. The most perfect ending to a great crime thriller. 8.5/10.",9
20 July 2019,Astonishing,"I think the movie is unprecedented. My most interest part is the serial killer's dead. it means detective Mills losed. unlike the other movies, the killer killed 7 and believed in God who is insane. I think it's bloody to act a Crime like this.

14 August 1999,WOW Wonderfully Chilling,"This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. I was disappointed when this film was first released at the movies, because I was too young to go watch it, I would have enjoyed the movie going experience for Se7en.

But when I watched the movie for the first time, i was glued to the television screen, it was around 2 in the morning and i had the surround sound speakers doing their job, and for the next two hours i was enthrawlled in this deeply disturbing movie about a maticulous serial killer who patterned his murders according to the seven deadly sins, Gluttony, Sloth, Pride, Greed, Envy, Wrath and Lust.

The two detectives played flawlessly by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are dragged into the sick mind of the killer as murder upon murder piles up each posing their own little riddles for the pair to solve.

This movie, which was director David Fincher's first and writer Andrew Kevin Walkers finest is a thrilling ride which keeps you guessing all the way until the thrilling climax which will throw everyone for a loop.

Truly one of the greatest thrillers ever, I have watched it multiple times, and you know what I think i'll go watch it again.",8
20 March 2001,Intriguing crime drama,"Se7en is simply a great movie. It provides a unique motive for a

serial killer: to kill violators of the seven deadly sins. Is a person

justified in killing if doing it for the greater cause of society? Or

is it merely a veneer used to excuse morbid pleasures? Se7en discusses

this moral question. Besides the plot, he characters are not bad

either. Brad Pitt plays a defiant, rookie-like cop who partners with

the wise, veteran Morgan Freeman. Brad Pitt of course acts to the best

of his ability. It's too bad that he has achieved the taboo status of

being a heart-throb. Morgan Freeman though is respected for his great

roles in the past. The greatest part of the story ,though, is the ending which isn't

exactly a surprise but still is great how it ties the story together.

Another good attribute of the movie are the sets. They fulfill their

task of being depressing, dark, and just something that you'd see on a

rainy, dismal day in the city. Even the scenes in the large sunny

fields seem to be oddly depressing and dismal. Watch a great film: Se7en.",9
4 April 2020,Nice,"I have seen this film like a times and every time I watch it again it's as disturbing as the first time. It's always intriguing from start till finish.I think This is one of the best stories ever told on screen.

29 May 2002,fincher and pitt deliver,"this is such an amazing movie from top to bottom, i don't even know where to start. short of something truly god-like, this is the best script that will ever be written by andrew kevin walker. graphically violent, stylish and very crime noir-ish all at once without even coming close to cheesy. brilliantly directed by david fincher, who using his superb directorial skills by leaving the most depraved violence in the film up to the viewer's imagination, makes the crimes that much worse by showing graphic crimes committed making the one you dont see more graphic by comparison. brad pitt's best performance other than fight club. he and fincher have a special magic unseen between an actor and director in a long time. morgan freeman's best work outside of shawshank redemption. kevin spacey's best work outside of usual suspects, only due to the fact that he has way less screen time. another great score by howard shore. an excellent performance by r. lee ermey as the police chief. more masterful make-up by rob bottin. if you dont have this already, go out and buy yourself a copy. and get ready for a true cinematic gem.",10
16 October 2020,Some of the best Cinematography out there,"David Fincher (rightfully) gets a ton of praise for his work here but this film also features what *might* be the best work of cinematographer Darius Khondji -a living legend!

Through both shot direction and exquisite cinematography, the visuals help elevate this film to the top of its genre. Couple that with great performances and an incredibly sharp script and you might just have a masterpiece.

25 years later and this film can still be held up as an ideal blueprint of what a good thriller can be!

20 December 2001,twisted genius,"Considering how little gore is present, this has to be considered one of the best horror films ever. Kevin Spacey radiates pure evil and indeed he, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt all give top-notch performances. The hair raising suspenseful finale in the middle of nowhere with the trio and the horror-filled box makes me cringe with every viewing. This film has it all: great acting, great dialog, great cinematography, and much emotion.

4 February 2002,Have you sinned lately?,"""Se7en"" is one of the best horror, thriller, mystery movies I have seen in forever. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt work perfectly together and David Fincher put that movie together wonderfully. Recently I had not seen the movie but went ahead and bought the fairly expensive DVD. But I tell you it was worth every $25 of it. If theres one movie I could tell someone to go see right now, it would have to be ""Se7en"". A+

11 November 2020,A modern classic,"After Hitchcock's Psycho and Silence Of The Lambs, this is a true classic of the serial-killer thriller genre. Acting is very good (especially Morgan Freeman), but the directing is truly outstanding, and so is the writing. Honestly, almost every film and tv show nowadays attempt to copy Se7en, unsuccessfully. The dark atmosphere, tension, action, character development - it's all there, in the correct proportion. I just rewatched it, 25 years after it's been shot - even with knowledge of the plot and all the twists, much better than most films of the same genre presently.

7 June 1999,"Some may like it, I think it sucks","I may be the only person that feels this way, but Seven is a pretty lame movie. When I pay to watch an R rated suspense/thriller movie, I want my blood, guts, and action. This movie provided me with almost none of the above, with the exception of like three (come on, only three?) bloody dead people. OK, OK, the drug dealer on the bed was the best part. But the movie is SO SLOW and BORING. Sure, Morgan Freeman does a great job acting, but all the biblical psychobabble in the world doesn't make up for NOT SHOWING THE KILLER KILLING PEOPLE. I don't want to go off on a rant here, but having 2 cops walk around in the rain merely going into apartments for nearly two hours bores me to death. The ending was cool, but hardly makes up for this sad attempt. You want disturbing? You want a REALISTIC portrayal of violence in the mind of a serial killer? Forget watching Seven, watch Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. I dare you to watch both these movies and say Seven is better. On second thought, most of you wouldn't watch Henry because it's TOO real. You LIKE this watered-down mainstream pretty-boy nonsense. Oh, if you couldn't tell, I didn't like this movie.

4 January 2001,Best Ending I Have Ever Seen,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",
17 July 2009,Great serial-killer drama...,"Brad Pitt and especially Morgan Freeman were wonderful in this film. The plot was intriguing and the background score was also good. But after seeing quite a number of films with shocking endings I have to say I saw it coming. But still its a great film. Considering it was made in 1995, David Fincher did a tremendous job in making a visually stunning film. Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer was awesome in every way you can imagine. Definitely one of the best murder-mystery drama out there. Inspired by the seven deadly sins, the film follows two Cops, one on the verge of retirement and the other newly transfered as they try to solve the mystery behind the serial killing of various unrelated people. If you like crime drama, this film is a MUST WATCH.

27 February 1999,"A dark journey, literally","Seven is a movie that left its imprint on my mind for days. I remember being so shaken leaving the theater that I had trouble unlocking my car door, because my hands were shaking so bad. It's that frightening, not in its content but its message. It is not exaggerating to say that this film is lacking in any hope.

The movie tells the story of the last seven days in the career of a veteran homicide detective, name Will Somersett, played by Morgan Freeman in a brilliant performance. He is retiring after 30 years on the force, because he is simply tired of it. He has seen so much evil, so much hate and death and gore and trauma, that when he learns that his replacement asked to be transferred to his precinct (in a seedy section of a city I don't recall ever being given a name), he is amazed.

The cop that will replace him is David Mills (Brad Pitt), who defensively reminds Somersett of his background, that he worked in homicide for 5 years. ""Not here,"" says Somersett, and treats him like a rookie, because in all the ways that count, he still is. He still has hope, and still feels that he can make a difference, which is why he transferred here. Boy, will he be surprised.

Their first case proves Somersett's point. A very large man is found in his home, dead. He was forced to eat at gunpoint until he hemmoraged internally, then kicked in the stomach to finish the job. Another man is forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh, and a woman is savagely mutilated, then offered both a phone and sleeping pills, and allowed to choose whether to call for help or commit suicide.

This is not your average serial killer. Mills and most of the other cops believe the killer is simply brutally insane, but Somersett believes he is trying to send a message. What kind of message? Well, at the fat man's crime scene the word ""Gluttony"" is carved into a wall. Other murder scenes leave behind the words ""Pride"" and ""Greed"". ""The Seven Deadly Sins,"" intones Somersett. He knows a lot about this sort of thing because he spends his evenings at the library, reading Dante and Saint Thomas Aquinus. Mills is less educated, and has to rely on Cliff Notes to keep up.

The plot grows thicker as the killer leaves more clues, and more bodies in a trail that leads through many apartment buildings that seem to be behind in their electric payments; there hardly seems to be any light anywhere. It rains incessantly throughout most of the movie, until the climax, which I will not describe.

The movie is full of little details that add depth to otherwise small scenes. One example: a man who runs a whorehouse is brought in for questioning after another of the murders is discovered. In a lesser film he would have just been another slimy purveyor of cheap sex and kinky thrills, just to add a little color. Instead, he is asked if he likes his job. He answers by saying ""No, I don't."" He leans forward, and glares at the cop. ""But that's just life, isn't it?"" Not exactly standout dialogue but my point is the movie takes the time to flesh out even bit characters.

If I have made this movie sound dreary, bloodsoaked and hopeless, then I have described it well. It is all of these things, and intentionally so. To say that is not to criticize it; on the contrary, it is actually very well conceived and strongly acted. The plot is brilliantly set up, and the movie is not just a sick exploitation picture. Every murder takes place off-screen, save one. The filmmakers understand that it is scarier to see the aftermath of a killing than to actually see it happen. The movie has had a noticeable impact on television as well, shows such as Millennium and Profiler could be said to have been inspired by Seven.

Did I enjoy it? In a word, no. It is simply too dark, too staggeringly hopeless in it implications in the end that I cannot walk out of such a movie feeling like I ""enjoyed"" it. That is not to say I don't think it was a good movie. I admire its superior craftsmanship and its style. But afterward I felt like going someplace with lots of people and plenty of light.",
5 November 1999,the most disturbing movie I have ever seen,"I first saw the movie 4 years ago when it first came out, I thought the trailer looked horrifying and I thought maybe this movie would be nothing, but then I saw it, and it was way more disturbing than the preview. Pitt and Freeman are really good together in this one. The movie was good throughout and then when Spacey entered the flick he made it even better, even though he was only in it for about 20 minutes. He basically stole the show, he was the best bad guy I have ever seen to date. Right after the movie was over I was stunned all the way home, it scared me straight for awhile, and to this day I still haven't been able to forget the images of the film, this is one film that will stick with you for the rest of your life. Great flick!

3 June 2014,One of the best...,"One of the best roles Brad pitt had. I think this is the movie everyone need to see once at least. Every detail , every ""murder"" is perfect. Nowdays you just cant find a lot movies which can be watched just like on one breath take. Its one of the best thrillers iv seen. Perfect cast and OST. A lot of emotions. And just incredible ending. Environment in the movies are just perfectly matched. Like every directed movie by David Fincher its easy for eye to watch if you know what i mean. The grit and grime of the crimes scenes combined with filth of the city streets, alleyways, rooftops, constantly being pounded with rain, darkness engulf even the few happy moments of the film. So much of this film's beauty is in the compilation.

24 August 2023,A disturbing yet great film,"I really liked it suprisingly. Seeing it is not the type of genre I would normally watch and that I generally like but this film was really well done. It has a gripping and interesting storyline. I think the whole plot around the seven capital sins was really ingenious and made the story great. I love the beautiful dark cinematography and the screenplay is really intelligent. To add on top of that great performances from Morgan Freeman playing the detective and Brad Pitt as Mills. I also like how the film talks about a lot of murders but really not much is shown. Overall a disturbing yet really good film.

4 May 2005,Excellent Movie. More than one of the best cop-thrillers ever.,"Seven was magnificent. I can't believe I didn't know of it until now. My husband claims he didn't tell me about it because he wants to protect me from ""bad things"", which is very sweet, but I am so particular about movies that even something like a badly done ""romance"" or ""comedy"" will upset me and lets not even talk about annoying ""kiddie"" movies. I am rarely motivated to post a review of a movie: I will only do so if a movie is exceptionally good, or (I won't waste time on just an okay or mediocre or bad movie: those kinds of movies are the norm) if I have been lead to believe a movie would be good due to, say, excellent prequels and I ended up inexcusably let down by it.

Seven delivers. I don't know how else to sum it up. I have read the more recent comments of others and I am pleased to see quite a few of you know what your talking about. The effects: the lighting, the sound, music, the way the scenes and story was set up: pretty much everything is executed perfectly. And because of this the actors are able to exhibit their talents to the fullest of their capability.

Morgan Freeman has this way of saying things in such a believable way: he's a wonderful actor. Brad Pitt is extremely convincing and the supporting cast is the icing on the cake as far as acting goes in this movie. Everyone worked well together to make this movie great hence lots of credit needs to go to the writers, editors, visual effects, sound effects, soundtrack and overall vision of the Director (and I'm sure there's more I've left out).

To the person who criticized ""Saw"" for copying Seven: I had the displeasure of seeing Saw before I even knew of this movie and I thought to myself at the time: they could have done soooo much better with this. And you are completely correct. Saw isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is quite bad, and maybe something for one to see if one can obtain humor from bad acting (I like Danny Glover, but unfortunately the movie was bad. And Cary Elwes was over the top in the overacting department). See Saw everyone, if you're in the mood for somethin' a little freaky, and aren't in the mood to take a movie too seriously.

Seven seems real. It's fiction but... believable. And it is tastefully done, for being a movie about about killing, death, and dark things. People get disturbed for varying reasons of their own. Silence of the Lambs (again to the person who was writing about Saw copying Seven) is excellent, but I don't watch it too often because I get too disturbed by it. Seven is a little different because the movie sets it up so that at least in my opinion, there is less of a sympathy factor for some of the victims-SOME, I stress. I can't go into further detail without risking spoiling the movie for anyone else who might be reading this but those who have seen the movie, maybe you'll know what I mean. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie for those who want to see a dark, disturbing...profound and meaningful thriller.",10
13 December 2001,keeps you guessing,"This was/is a fantastic movie. They don't come much better than this. I was actually hesitant to rent it after missing it at the theatre and hearing so much about it from everyone. Fortunately,I didn't hear anything to ruin it for me and finally did end up getting it. The story is so completely original and the acting is above board also. I wish there were as well thought out and acted as this one,instead we get stuck with garbage like 'Not Another Teen Movie' and the like. If only Hollywood would get back to art,rather than the almighty dollar...

21 January 2013,Stupid B serial killer movie from the 90's got a big hype,"That's how I record that movie.. it would be considered a B movie if it was made with a low budget and not so famous actors.. the plot is pure non-sense.. it is one of those super serial killer kind of movie.. which I simply hate with all my soul.. really stupid and annoying plot.. it is really a hard task to watch to the end.. and what a stupid end. I'd like to say something good about this movie.. it is the first time I saw Gwineowlh Patrowl (I spelled her name correctly?? hehehe). When you have a good budget you can find those mega beautiful actress out of nothing :)

What else to say? Unfortunately the super serial killer kind of movie got a really success in the 90's.. B movies such as The silence of the lambs got a really wagon full of retards wanting to praise it.. I know one day it will end.. but unfortunately it isn't over yet..

5 February 2001,Perfect!,"My friends think I'm insane, but I rate this one higher than Silence of the Lambs (the movie Se7en is most compared with). It's much darker and has a lot more atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, Silence... was a fantastic movie, but Se7en is in my opinion the best serial killer film ever!

Everybody has seen the cliche of a retiring officer who's working in a rookie a thousand times (and more) and that's probably the only flaw this masterpiece has. It's a dark (and rainy!) look at the seven deadly sins which have become just another piece of our lives and there are no innocent souls on this planet left (according to John Doe). Everybody is guilty!

The movie takes you with one surprise after another to the ending. The ending is the best part of the film (I've seen enough films to know this is does not happen often), when the detectives and their killer find the two other victims.

Special nods towards the cinematography (which is excellent) and the producers decision to not show the name of the actor playing the 'bad guy' in the opening credits.

This film is a must see for everybody who wants to see... No, just for everybody!",10
16 February 2012,I think it is one of those significantly overrated movies....,"Awesome acting performances by Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey too; reminded me of his role in THE USUAL SUSPECTS. But, in spite of such high quality performances, and some fantastic screenplay and editing, nothing could make me deny the fact that the script was just average & not anything more than that. Although the climax was ""gut-wrenching"", as called by few, it was not at all so much worth watching. I came through this movie, after having watched a lot of movies of the genre of crime-mystery-thriller. I think such movies can be made far better, by adding some kind of twists at the ending. The one given in this movie was not essentially a twist; it was just something to add 2 more to the 5 sins to make it Seven. I'm not at all telling that its a bad movie.One can rate it 8/10 but obviously not 8.7. And you know there's quite a lot difference between 8 and 8.7, here at IMDb. Movies like The Usual Suspects, Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, etc. are better.

1 July 2014,An unsettling descent into Fincher's world of crime.,"One of the most endearing aspects of Se7en is the dark atmosphere in which it is set. From the get-go, an uneasy tension is created through the way in which the crimes unfold. This tension is able to drag viewers in, but most importantly, is maintained and even built upon throughout the course of the film. Eventually it leads to one of the most climactic endings seen in a thriller film for years.

David Fincher's visuals, along with the performances of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman (whose characters are written by Andrew Walker), aid in the immersion of this gritty, yet strangely poetic film - an experience you won't forget.

25 October 2004,"It's one of the best (if not, the best) thrillers of the nineties simply because it does what most thrillers rarely do: it has a point.","****MEGA SPOILERS WARNING****

Detective William Somerset is in the last seven days of his career in New York City homicide. He is to spend those seven days showing his replacement, Detective David Mills the ropes. The first crime scene the pair is sent to investigate is truly a bizarre one, a hugely obese shut-in has eaten himself to death, and is found face-down in a plate of spaghetti. Somerset insists that no one would take the time force a man to eat himself to death unless the act itself has meaning that this must be the beginning of something.

He asks to be reassigned and is refused. Mills asks if he can have the case and is also refused. Mills' next case is equally bizarre, a lawyer is found in his office having bled to death after being forced to cut off a pound of his own flesh. The word ""Greed"" has been written in his blood on the carpet. Meanwhile, Somerset returns to the fat man's apartment and finds that the word ""Gluttony"" has been written in the grease behind the refrigerator.

Aha! Somerset realizes what's going on, a serial killer is killing his victims based on the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Both of the men realize that the killer won't stop his brutal killings until he methodically and creatively executes his victims until his final vision is realized and is remembered, and studied forever.

One thing is for sure, this movie is not for the queasy, but apart from that one caveat, I can't recommend it highly enough. The acting by Freeman and Pitt is what makes this movie one of the greatest crime thrillers of all time. It's stellar! Crime movies don't get any better than this, folks. The mystery is clever enough to keep you guessing all the way to the last five minutes of the movie. The direction by Fincher is great, the city has never seemed more oppressive or dark.

The soundtrack by Howard Shore I believe is another reason why this thriller ranks above all the rests and sits up with The Silence Of The Lambs. On another note, Kevin Spacey turns in a truly memorable cameo. In fact, it's better than most lead roles people are giving now a days. He plays a truly disturbed person, and one that you know must be insane. Just in this movie alone, Spacey proves he is one of the finest actors today.

What sold me on this film and just how damn disturbing and dark it is. It's quite amazing. I've yet to see a film that can match next to the upcoming, soon to be classic, ""Saw"". How the film didn't get recognized by the Academy Awards is beyond me. I can't wait to see a movie matches the dark, disturbing and down right brutal way the film plays modern society as place where no one will get away with their sins, and the punishment is unbearable.

19 July 2014,Blew my mind,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9
23 April 2022,"Tense, scary and unsettling","This is the first David Fincher film I've seen and damn, what a first impression. Seven is one of if not the best detective story I've ever seen put to film. The film's tone and atmosphere is fantastic and the characters are superbly written and acted.

To start, the cinematography, sound and score all contribute to a miserable atmosphere. The city in which the characters inhabit feels like a hellhole where colour has all but been erased and everyone is morally grey. The effects work is also superb. Each murder victim is shown with horrifying, stomach churning detail that will haunt one's nightmares for a long time.

The plot is very well-paced and the mysteries surrounding the main killer are beautifully constructed. It is so satisfying watching it all come together in a masterful climax that left me stunned.

The only morally good character in this movie is probably Detective Somerset, played excellently by Morgan Freeman. However, his character is more of an audience point of view/narrator of the story. Yet the audience understands who he is and his aged retiring but experienced detective persona contrasts wonderfully with Brad Pitt's young and emotionally driven David Mills. Pitt gives it his all here and he goes through an emotional journey that is ultimately the core of this film. These two characters carry the movie and there is a third key character that I will not spoil for those seeing the movie for the first time. Sufficed to say the actor did a brilliant job in the little screen time he had.

Overall, Seven is a fantastic movie with twists and turns that will keep the viewer guessing. The atmosphere and tone is assisted by a tense score by Howard Shore and it has some of the best/most disgusting effects I've ever seen that will send viewers shivering.",9
4 July 2023,What's in the Box?,"I'm not really a movie buff. I don't watch many movies, but I appreciate their content. Even if I like what they are trying to say, it bothers me when they are presented as movies because I think movies are very boring. I mean, I think they usually don't have enough content to fill 2 hours and 15 minutes, which results in an artificial filling and we watch empty walking scenes under the name of ""detail"". For this reason, people think and guess what will happen next in this free time and lose the excitement factor. Movies don't have to be two hours long, but I don't know what standard that is, but because of that standard, they last so long that they start to get boring. Especially in a detective movie, I think boredom is an unforgivable punishment.

But Se7en is not such a movie. It's a movie that always keeps the excitement high. If you were told about the concept of this movie right now, it might sound a bit normal, but I think it was not bad for '95 and even relatively interesting. However, the movie is definitely exciting, and as soon as you realize that you can guess some parts and start to analyze the movie, the movie surprises you and tells you that you can't read it so easily. I have to admit that especially towards the end I got excited and wanted to watch the movie at normal speed, which is very rare for me. The movie is definitely far from the boringness I mentioned in the above paragraph.

Even though I don't know much about the technical details, I think the more I watch a movie, the more I see good and bad examples, the more easily I can notice the flaws and beauties. I especially liked the color palette of this movie. It's a shooting technique with muted colors that can very well reflect the gloominess of the place where the events take place, and I can definitely say that I liked it. I also liked the shots and I can't fault the acting.

It was really a beautiful and exciting movie. I don't know if it's a must-see, but I think it's a movie that can be easily watched and liked in every environment.",8
14 August 2013,Brilliant,"Absolutely stunning film! This film serves as what a true suspenseful thriller should be. There are a lot of crap films out there and its nice to see a rare film that is Oscar worthy.

Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey carry this film strongly. Of course Brad Pitt is very good too and so is the small part that Gwen Paltrow plays.

I swear everything this film does you have never seen done before. Blows your mind all the new twists and turns.

If you want originality and scares this film is for you. Not much else to say

12 October 1998,This film deserves a place among the classics,"This is without doubt the best suspense/thriller/horror movie I have ever seen. I was in shock days after seeing it the first time and still today after seeing it the fourth time I am deeply touched by this film. At the end of the movie I really wanted to scream in order to do something with my frustration.

And you will get frustrated over this movie, because it has no happy ending, no justice and no redemption. It will leave you with a big, bleeding hole in your heart.

And that is what I love about this movie. It does not aim to please. It aims to tell you a disturbing story about human disintegration and it sticks with that. There are no cliches or displaced love and affection. You as the viewer can either love or hate it but you cannot be ignorant about it. If this movie has had a happy ending I would have been very disappointed, but fortunately it does not. Thank you Mr. Fincher for making this contribution to mankind. Rating: 10 of 10.",10
9 August 1999,"Hey, Brad Pitt was in a great movie!","Great script, great performances by Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman (especially him) and Gwyneth Paltrow. Great suspense and action sequences. Superb ending that not only ties the whole film together but also enhances everything shown up to that point. Great intelligence, creativity and imagination. Sure, it's a twisted imaginitive mind that wrote this, but it is a great, great script. Be warned, the film does get gruesome in some points, but is always superb.

Who knew Brad Pitt would actually make a great film without looking like a superstar model throughout?

14 September 2014,If you love SAW you will love this...,"Now I'm no hater of violence in films and I rather enjoy a good horror.

The two leads are both actors I usually enjoy and they both give good performances is this.

The film making and camera work in this film are very, very good.

It's well acted and I think the director and script writers got the film they wanted.

So what is the reason I have scored this a ""2""?

Well it's ""torture porn"", it may even be the first of the current seemingly never ending proliferation of titles and I just can't see the attraction on on-ending suffering and pain as the subject of a film. The only reason for such films seems to me to show increasingly nasty ways of maiming and killing people. If that kind of film is what you enjoy then watch this as it is certainly better made and acted than most of the genre, but it's not for me.",2
1 October 2021,A mystery with a twist,"I saw this movie because it was recommended for people who want to see something with a twist.

The end of the movie is predictable, but it's always a surprise.

It's been aired on TV, but no matter how many times I watch it, it always gives me a chill.

30 September 2012,Se7en Review,"Now I have seen this movie over 100 times and I have never gotten tired of it. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the role of their lives in this movie. David Fincher's ability to make a gritty police film such as this is amazing. Brad Pitt plays a rookie detective called David Mills. He is assigned a job with William Somerset(Morgan Freeman). Here they go through a series of killings by a person known only as John Doe who uses the 7 deadly sins as his MO. After watching this film over 100 times shows that great films like this are dying. Se7en shows that a great film can leave a footprint on cinema history. This is why i am giving Se7en 9 out of 10

12 July 2002,NOT SINCE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS...,"I first saw parts of ""Seven"" a few years ago, edited, on Fox. I dismissed it as a film with only the intent to shock, and as a film with no meaning other than an unintentional celebration of violence and gore. I did walk away from the film with my stomach turned inside out, and with certain scenes from the film (fans can guess which ones) playing over and over in my head, but I felt that the film didn't have the core or the heart or the meaning to make it a masterpiece. After recently watching it again, I have changed my mind completely. Although I still feel it isn't a masterpiece, in the same ranks as ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Psycho,"" I do feel it can very well be compared to these greats. I think ""Seven"" is just as good a film than ""Cape Fear,"" another famous thriller, both the original and the remake, and better than almost all thriller films I have ever seen. I will admit that not since ""The Silence of the Lambs"" have I been so fascinated by a thriller--I loved everything about ""Seven"" from the grizzly and brutal corpse make-up to Kevin Spacey's short but brilliant act as John Doe, a serial murderer. I thought that the sets were fabulous, possibly the best I've ever seen. I thought the acting was good enough to completely change my opinions on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, both of whom I previously felt to be non-talents. Both the climax of the movie as well as the ending moments were so well done I had chills running down my spine, unable to move my fixed eyes--even though I knew the ending from previously seeing parts of the film, I was still completely caught up in the story--I was still anxious, fearful, sad, curious, and on the edge of my seat the entire time. This film brings you into the true-life world of a serial killer and his victims. It doesn't even stop to consider simplicity or suggestive filmmaking--it shows you every little sick detail. This in-your-face method really almost makes you feel disgusted, but you can't take your eyes away. I loved how Fincher wonderfully showed the parallels between not only Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman's character's, but between their job and how they each deal with it. I can't say enough about this movie without spoiling it or making this review unreadable due to how unorganized it is, but I do recommend this very intelligent thriller--if you have the stomach for it.",
11 March 2010,Go see this one!,"I always get excited to see serial killers movies, even when they're bad, it's a very entertaining and complex genre and always gets my attention. But what makes ""Se7en"" so great?

In it's first sequence we are introduced to William Somerset (Freeman), an old and quiet Detective that is indignant because of how decadent and violent his city has become. Now let me say that the only mistake of the movie is that it tries to tell us how hopeless humanity has become, but it is not true, it's so not true, that they never mention the name of the city they are in, if it's NY, they would have to show the charm and beautiful NY, if they were talking about California, they would hake to show all that Californian glamour, the one that looks more like the city of the movie is Vegas, but then again, they would have to show the rich part of it, there's just no town as decadent as that one.

Now let's talk about it's good parts, and they are not few, every single thing in this movie is very well explained, which is admirable in some movies, and in others not, but it's great in this one because it makes you wait, not only for the final part, but for every scene you're watching, it grabs you in a way that deserves applause.

The acting is not brilliant, but great, except for Spacey's outstanding one, that gives the character an air of superiority and serenity that make him sound even reasonable sometimes. If the movie didn't have an ending it would already be great, but not happy with that, Andrew Kevin Walker and David Fincher made one of the most shocking ending you'll ever see, that image burns so deeply in my mind that when I remember, it gives me goosebumps.

Verdict: This dark, gory and complex picture will stay in your mind forever... Now, stop what you're doing, and go see this one!",9

9 June 2004,Poignant social comment via the medium of film,"Overall, Seven is an excellent film. It is highly enjoyable in the sublime sense, in that despite being a film of great darkness combined with graphic depictions of murder, there is in fact a very poignant social comment at the end that arises from it all. The central underlying theme of the film is how society seems to turn a blind eye to the seven deadly sins it commits on a daily basis, and how a highly intelligent serial killer commits a series of brutal murders to expose this and voice his discontent with this matter.

Initially, it starts with a seemingly standard murder mystery type plot, though the brutal ways in which the victims are murdered is quite unprecedented in a film of this genre, and the production design also gives the film a certain historic/period atmosphere which aids in setting itself apart from the norm.

As the film progresses, each murder appears to get more gruesome and horrible than the one before. At times during the first one and half hours of the film then the pace gets a little slow, although this in fact can be seen as a build up towards what becomes one of the greatest endings in film history.

The most poignant part of the film occurs when Jon Doe is explaining the rationale behind his murder 'masterpiece' to the two detectives whilst in the car near the end. He explains that he was chosen to commit this crime (even though Somerset replies that this would fly in the face of martyrdom). He says that he cannot tolerate the fact that deadly sins are committed 'on every street corner' and people just tolerate it and go on living their normal lives. He therefore uses murder as a means of exposing the fact that we live in a society which in fact is sinister, sinful, and 'shitty' as Doe puts it. Here, the dialogue is exquisite, and every word that Doe utters seems to have been carefully thought out by him (the character). He is, as he says, 'knocking society in the face with a sledge hammer' to try and make people aware just how much they are in fact going against the lord and the bible. Doe can therefore be seen as man who wishes to initiate new values in society. He illustrates each of the sins by murdering sinners of each sin e.g.the lawyer who lied to keep rapists and murderers on the street to make lots of money (that's not hugely sympathetic to the law profession, i.e.all lawyers are sinful!!)is an illustration of greed.

The film is therefore a very clever social comment on quite a controversial and difficult matter. As society has become increasingly secularized, to commit a deadly sin is not such a meaningful or 'sinful' thing as it used to be, although in the extreme sense that Doe illustrates it as(e.g. lust's disease spreading whore) such sins (but not necessarily in the biblical sense) are still massively relevant to contemporary society.

Overall, therefore, it has an extremely cleverly thought out plot, superb acting from all the cast, and makes for a very thought-provoking piece of cinema.

Overall Rating: 9/10",

17 August 2013,Great Movie,"A thrilling and shocking film. It's captivating with a genius story line. I can't imagine how anyone could dislike it, no matter what genres you prefer. It's really one of my favorites. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys watching crime and mystery. And of course, the amazing actors who are perfect for their roles played in the movie. One of their best performances to date, in my opinion. I'd almost compare it to The Silence of the Lambs, because of it's dark events and shocking outcomes. This films also a psychological thriller and leaves you thinking once it's over. If you've yet to check it out, you should do so right away. I give it a ten out of ten, mainly because of the creepy setting and very original plot.

18 December 2009,sensational and memorable,"A highly effective mix of brooding atmosphere, schlock parody and cop-movie that is given its thrills by its intriguing premise about a serial killer committing his crimes based on the seven deadly sins. The narrative moves efficiently along providing the necessary shock moments and the work of everyone involved shows a happy center, but it is Fincher's directorial touch that gives the film its sensational and memorable aspects. I cannot fail to point out, however, that the film has been strangely overrated over the years, even being compared to that other excursion into the schizo realms, ""Silence Of The Lambs"". It is not ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it can surely be appreciated for what it is: A graphic Lovecraft-like tale set in a gritty world.

The tension was higher when two actors sitting in an empty room talking than all of Arnie's movies put together. All the actors were supereb, filled with creativity and wonderful watchable energy. I have to credit the screenwriter for creating a wonderful structure to all ow the actors to do their job effortlessley. The director maintained a sense of consistency that served make this film brilliant. Films like this one that brings you back to the movie theatre. Good job.

12 February 1999,"Great, suspenseful, gruesome thriller - a classic","An accomplished thriller from a great director, David Fincher. Falls into essentially two parts - in part one, veteran detective Morgan Freeman and cocky upstart Brad Pitt team up to catch a serial slayer with a biblical bent.

Part two turns this formulaic thriller premise on its head leading the detectives into a completely stunning, shocking, kick-you-in-the-nuts terrific ending.

Fincher has created a stylish, intentionally ugly look that transcends the pulp narrative. Deeply philsophical and provocative, featuring a very satisfying and memorable finale, with outstanding direction, excellent performances by Freeman, Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and especially Kevin Spacey, who consolidates his position as Hollywood's preeminent character player by playing the creepiest psycho since John Lithgow in BLOW OUT.

10 September 2000,Seen on recommendation of IMDb viewer comments,"This is the first movie I have seen based solely on the viewer comments I have found on IMDb. I'm not sure how I became aware of this film on IMDb, possibly by its high rating. The comments were positive, but I was promised a great ending. I found the movie to be more of the same ghoulishness which passes for entertainment these days. It was not my cup of tea, or, in this case, blood. Whatever possesses writers to dream up this stuff is beyond me, I'm pleased to say. This is the first film I have seen by this writer and director, and although the combo did better, in my opinion, than the ""American Beauty"" combo, there is nothing there to encourage me to see another film by either. This was also the first time I have seen Brad Pitt, who looks like my nephew, and he wasn't good at all. I'll will give long consideration to going out of my way to see any film from the 1900's or 2000 on the recommendation of such comments.

""SE7EN"" combines a sophisticated, crime plot, with a fun, heavy-metal type quality lingering in the background. The atmosphere is grim and unsettling: perfect and delicious.

But that's just the beginning...

Personally, I hated the killer. I thought he/she was annoying and typical. Also, I think that screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker made a mostly unnoticeable but wounding mistake: the killer is ""out in the open"" for too long. I think that his/her mysticism, which kept tension for the first hour and a half, was the coolest thing going, but it was killed in the end, like a vampire burning in the open sun.

28 April 2009,The best nail-biting thriller till date,"Se7en is a film released in 1995 which shows that a serial killer is on the prowl for 7 persons possessing the following sins: lust,greed,gluttony,pride,envy,wrath and sloth and starring performance oriented actors like Brad Pitt,Morgan Freeman,and Kevin Spacey.

Two detectives,Pitt(David Mills) and Freeman(William Somerset) are hired to investigate the case and hunt down the serial killer. Mills,being the arrogant cop and Somerset,more of the mature one.The plot has been cleverly written and will keep you engrossed right till the end.The cinematography is of the highest quality and the tight script writing will keep you guessing.

Brad Pitt puts in a sincere performance as David Mills and gives able support to Morgan Freeman who completely overshadows Pitt and delivers one of the most brilliant performances of his career as William Somerset.The surprise package of the movie has to be Kevin Spacey who is given limited screen presence but yet delivers a haunting and moving performance.But credit has to be given to David Fincher who has worked hard on each aspect of the film and directed this movie brilliantly. One of the highlights of the film is the seven murders being showcased on the screen perfectly.The climax is one of the best you will ever see in American cinema and will keep you thinking about it for days.",10
18 January 2020,Quite an experience,"This movie is not for the faint of heart...or stomach. Wonderful movie.

8 October 2009,My favorite movie of all time for a number of different reasons,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

2 September 2013,One of the best Horror/Thrillers in the past 25 years,"There are very few horror movies that have come out in the past twenty-five years that manage to deliver on the ""horror"" front without resorting to taking the gore over the top, or playing all of the lowest common denominator cards. Se7en is the exception to the rule. It's most bone chilling moments are dialogue driven, and plot progression is what packs the punches, not formulaically placed ""one-up"" death sequences. The story is personable (which is one of the best ways to increase the thrill factor), it's production is exemplary, and it's message is deep-cutting. An ace on all fronts. Movies like Se7en are a rare commodity these days. There are too many variables in on the production side to allow for ""perfect 10"" results upon release. But it's possible that this is what allows movies of a higher caliber have a greater impact. There is a sense of victory that gets mixed in with the stew of other pleasing emotions that movies like this evoke. Victory over the variables. Se7en is definitely one of the survivors. Despite the odds, Se7en is a perfect 10.

27 April 2020,Everything comes from desire,"There are no perfect people, and the seven deadly sins are just a summary, not only the seven, but these seven deadly sins are not deadly, but human nature, ""greedy eating"", children understand that people take food as the heaven It is the instinct that humans must have. ""Lust"" is also human instinct. It is just that we humans have feelings and use sex as the promotion of love, but we cannot but admit that sex is our normal need like eating. If ""eating"" and ""sex"" are the most basic needs and instincts of human nature, the following five items exceed a height. From the perspective of spirit and thinking, ""original sin"", ""greedy"", greed comes from desire, desire is a difficult When you do n't know what you need and what you need is enough, this thing called desire will prompt you to want more and demand more, and greed will be born from then on. The root of laziness is rest, and rest is necessary, but when deeply immersed in greed and pleasure, laziness also unconsciously occurs. Arrogance is too self-focused, self-centered, and self-centered. Jealousy and anger are both sources and foreign affairs, which cause internal imbalances and gaffes. Everyone has seven sins, because these are the ""original sins"" of human nature. We can't stop and change them. Although they are named as sins, sins are not lethal. Carefully, it is often not those who are hurt by these ""sins"". But myself.",10

18 May 2020,A real skin crawler.,"A tantalisingly morbid psychological/thriller that steadily increases the gloom factor as the plot progresses.

The screeching nail on chalkboard remix of 'Nine inch Nails' by Closer coupled with the spliced images of John Doe removing his fingertips immediately disconcerts.

The entire film is brimming with rich cinematography, atmospheric torrential rain and exquisite attention to detail.

The friction between Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman's characters is the driving force of the plot, and Gwyneth Paltrow shines as the only unblemished character who radiates light and laughter (in only one scene of the entire film).

John Doe (the killer) rarely loses composure during the films entirety. Egotistical; cunning, highly intelligent and sadistic - he is fixated on forced attrition. Though delusional, he does garner a degree of respect for his dedication (he tortured some of his victims for more than a year) and execution of the murders - each one is more symbolic than the next. In one scene, he scoffs at the detectives branding his victim as innocent people, and what's terrifying about his monologue is that most of it is true. (without sounding too apathetic)

What is artful about this film is that we never witness the murders. Like the detectives, we arrive at the scene. Every frame is dimly lit (pitch black at times) & the only glimpse we see of the victims is from the detectives torches. The 'Lust' scene is one of the most disturbing moments for me. Leland Orsers hysterical performance still gives me the most awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.

Howard Shore's score just racks up the films uncomfortable mood x 100, especially in the final scene (Wrath).

The ending is a piece of cinematic genius, and totally unmissable. One of the greatest endings I've ever seen - it will leave you reeling. (you'll be grasping onto the hypnotic sound of Somerset's metronome to drown out the sheer horror of this film.)",10
30 May 2020,A classic film.,"This is a very classic film, and it is worth seeing by everyone.Many later new crime films and crime novels have been parodied and adapted.In these works, I can see the shadow of this classic film.Finally, I want to say that the fat man is too miserable.

13 November 2013,It's no House of Cards buts Spacey is incredible,"Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt are obviously just another classic white / black duo of two butting personalities. Once the sexual tension is relieved midway through the film they both realize they are in for a treat emotionally when they encounter a villain that rivals Joe Pesci in Home Alone 2. With no Macauley Caulkin to booby trap a cunning bastard these two are left to play clue until the tragic end of themselves & their faith in Christianity. Yet hold the phone there is still hope, as we have seen in the comeback of Ben Affleck after making the film Gigli, Morgan remains astute even in the faltering of the human soul in villains & heroes because we see him later in life as the head of Wayne enterprises. All in all this movie reiterates that life goes on, unless you have committed suicide or are in fact in purgatory.

10 June 2014,review on Se7en,"The movie Se7en tells the story of two homicide detectives, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman), who try to solve seven mysterious murders. All the seven murders are committed very sadistically as the victims are badly mutilated. The mutilations have the purpose of symbolizing the seven deadly sins described in the Bible. David Mills is the new homicide detective and he is aided by the soon to retire William Sommerset. The difference between old 'veteran' Sommerset and 'rookie' Mills brings quite some conflicts in the beginning, but eventually the both of them agree that if they want to catch the killer, they will have to work together and make use of each other's strengths. The movie takes some major twists and turns at the end, and this does contribute to giving the movie a satisfying ending.

We think Se7en is a good movie. The story behind the murders with the seven sins connected to it makes you think, whether or not the murders were really that bad, or did the victims (sort of) deserve it? Asking yourself this question is the result of the strong movie, as you would normally not even consider if a murder was right or not. As mentioned before, the movie builds up to the end, which does live up to the expectations created by the rest of the film, as the ending is just as dramatic and well done as the other parts of the film, which leaves you with a satisfied feeling.

Editing plays a very big and important role in the production of movies, and this movie is no exception. Basically, everything that is even slightly altered from the recorded parts is included in the category editing. Editing therefore is making changes in filmed fragments, and putting these changed fragments together to form a fluent and pleasant to watch movie. An editor therefore has to make a lot of decisions. What parts should he choose to put together to create the right feeling and to satisfy the producer? why should he choose these? Etc. Editing, however, is not just used to make the movie look good or catchy, it's also used to give the audience a certain feeling, imprinted in their minds by the director. In this way, the director can set the experience of the movie to his hand.

Using things such as different lighting, camera height, music and shot length, the movie directors can give the audience certain opinions about the characters without even having the character say a single word. Characters with power are often filmed from a low perspective, as this symbolizes them being greater than you. Meanwhile, meaner or evil characters often have a darker glow around them and different background music, because this creates tension. Difference in Shot length shows a difference in the amount of energy used. The shorter the shots, the more energy is in the actions. For example, in a shooter, shots constantly change from one to the other, whereas in a love-story, the shot length is way longer, to make it more romantic and lovable.

This movie includes a lot of dramatic and painful scenes, wherein the director made use of a range of different shot transitions, to highlight the different amounts of tension in the scenes. In order to make sure that the message is communicated to the audience, they use longer shots and they pause between the monologues. In this way, the audience is forced to think about what's being said and what the message of the movie is. When energetic and active scenes are concerned, the director chose for short shot length, and fast shot transitions, in order to give the scenes more speed.

The film was shot in a way that is uncommon in popular films. It was shot in a special way using special lighting, making lots of shadows and silhouettes. The film was then edited with a process called C.C.E, which enhances the quality of the lights, making the dark parts darker and the light parts whiter. This alteration from the original is permanent.

Most of the colors used are shades of black and grey, so that parts of the images with primary colors (red, yellow and blue) stand out in contrast. In this way, red is often used, because this reminds the people of blood. The colors of this movie have a fakish look. This way, the viewer gets the impression that they watch a coloured-in black and white movie. This sequence is called neo-Gothic, and in my opinion fits well with the story and the rest of the movie, wherein mainly darker colors are used which corresponds with the dark murder theme.

Although this is a pretty rad movie, sometimes scenes can get a bit too slow for our taste. This made us lose track of the story a bit, halfway through, and as a result we had to rewind some parts, to understand them. I have given this movie some thought and can conclude that the directors and producers made an excellent decision regarding the choosing of the actors starring this movie. Morgan Freeman is perfectly able to capture dramatic moments, making the viewers feel sympathy for the actor, and thus making them follow the story better. Likewise we think Brad Pitt is well chosen too, because he is highly experienced with action and shooting scenes. Furthermore, the storyline isn't as linear as one would expect from a crime thriller. On the one hand it's a straightforward murder mystery, but on the other hand there are loads of plot twists to make the movie more interesting and challenging to understand.

We think it's a highly interesting movie. We would definitely recommend this movie, because it is an highly enjoyable and interesting story, and the way they made use of the different kinds of filming editing gives this story even more tension when needed.",10
24 January 2020,"A very strong crime thriller, but not as intense and thrilling as it could have been","This movie does nearly everything well but for some reason it doesn't captivate me as much as many other crime thrillers. I think what's missing is intensity and thrilling moments in the first and second act of the movie and this made me lose a little focus. With that being said, the story is very interesting and original, and the ending is absolutely fenomenal in how it wraps up the mystery in a very shocking and emotional way.

Brad Pitt's and Morgan Freeman's characters are very well written and dynamic. They both have compelling and intriguing character arcs that evolves them in logical ways. This is delivered wonderfully through their fantastic acting. Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Palthrow are also good in this film but they're not the stars of the show.

Other good things about the movie is the score and the set design. The score isn't particularly prominent but it delivers the few times it's in focus. The set designs are an important part of the story and feeling of the film and this is also done really well, it never dissapoints.

In summary, a very very strong crime thriller, but not as intense and thrilling as it could have been",9
15 March 2003,Slow and Predictable,"I notice this film is highly regarded by a lot of viewers. I, on the other hand, was not impressed with the story, pace, acting among these heavyweights or most anything else. I liked the little surprise ending - but I knew damn well that he was going to pull that trigger. Who wouldn't? It's just another serial killer flick, and not a very interesting one. Sorry.

19 April 2007,good,"It wasn't good....It was great!!!! remarkable performances,Morgan Freeman at his best,simply brilliant!!! Gwyneth Paltrow doing a role like few women would have succeed in this type of movies,and Brad Pitt was pretty good too(despite not liking him...)I fell the need to glue my eyes to the screen,this movie filled me up right from the beginning!! fine acting,fine plot,great effects,the timeline sequence of every event was completely flawless,and why not? Everyone should learn something about their morals with this movie,even the more obvious lesson, being obsessive in order to avoid the seven sins may be a sin itself. And when a movie teaches you something to make you evolve,and at the same time you enjoy and spend some quality time I think I can say that the goal of the movie was accomplished,they have set up the bar very high,but still,they managed to live up to the hype...which makes this movie a classic...1996...It seems like I saw it yesterday...

21 November 2018,Film Liquet on Se7en,"Two homicide detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) are investigating the case of a serial killer, as one of them is about to retire (Morgan Freeman), whilst the other has just transferred to the precinct and is only starting out (Brad Pitt). This neo-noir, set in the gritty, grey-looking New York, begins with the character of Brad Pitt entering a crime scene to introduce himself to his new partner, Morgan Freeman, however their first interaction proves to be quite cold, as the 'old dog' does not warm up to the newbie. Furthermore, they are assigned a mysterious homicide case, in which the killings are linked to the Seven Deadly sins. The film starts off with a series of Fincheresque shots, establishing the morning routine of the detective, then transitioning into a unique introduction title sequence of the film, which focuses our attention on minor details of the shots. It throws us into the action, the music straight away portrays the films as a tense crime thriller, in which the murder scenes send shivers down your spine and make you tense up, expecting a jump scare after every musical build up, keeping the viewer on edge during all times, grabbing our attention and not letting go throughout. However, even though Fincher's masterpiece retains the status of a must-watch, the film is more of a stylistic piece, showing off the director's way of seeing things, it might have been better with more content and ironically 'suffers from the sin of self-consciousness' (Malcolm D.; The Guardian, Seven, 04/01/1996). By my opinion it is also one of Morgan Freeman's best performances in a film.",8
7 May 2011,"Movie #1 (Format: DVD, Widescreen)","Last Thoughts First: Cinema attracts all forms of oddballs, don't it? Why anyone with any notion of The Bible or sin sits through a film like this is anyone else's guess- but who has time to play games? ME! People who could need a film like this to tell them anything about the world we live in or confirm what they already believe are only useful to this movie in, hopefully, having bought a ticket or copy of the home video. I on the other hand am such a freeloader- I first saw this on VHS, borrowed a copy from someone else who paid the rental fee. And this morning, I watched it on DVD- again, not my copy and I've never paid to rent it.

The Movie: Morgan Freeman is always intelligent and thoughtful, that's his gimmick. He's the real star of the movie, yet he doesn't get top billing because he isn't white- like international heartthrob, Brad Pitt. Pitt is always obnoxious and annoying, even when he's playing a whiny vampire. I'm not much of a fan of either. They're both still doing their gimmicks. But only one of them annoys me. Surprisingly, it's the one who plays the guy who's always on some kind of sugar rush / caffeine high. Does his character Mills have ADHD or something? Either way, I don't care. I get it, he can't control himself and expects others to do it for him; he needs to shut up or simmer down. They're the hard-boiled detectives covering the case of The 7-Sins Killer - my nickname for the guy, not something you hear in the movie. The movie's too busy with actor gimmicks. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the same sweet-hearted pretty blonde chick she always is. That guy who's always on The Military Channel actually plays a fairly perceptive chief / commissioner type- although he has the single dumbest line in the movie (the ""Southern Baptist upbringing"" quip). Kevin Spacey plays a fanatic, which we all know he's good at. And Scrubs' John C. McGinley plays a skinheaded SWAT team psycho, with the movie's single nastiest line of dialogue (do you remember what it was?).

The Moral of the Story: The world sucks and nobody cares. And Brad Pitt needs to learn more about subtlety. His attempts to bull viewers into paying more attention to him rather than Freeman are feeble and if this movie caused any of his ""Sexiest Man Alive"" admirers to sleep with one eye open... Good. But, I doubt what the killer said rang very true. About what he does being studied and followed for years. Instead, it was just hollowed out for brainless copycats like Saw (2003). If people were smart enough to appreciate the killer and his work in the context of his mission... why does Saw currently have a 7.7 rating on IMDb? Sounds like he had just a little too much faith in the human race.",7
29 October 2019,Seven.,"Se7en is a very gritty film that leaves you feeling filthy after watching it. The cinematography was gorgeously dark. On rewatching Seven, it has become one of my favourite thrillers.

19 August 2002,"Great Movie, Lousy Sound","This is an excellent, if sometimes disgusting, movie. It is intense, scary, and thought provoking. I even imagine that the dialogue is excellent. I say ""imagine"" because only about one in every three lines spoken in this movie are audible. When I went to see this movie in the theatre, I was on the edge of my seat, not just out of tension, because I was straining to hear what everyone was saying. I know they didn't have the volume turned down to low, because the soundtrack, and all other sounds in the movie were LOUD, its just all the actors sounded like they were mumbling. OK, maybe it was just the accoustics of the theatre. I rented it once on VHS, and there was the same problem -- you could barely hear anything that anyone said. OK, I had a lousy VCR, I thought it would be different when I got in on DVD. I watched it last weekend, and it was still the exact same problem. The sound editting on this movie is horrible, which is REALLY frustrating, because its an amazing movie. You'd think that someone else would have mentioned this to the producers by now, and they would have re-editted it for the DVD.

Still, if you have strong ears, and a strong stomach, this movie is well worth watching.",10
22 April 2000,A MOODY IF NOT POWERFUL THRILLER,"Se7en is a very disturbing but entertaining film. David Fincher (The Game, Fight Club) moves things along slowly and powerfully in this tale of a young and cocky detective played excellently by Brad Pitt (Kalifornia, Fight Club) who is teamed with an old veteran who is about to retire played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption, Unforgiven) and the serial killer who's identity I will not reveal is played with shocking brilliance by an actor I will not name. Overall a very dark but interesting thriller. 8.5 out of 10

10 February 2015,Best Lighting,"The DP did an amazing job using practicals and plain light from his surroundings in this movie. Love it. The energy and the way people get taken out in this movie is amazing, what can I say, I love a good mystery. This movie has definitely impacted the way I see writing and they way I use lighting to create my own projects. The actors created a great environment and enough excitement of the viewers to sit tight through the entire movie. I would love to see a sequel of this Se7en bringing out a new maniac that does things a little different but still gives the detectives and the audience the same challenges as this movie did.

3 June 2014,a few words about this masterpiece,"The theme about the seven deadly sins always is interesting for me. So, I judge it very strictly. Andrew Kevin Walker wrote an unbelievable plot. The director made the movie as good as the story. Watching the play of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey just makes the movie absolute masterpiece. Very strong, dynamic, brutal, bloody and mysterious thriller. Perhaps one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. A true classic and a masterpiece of the genre at all times, which was perhaps the best work of David Fincher. The film, which is worthy to watch it over and over again. In my opinion the theme of the seven deadly sins is complete opened. Score 10/10

10 February 2003,Se7en rates ten !,"( Hesitated before committing the 777th comment! Shall make it snappy!) Se7en was shockingly overlooked by the Academy Awards ( but for a Best Editing nomination ). Still it had some of the best assets a film can hope for: devilishly clever and faultless writing by Andrew Kevin Walker, magnificent photography by Darius Khondji which , with the superb settings, created the haunting atmosphere of the film, very good musical score (including an excerpt from a Bach piece aptly included ), and taut and gripping magnificent direction by David Fincher. So the film garnered many other rewards and met with considerable public success. The casting, though uneven, contributed thereto: Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow ( wonderful in ""Shakespeare in Love "" but otherwise overrated in most films ) are acceptable but have no real alchemy together ; Morgan Freeman is truly excellent, and Kevin Spacey simply superb ( his performance is said to have weighted considerably on his Oscar awarding for ""USUAL SUSPECTS ""); solid support in small parts is given by seasoned performers : R. Lee Ermey ( police captain ), Richard Roundtree ( D.A. ), Michael Massey ( man in massage parlour booth ), and Richard Schiff ( John Doe's lawyer ); while John C. McGinley' s acting talents are just wasted; as to Charles Dutton, I just did not see him. A discovery ( at least for me ) : Leland Orser as the nerve-wrecked customer of the dead hooker, remarkably convincing in a most difficult if short part, and who now has consistent roles in good movies.",10

22 April 2011,This is 1 of those movies can be watched only once a life time,"Another masterpiece, Se7en delivers complete realistic drama along with psychological breakdowns. One of the main beauty of this film is, as the movie tends to become much more serious and tragic, it pulls you into the mood of the movie itself, rarely a great motion picture can do that but Se7en was able to. For those who think Brad Pitt is just some commercial pretty boy (I thought so myself) this movie indeed proved me ever so completely wrong, this is one his finest movies, Brad Pitt is defiantly one of the best actors lurking around Hollywood, along side with veteran and lovable actor Morgan Freeman who also delivered outstanding performance like he always does in his movies, all and all, Se7en is a great marvelous film, the reason I say it can be watched once in a lifetime is because the ending breaks you down psychologically and it's a one time experience, watching it again and again will give you pleasure of a great movie but not the ending feel.

14 January 2015,Excellent,"One of the fist proper thriller films i ever saw at the cinema, was actually a first date film, absolutely loved it,the film not the date so much ha! The film itself led me on to become a fan of the Saw films, and any other films with the kind of twisted sordid story lines in which Se7en started, it really did start a massive trend in that kind of genre. Excellent cast and was hooked from the minute i started watching it. The story gets me every time, which allows me to re watch again and again, thats rare with a film. Was surprised they never did a sequel, shame as there was so much this story could grow in to. With that said, some films are best left as a one of, and maybe thats what makes Se7en so addictive and special.

24 January 2021,Great moments interspersed with boringness,"Se7en has some of the craziest kills in all of film and the genius of John Doe is astounding at times. Some say that the boring scenes of the characters doing nothing enhances the listed scenes, but I just find them a waste of time.

The ending is the one thing keeping this movie from a 7. That along with Kevin Spacey's psychopathic acting creates a final 15 minutes that are heart pounding.

Overall, watch this movie because of the ending.

16 March 2002,Wow.,"Seven is a good movie. Extremly disturbing, but at the same time thought provoking. The entire all star cast is just incredible in it, Morgan Freeman amazing as always, Brad Pitt is also very good in it, Gwenyth Paltrow is also her usual amazing in it. And the story is just so... so... you have to see it.

When I sat down to watch this movie I didn't expect too much from it, just another serial killer movie, which in this case happens to be about a killer who kills according to the seven deadly sins. But I was way wrong. This movie combines great food for thought with some of the most disturbing parts of movie history I've ever seen. One certian part in it, which those who've seen it know what I'm talking about, made me jump more than I ever had during a movie before. Wrapping it up, Se7en is damn good, a wow story, incredible performances and everything. If you haven't seen it, and aren't at all squeimish, go see it right now.

14 December 2014,Spoiler alert,"The movie Sev7n is about a detective name Somerset played by Morgan Freeman who is about to retire so he is sowing a new detective Mills played by Brad Pitt the way things are done at their prescient. As the movie starts Somerset is at the scene of a murder and Mills walks in and introduces himself. The murder scene turns out to be the first of many by a man trying to prove a point of some sort about the seven deadly sins.

Somerset who is about to retire is partnered with Mills. As the two start to investigate the first murder of a man who was forced to eat until it killed him a new murder case happens. At the scene of the second murder there is the word greed written in blood. Detective Mills wife Tracy played by Gwyneth Paltrow invites detective Somerset over to dinner in hopes of the two having a chance at getting to know one another. Somerset and Mills use the time after dinner to put their minds together to try and solve these cases.

From the photographs they get an idea and go to the safe house that he second victims wife is at. They show her pictures from the crime scene and ask her if she sees anything. She notices that a picture in her husband's office is upside down. The detectives go to the office and find fingerprints that were missed during the initial walk through. They send the finger prints off to be examined. After they receive the name of the who the finger prints belong to they set off to the address. When they get there they find the body of victim number three. Here the words sloth are found.

The detectives are then given a list that shows any time the seven deadly sins was looked up at the library. This list leads them to a John Doe played by Kevin Spacey. They go to Doe's apartment where things escalate and detective Mills gets hurt. The detectives are going through Does' apartment and come across a picture of a young woman. The woman turns out to be the next victim. She is found with the words lust written on the door and a man was in the room with her. The detectives are growing more eager to catch this killer.

The next day there is another victim. This one is a model whose nose was cut off. She was found with the words pride. The detectives get back to the prescient and as they are walking up the stairs a man is yelling to them. This man says that he is the one they are looking for. He is immediately taken into custody. Doe says he will take Somerset and Mills to the other bodies and give a full statement of the details of his crimes. The detectives agree to it. The three of them travel for a while to the middle of nowhere. When they get there a van comes down the road and Somerset stops it. The man in the van was asked to deliver a package. Somerset opens the package and yells to Mills to put his gun down. Somerset didn't want Mills to shoot Doe. In the end the last two deadly sins are revealed.",
6 October 2001,This really is very good,"I never specifically asked for this film. In fact, it was bought for me, with money left over from buying 'The Shining'. But am I ever glad it was bought for me.

This is really great stuff. A dark rain-soaked city gave it style, superb performances by Morgan Freeman as a burned out veteran, and by Brad Pitt as hot-shot David Mills gave it creditable performances. John Doe was suitably chilling, and the plot unfolded brilliantly.

A few people say that the gore should have been cut back, but this is something I disagree with. Not because I'm a gore-hound, but the scenes of almost untamed brutality injected the horror of the whole situation into the stylish surroundings. The sloth victim in particular. A whole year....

There are some minor gripes however. I felt that the majority of time was spent on the first three victims, then the rest of them were slightly rushed through. At the end car ride, I was still guessing how exactly it was going to end. When the box made an appearance though, I knew straight away what was in it, although I didn't know how Mills would react until he did.

Lastly, and this is nothing to do with the actual film itself, but I am positively baffled by people who say that it frightened them, and that it was scary. This film was very atmospheric, and at times, it was somewhat edgy. But scary? Don't make me laugh.

Anyway, a superb modern horror.

9.5/10 - Highly recommended.",9

27 July 2008,Sinfully slow,"Intentionally gloomy and unintentionally drab, Seven can be a difficult movie to watch for many reasons. The murders are shown and described in their most gory form. However, for a crime thriller, the movie moves at a surprisingly slow pace and the plot (beyond the brilliant idea of using seven sins) is almost too basic. Understandably, this movie was also to serve as a tirade against society and a critique of crime-ridden cities. But what the film loses in thrill value in achieving this is hardly justifiable, especially when the whole premise of this movie screams a feverishly fast and an intricate battle of wits. The film owes a lot of the accolades it receives to the 'brilliant' twist in the end. However, this film came at a time when the idea of a twist was a fairly novel concept. So, if you have sat though most of Chris Nolan's and Shyamalan's work before seeing this, you could out-think twist in this movie , and perhaps even expect it. That though is not the film's fault. It is watchable for its intriguing premise, good performances and subtle commentary. However, don't be surprised if it fails to fulfil your appetite for a real crime thriller.

9 September 2005,"After 10 years, the story still seems fresh. Best thriller ever.","Se7en is an amazing thriller that still seems fresh even after ten years. The story revolves around two cops played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, one of whom is ready to retire and the other is just starting. Freeman and Pitt work great together and I was pleased to see Brad in a movie where he isn't some charming bad boy like in most of his movies. It's a nice change and I'd like to see him do more characters like that. Freeman of course does a spectacular job as well, but that goes without saying. Although the new cop/old cop pairing has been done jillions of times before, somehow Freeman and Pitt manage to make their characters different and captivating. The two, after a rough start, become friends and a good subplot involving Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife, emerges that is a nice respite from the grittier main story, which of course later ties in with the main plot later, as in every respectable movie.

Of course, the real focus of the movie is not about our protagonists. A serial killer (Kevin Spacey) has started a killing spree and chooses his victims based on the Seven Deadly Sins, which are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, and Wrath. He chooses very creative fates in which he fights fire with fire so to speak as he turns their Sins against them. This is where the movie gets very graphic. The ""Sinner's"" fates are both cruel and unusual. If you're sqeamish, stay away, but it really isn't too bad compared to other movies. You never actually see the murders take place, just the corpses and aftermath. (Which is bad enough) This provides a nice balance that helps you focus on the detectives and their search for the elusive culprit behind all this as opposed to the story just being an excuse to show you grisly murders like the Saw series. Most of the movie revolves around the cops finding the various victims and trying to make sense of the antagonist's tantalizing hints and clues. The villain is very mysterious, and is definitely an interesting head case. He remains an enigma right up to the end, but luckily you do get to see how his mind works near the end. Spacey does a spectacular job portraying this mysterious figure when he's on screen, but sadly he's only really in it during the final part of the movie. But this isn't really a complaint. It's an interesting step out of the norm to not fill the screen time with the villain calling the heroes every five minutes to let him know that he hates them and they'll never prevail against his evil plan. The entire movie has a very dark and gloomy feel to it. Just about every inside scene is dark and outside it's usually always raining or cloudy.

Se7en is a great thriller that should appeal to everyone except for those who think that all movies should be fairy tales and should end perfectly. The plot runs along at a good pace and has one of the greatest (not happiest) surprise endings I've ever seen. I never saw it coming even as it was happening. Perhaps what I like the most about Se7en is that it is not just a gore fest. It has a feel of intelligence and even makes statements about the evils in our society and our tolerance of them. Pretty daring for a thriller. With it's dark mood, creative characters, and spectacular plot, Se7en comes highly recommended. A 10 out of 10.",10

28 November 2015,Interesting Mysterious Movie,"It's an interesting mysterious movie that makes you freeze on the screen. One of the best parts is the final part of the film which you come to conclusion that who the seventh victim is going to be. The murderer of the movie is characterized very well. He shows that he has a special ideal society in his mind and is trying to help to make the world better... The world is a good place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part. Nice dialogue. And also: ""I've been trying to figure something in my head, and maybe you can help me out, yeah? When a person is insane, as you clearly are, do you know that you're insane?"" it was some funny interesting dialogue! ... Anyway it was a nice movie to watch.

8 June 1999,Incredible and Disturbing,"David Fincher is one of my favorite directors and this film was simply brilliant. Some may think it disgusting and it was. It was far more disturbing than ""Silence of the Lambs"" which barely made me flinch. Along with ""The Game"" this is one of the truly great ""Mind-F***s"" of film history. Freeman and Pitt are excellent, but what really made this film for me was Kevin Spacey who showed that he was just warming up in ""The Usual Suspects."" His statement and the mere possibility that what he did could be looked at as just action is one of the most incredible and frightening thoughts. This film will always make me think. This is truly a brilliant film and if you can stomach it, you will be amazed

13 June 2000,"A truly brilliant film, in its own dark and twisted way.","This is a film that stays with you long after the credits have finished. It is incredibly dark and twisted. It provides an intriguing passage into the human mind and human behavior. Fincher's direction is good. He chooses dark, wet, and dim locations to spin this grotesque tale of death. The story is good in that it tells it like it is, this is no fairy tale. The performances are, for the most part, pretty good. The best performance is given by Kevin Spacey. Morgan Freeman is terrific as always. Brad Pitt is good but he could be better. This film has the greatest climax I have seen form any motion picture, it is incredibly intense.

2 August 2000,One of the best films of all time!,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10
4 February 2001,A classic Chiller,"I remember when me and my friend were going to see Showgirls one day, and at the last minute we decided to see this movie instead. All I can say is we definately made the right choice, this movie is nothing short of stunning. David Fincher and Brad and Morgan have weaved a tapestry out of suspense and surprise. This movie was David Fincher's Pennance for Alien 3, this movie had everything that one did not, it had a brilliant script, and a numbing ending. For those of you who haven't seen this movie yet, be prepared to be knocked off your seat by the ending. Be prepared to see evil in the killer John Doe, be prepared to look into Morgan Freemans haunted eyes for 2 hours, most of all be prepared to be dazzled. This is the best serial killer movie besides Silence of the Lambs. This one like Lambs will be remembered as a classic.

29 July 2002,Stunning,"One of those films that cause you to leave the cinema in a daze. A film about many things: fate, retribution, sin, religion, evil, society.

A tale about a serial killer who murders people for their sins, and a mismatched buddy cop duo who must stop him before they too become part of his 'game'. When you break it down to its basics you realise that this could have been a disaster - Joel Schumacher directs Seagal and Van Damme in a shoot 'em up action movie where our heroes save the girl in the nick of time...

The fact that the story works so well is testament to Fincher's marvellous vision and the performances of Spacey, Freeman & Pitt. The depth and originality that are added draw us into the picture and make us care about the characters. Think for moment: in a movie about a serial killer, how many people do we actually witness being slain? This isn't Jason or Freddie. What makes this scary is that John Doe is presented as a real person - a guy from the big, dirty, rainy city who just might live in the apartment below you. The fact that he is not just a random psycho who kills due to irresistable urges or the cycle of the moon makes him so much more frightening.

For sheer edge-of-the-seat cinema, the final twenty minutes are as good as any you will see. All of the pieces of the jigsaw come together and - unfortunately - they fit perfectly...",
9 January 2004,Better After Each Viewing,"I first watched Se7en in 1995. I didn't much care for it at the time, but I was 9 at the time and I couldn't understand many of the more deeper meanings of the film. Ever since then I have understood the film better after each time I watch it (5 times now), and it is now one of my favorite movies. Besides being a very entertaining film, it made me really think and I like that in a film. It provoked me to think on many things such as my views on society. Many people will not understand this film the first time around, I know that I didn't, but thats the beauty of this film, in its complexity. It deserves the praise that it received, and I don't see that often. I would hope that everyone could get a chance to see this movie, for it is wonderful.

I give Se7en 9/10. Not perfect, but as close to it as a film can get.

27 July 2005,Wow. What a brilliantly crafted movie,"i haven't a bad word to say on this movie except the fact that it may have been a wee bit slow for my liking but that doesn't falter the acting skills, the horror and the sheer genius script in this movie. kevin spacey was totally terrifying and brad pitt was in his best role and i don't rate him very highly as an actor. watch troy, you'll know what I'm talking about. morgan freeman delivers yet another masterpiece and seven is simply the greatest serial killer movie of all time. forget scream and the shining. seven is simply a one and only movie. as a matter of fact i think I'm gonna watch it now. i rated it nine purely because i believe that every movie has faults even if they are hard to see and there is no such thing as a perfect movie. but this is easily my 3rd favourite movie of all time after Back to the Future and Jurassic Park.

17 May 2006,Good but too many F.....words,"Really good thriller with lots of tension.The ending is shocking,not the sort of ending your hoping for,but one that is mind blowing,and makes you think.The acting is excellent,especially from Kevin Spacey in an earlier role,which proves he was destined to become a star.Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow are always good to watch and Brad Pitt is much better suited in these type of roles,his acting is very convincing as the young married cop.The only problem i have with this film is the amount of time the F...word is used,it seems a bit unnecessary,i know in reality you hear it all the time,but you can get sick of watching films where its used more than any other word,after all you watch films to escape the real world.But instead you watch a two hour film and hear more swearing in a couple of hours than what i hear all day in work.Other than this its an excellent film.

9 December 2022,Incredibly suspenseful and bone chilling crime thriller is a masterpiece,"David fincher's Seven, is a poignant and deeply disturbing classic of the crime thriller genre. The film is rich with talented preformances, a smart, memorable script, a haunting score, wickedly grisly set pieces, and one of the most menacing villains ever put to screen (courtesy of the great Kevin Spacey).

The film explores the most heinous of what human beings are capable of, and it does so with stunning proficiency. The film's setting is undoubtedly one of it's strongest attributes. The film does a great job establishing the city in which it takes place as the most awful cesspit imaginable. The apartments and homes are all run down and dirty, the streets are filled with cramped alleyways, and disgusting crimes seem to occur like clockwork. When it comes to the ghoulish, seven deadly sin inspired murders of the film's infamous serial killer, they are all perfectly conveyed through spine chillingly realistic set pieces that are sure to burn themselves into the audience's psyche once the film is over.

Another huge strength of the film is it's acting preformances. A large portion of the most dramatic scenes in the film are mainly carried by stellar acting alone. The acting for every single character is phenomenal, and even characters who just show up for one scene, all do an exceptional job. In particular, the preformances of the main detectives Somerset and Mills (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt), as well as the unforgettably threatening serial killer villain John Doe are particularly remarkable.

These acting preformances are complemented by an outstandingly effective script which expertly emphasizes the humanity of each of the characters (even the serial killer) while also doing a great job at keeping the story fresh and unpredictable.

However, the biggest strength of the film, by far, is it's masterfully crafted villain. The serial killer John Doe is without a doubt one of the most compelling, disturbing, and unforgettable movie villains of all time. He is the polar thematic opposite of the two detectives, and watching how his horrific plan unfolds over the course of the movie is incredibly engrossing.

Overall, there is never a dull moment in Seven. David Fincher's nail-biting, ghastly masterpiece manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for it's entire runtime and it is a movie that you surely won't forget in a hurry.",10
17 October 2021,Brutal,"I watched this movie when I was around 11 years old, which was not a good idea, I should not have done that. This movie scarred me mentally. I'm now mid 30's and I'm afraid to watch it again, that's why I purposely didn't add a score to this 'review'. To this day there are at least 3 scenes in this movie that I still remember vividly.

Directed by Fincher with an IMDB score as of writing of 8.6, there's no doubt that this is a well made film. I just wouldn't recommend it if you're sensitive or can't handle a punch in the gut.

8 January 2010,Outstanding crime/thriller/drama.,"We have here, an excellent crime movie, one of the very best of the genre.

The story is very very good, has a little tense and mystery, I really loved that, makes your spine shiver. It's an intelligent title, not very fast, but not to slow either, the dialogs are great, we had even a few good jokes, and the ending... well, seems like Kevin Spacey is the ending man, cause there are 4 films which quickly comes to mind in which we was the key piece of brilliant endings: ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Seven"", ""K-pax"", ""The Life of David Gale"".

He shows us one more time, that along with Tom Hanks and Danzel Washington, truly is one of the best actors of the 90's. I like him so much because, most often, he talks rarely, but still manages to transmit a huge amount of information through para-verbal ways of expressing message : face, eyes, mimic, gestures, head position. etc, just like in ""Seven"". His interpretation was absolutely marvelous, he suggested to me that specific madness, a serial killer has. The duo Pitt-Freeman was good to, not as good as Spacey' performance as the antagonist, but close enough. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, she always had consistent, key roles with great influence on the plot: ""The talented Mr Ripley"", ""A perfect Murder"", ""Shakeaspeare in Love"", not the case here, and you will see why (those of you who didn't see it yet).

I didn't really like the ending, as a human being, it was sick, crazy, horrible. However judging from a distant angle, besides the repulsion , I think it was spectacular, I really appreciated it, because it launched one big message: that a human being can hold on being lucid, only when balanced, when he knows that the persons he loves most are safe. If not, he is driven by emotion and impulse.

This title doesn't focus on the police investigation as on the killer psychology, that is what makes it so special. No shootings, just a twisted sick puzzle, with an extraordinary depressing ending.

As an end, I liked this thriller-drama, because it was a realistic, psychological, crime experience, which showed all of us the human condition, the unimaginable, disgusting thinks a man can do. I rate this a well deserved 9/10.",9

23 June 1999,Good but disturbing movie,"Just like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en hit a nerve with me. Of course they were both good movies, it's just films like these are disturbing because it can happen for real.

The best thing about this movie, besides Morgan Freeman, was Kevin Spacey. Whoever came up with the idea of not letting the public know he was in the movie until you actually saw his face on screen was a brilliant ploy.

Gwyneth Paltrow,gave this dark movie the only light. I think she is a wonderful actress and even though her role was small - her performance was strong.

18 May 2000,Vividly Remains In My Memory,"I saw Se7en at the theater and was glued to the screen the entire time. Maybe it was the dark and dreary atmosphere combined with great classical and jazz music. Maybe it was the performances, namely those given by Freeman and Spacey. Or perhaps it was just the gruesome subject matter and satisfying ending. Whatever it was, this film takes hold and doesn't let go, not even after you've left theater.

30 May 2020,Se7en,"Because I like horror movie very much. I saw this movie at that time, which can be said to be quite shocking. The plot is very compact, and the atmosphere of terror is also very good. Finally, killing the man's wife and forcing the man to shoot himself is the high tide of the whole play. It gives me the feeling that the power of religion is sometimes very evil, which gives the bad guys an excuse to do bad things.

16 September 2019,Not good... actually reeeeally bad...,"I watched this movie with my friend because neither of us had watched it before and when it started it was interesting and I would say it was like that until the very end. Ending scene should be most powerfulf and literally mind breaking scene but noooo... Ending scene in this movie is so predictable and not fully explained... I would like to take back 2 hours of my time... There is so many good crime movies that are not popular as this one but that is not right. Except hot Bread Pitt, at the end there is nothing else I enjoyed. I do not want to spoil anything because there is nothing to spoil anyway but my sincere suggestion is to skip this movie because it is so overrated.

PS: I gave this movie 3 stars because Bret Pitt is just so hooooot.... :)

19 February 2014,In my top of all times,"Can you picture great cast, great acting, great directing, great villain, great ending, great cinematic, matching score, great scrip????... you can obviously guess this will be a great film.

Pitt, Freeman, Paltrow, Spacey they all give some of the most thrilling, chilling, and amazing performances of their careers.

Definitely recommend this fill to anyone who is looking to see what good old fashion movie making is all about.

I think the only movie that compares to this level of film making is Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal and Clarice will definitely for ever have a place in our hearts, but we will also never forget Detectives Mills and Somerset, lovely Tracy and nightmarish John Doe.

27 January 2006,The best serial killer movie I have seen,"Se7en really raises the bar on the cop and serial killer movies. And it is not like any other movies from it's genre. Director David Fincher captures the essence of the dark, sinful world created in the mind of screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker with every move of the camera. The atmospheric look of this movie is outstanding. Hallways always have this dark unsettling blackish tone and non-stop pouring rain occupies the outside world.

I think Brad Pitt gives his best performance up to date in this movie. His not caring acting style really fits the character of the rookie Detective Mills. But it is Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey who display the best acting in this movie. Their characters have depth like very few movie characters have. Morgan Freeman with his dynamic, brooding acting style brilliantly portrays the intelligent, cynical Detective Somerset. And the range of Kevin Spacey 's acting gives his character, the serial killer John Doe, an extra dimension of depth.

Detective Somerset knows the rules of his profession. And he tries to warn the rookie Detective Mills from the dangers involved in it. But Mills is too busy proving himself on his new position as a detective, he doesn't really care for the advice. And as the numbers of the murder victims grow Detective Somerset, who wanted to retire, changes his mind and stays with the case to warn and help Mills. Somerset tries his best to educate Mills on the subject of serial killers, he gives him books to read on the case and tries to give him moral advice too. But in the end John Doe, the serial killer, is the one who educates them both on the subject of morality  screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker gives this movie one of the most tragic endings I have ever seen on movie.

Must see movie",9
26 February 2000,The most suspensefull thriller ever,"Watching Seven is intense. You watch the movie on the edge of your seat all of the time. It's amazing how this movie gets your attention from the first minute. The plot of this movie is excellent. A serialkiller who kills according to the seven sins. Newcomer Mills(Brad Pitt) and Agent Somerset(Morgan Freeman) investigate these crimes. But these crimes are different than every other crime they (and everyone else) ever saw. They are so hideous and horrible.. A man who has been lying in his appartement for a year, strapped to his bed, only to have photo's taken of him each week or so, showing the process of decomposition. Terrifying.

Seven is probably the most suspensefull thriller i ever saw. David Fincher keeps you interested all the time. And you keep wondering what will happen next. It's not your typical detective crime story. It's actually a very, very scary movie.

I won't write too much about the actual storyline, and especially not about the ending, which is without a doubt a very awesome one. It leaves you with a feeling that you just witnessed something truly special.

A classic in it's sort. 10 out of 10.",10
25 December 2001,A Masterpiece,"One of three films I've seen in the past ten years or so which I consider a masterpiece. I don't want to ruin it by commenting any more than that. The other two films on my list, though, happen to be ""Down by Law,"" directed by Jim Jarmusch, with Tom Waits, Roberto Benigni, and John Lurie; and ""Henry Fool,"" directed by Hal Hartley. How's that for a movie review?

We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed...forever.
John Doe


Probably the best crime-thriller ever created. Se7en has aged so incredibly well, it will simply leave you in awe.

Everything in this film is perfect: the screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting and sound design; It all comes together flawlessly.

The ending has one of the most intense build ups in cinema history. No matter how often you rewatch it, your heart rate will increase each time you experience it.

Undoubtedly a masterpiece. It absolutely deserves a perfect rating! My favorite flick by David Fincher.",10
5 July 2020,What's in the box?!,"I can watch this movie over and over! I love it.

Morgan Freeman is awesome as always. Brad Pitt is kind of a goober in the movie but he grows on you.

16 October 2006,Se7en is a modern cinema classic,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10
14 December 2014,Lacks Se7en out of 10 Stars: Whats in the Box? Sucks?,"Before watching this movie I am expecting to be entertained and getting mindblown by the scenes that I am going to watch. But after watching this movie, I literally got out of my room, went to the bathroom and shouted for about 10 seconds. This movie is one of the most overrated movies that I have ever seen in my whole life. Even if I am a big fan of detective movies, this is one movie that I will never watch again for the rest of my life. The dark and suspenseful environment was supposed to be thrilling and entertaining. I was so disappointed on how the movie flowed. It just never reeled me in. I was planning to give this movie a 5, but the atrocious and worst ending in the genre of detective movies showed up. So cheers for that great ending, you just received 2 more stars down. The only upside for this movie is the amazing cast that it has. Avoid this movie at all costs!! If you had happen to watch it, just leave before it gets to the ending!

30 June 2018,"It has plot holes everywhere, but if you play along, its pretty fun (if not dark) ride","So the setting is kind of ambiguous, some east-coast American inner city where it rains everyday. This is the true odd couple detective mish-mash set-up. A typically crusty Morgan Freeman character and a typically hot-tempered Brad Pitt character. But the movie's craftiness in character reveal and its play on morality is pure Fincher from this era. Se7en is only a seven, but a must-watch.

31 March 2000,"""whats in the box""","Se7en is a film that is gruesome without ever showing violence.It is disturbing without ever being psychological.It provides one of the best endings to a film without ever giving any evidence as to the conclusion.Andrew Kevin Walker delivers a script that is completely devoid of any kind of sentiment,which is at the same time a conforming buddy movie.Morgan Freeman delivers another performance that is so subtle you often forget that its only 'acting'.He is so disaffected by the horrors he sees,a parallel with Brad Pitt,a wet-behind-the-ears rookie(though he'd be loathe to admit it)who is so repulsed by the travesties the two men encounter,that his life is destroyed by his inability to cope with it.Se7en rarely shows graphic violence,instead we are treated to the scenes that follow,the bloody messes and repulsively realistic cadavers-but it still leaves a trace of bile in your throat,and a hollow feeling in your stomach that stays with you for a few days.Andrew Kevin Walker though,is surely messed in the head,for only a mentalist could dream up such horiffic ways to go as to be force-fed spaghetti till you burst,or to be f***ed by a guy with a huge knife on his Johnson.The climax of the film is the high point,both unexpected and perfectly suited to wiping away the confident feeling of resolution that Somerset and Mills had gained,With Kevin Spacey delivering a short performance that pretty much burns a hole in the screen,his cool,restrained psychosis perfectly suited to a killer who would go to such lengths as slicing off the ends of his fingers to avoid leaving fingerprints,and Spacey delivers his lines with such icy assuredness,that his performance,though he only has about ten minutes screen time,is the part that everybody remembers.David Fincher's direction is stylistic and atmospheric,every scene is played out in darkness,except for the scenes with Gwyneth Paltrow,who is the source of light for both men,as they are increasingly drawn into the back alley worlds of darkness.",
1 October 2002,Around...I'll be around,"This is one of the most methodic films that I have ever seen. From the opening scenes before the credits to the tense climax, this film keeps it's pace and it's audience on the edge of there seats. The final line of this film always give me goosebumps, although they were ripped off in the Alex Nauman Classic ""Wash the Spider Out"". Although the actor in that film, Tanny Deliere, gives a much better performance than Morgan Freeman and Shannon Koenig is only slightly hotter than Mrs. Paltrow, this is amuch more original film.

The storyline moves very well, keeping the viewer thinking and the ending is one of the best, most well thought-out I've ever seen. A must see!

29 July 2022,A very intriguing crime thriller.,"I have two things to say about this movie- It's very compelling, and it's messed up. It definitely screams David Fincher with the pacing and cinematography. It's extremely creepy an unsettling and keeps you on the hook. I thought Morgan Freeman (Somerset) and Brad Pitt (Mills) had a perfect dynamic of experienced and inexperienced. It showed how methodical a season veteran was an how a rookie was reckless and immediate. The killings were extremely gruesome and I was especially disturbed by the lust killing. I heard there was a the plot twist before I watched this movie, (thankfully didn't know what it was) and I was trying to figure out what it was the whole time- and it was difficult to predict. I kinda saw it coming but at the same time I didn't see it coming at all- I felt my heart pounding and my eyes glued to the screen almost the entire time. The ending made sense to Mills character and how he was acting throughout the movie. I see why a lot of people like this film-

8 March 2006,excellent thriller,"this is a very high quality thriller with an excellent cast. morgan freeman is very good as are brad pitt, kevin spacey and other members of the cast. I watched this on DVD, with dolby digital ex and dts 6.1 surround sound. The quality of the sound is very good and very cinema like. The surround sound is excellent, and gives you a feel of the atmosphere and its surroundings. One hears the bells as the train goes by, the sound of traffic and the other many subtle sounds that give the film its ambiance. Its a difficult film to understand at first, and may require more than one viewing to fully grasp. There is a wonderful chemistry between morgan and brad, the likes of which i have not seen in a thriller since.

This is a very good DVD to own.

23 April 2023,Se7en (1995) Review,"Rewatched April 13th, 2023

Each time I watch this, it gets better. So chilling! I need to have Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman to reunite in another film please and thank you. This film shows one of their best performances! It's a shame that neither garnered much awards attention. And even though he is trash as a being, which fits as his character (makes you wonder about a lot of his most famous roles like this), Kevin Spacey is ruthless as John Doe. The direction by David Fincher (I truly believe this to be his best), cinematography by Darius Khondji, and screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker are all amazing. The ending is by far one of the best things I've seen. Highly recommend!

11 June 2009,One of the greatest murder mysteries ever filmed,"Director David Fincher entered the world of directing on the heels of one of the most classic American Sci-Fi franchises of all time, the Alien series. He followed James Cameron's classic ""Aliens"" with the not quite as critically acclaimed Alien 3. However, he has since shown us that he can indeed compete with the likes of Cameron and other A-list directors. He is most widely known for the immense cult classic ""Fight Club"" and Oscar monster ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", but his first stand-alone film after Alien 3 was the brilliant and classy crime thriller ""Seven."" This film proves that right from the start Fincher was a force to be reckoned with. This of course isn't to underplay the excellence of the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, or the intense and spine-tingling score by Howard Shore, or the excellent performances by all actors, including the actor who plays the killer (as the actor was kept under wraps during the marketing for this film, and isn't in the credits until the very end, i won't reveal who it is but it's one of my person favorites). This movie is a prime example of all elements of great film-making coming together to make something that is simply beautiful.

Probably the strongest element of this film is the way it unfolds. ""Seven"" is a master class in story-telling. The plot is handled with care and expertise. Fincher knows just the right times to be subtle, and make you really pay attention to catch everything, and then when to throw something directly in your face. While the film tells the story of probably one of the most sadistic and disturbing serial killers of all time, none of the killings are actually shown on screen. Instead, the film crew used other means of conveying the gruesome details, things like dialogue and pictures. It gives the characters a much better chance to drive the story forward, and it forces you to use your imagination which makes the more disturbing points all the more haunting.

While this film really is not an action movie, the small bit of action there is in the film is very exciting, and the dark, haunting nature of the film will leave a lasting impact on you for sure. This is helped along by Howard Shore's subtle yet fantastic score.

Seven is without a doubt one of the greatest murder mysteries ever filmed. It is a lesson in suspense and plot-development and a triumph for all involved in its making. Make no mistake, this is not a happy film, but it's a must-see for all true fans of good cinema.",10

2 March 2021,Three words that make this movie: The Final Act.,"""Se7en"", directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and Gwyneth Paltrow, focuses on two cops (a young up and coming detective (Pitt) and an older, more experienced one (Freeman)). This film is classic Fincher: dark, moody, thematically complex, tense, and a slow burn. From the opening shot, the yellow and green hues of the film draw you in to the mysterious and dark crime world of NYC. We follow Pitt and Freeman in this rainy setting as they slowly uncover the identity of a serial killer that uses a peculiar reason for his murders: the seven deadly sins. As the killer (Spacey) slowly begins to make his way through each sin, and punishing those sinners, both Freeman and Pitt's characters have to face their own demons. This is NOT a movie to watch if you're looking for a fun, action packed, and uplifting time. Get ready to face a film with a BLEAK outlook on life and a devastatingly disturbing finale. Be prepared to engage yourself from start to finish; it's a movie that makes you think, and every word, every shot, and every moment matters. Critiques say that the first 2 thirds of this movie are ""dull and uneventful"". This is the case, yes, but only for the unfocused and distracted mind. Being fully immersed in the first part of this film, pays off when the final act finally comes around. In the end, we have a masterpiece of a crime drama that is original, thought provoking, hauntingly beautiful, and extremely well-acted, written, and directed by some of the best in the business.",10
13 January 2019,One of the best climax,"""A nerve jangling thriller with gut wrenching climax."" no better description can be there. Perfect thriller for people who love detective and crime based movies with the likes of Morgan Freeman,Brad Pitt.High accolades to legend Kevin spacey. P.s You can watch it on netflix .

31 May 2001,Simply the Best,"It's rare when all the pieces of a movie fit together perfectly. But that is exactly what we get with ""Seven."" Everything contributes to the dark mood of the picture. It's always raining, the music is sombre, and the script always keeps you guessing and jumping at shadows. But what sets ""Seven"" apart from all the rest is its acting. Morgan Freeman can do more with a simple sigh than many actors can achieve with a paragraph of dialogue. And while I always viewed Brad Pitt as a himbo, he proves in this movie, that he can act. But many movies have great acting. Where ""Seven"" stands head and shoulders above others is in its script and direction. There are virtually no flaws in this movie. 5 stars out of 5 !

I do wonder why its IMDb rating isn't higher. This is easily a 9.5 film across the board. If only one thriller out of 100 would be this good. Wow.

I also wonder why IMDb insists on 10 lines of text for a submission. But it does prod me to add: if you like thrillers and can stomach some very, very strong scenes, don't miss this one.

Is that enough lines?

7 December 2020,Turn up that NIN soundtrack!,"Se7en, directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and written skillfully by Andrew Kevin Walker. is a well executed movie that ranks among the best 90s movies. To begin with, the cast has done their job masterfully as they make you descend along with the characters into the wild and dark atmosphere of the movie. Needless to mention the Brad Pitt's performance, which offers the viewers a superb performance that pushes the envelop of his own career. Moreover, the plot is phenomenal! At the face value, it might seem like a typical cat and mouse tale, but as you go along with its phenomenal storyline, things begin to sound odd and that's a sign of realization which tells you things are a bit a different here. Actually, this picture is of a brilliant point that pivotal events happen without any forewarning and then, leaves you alone with your thoughts. Last but not least, a unforgivable mistake is it to let go of its mind-blowing soundtracks. From the beginning to the end, it stands on top. Have I been asked about my favorite myth, this masterpiece will rank the best in my mind by moments. Simply put, a great must see for all the movie lovers and crime fans.",10

31 January 2019,Outstanding performance and direction,"David Fincher's film is absolutely amazing - it's plot is perfect and the writing is simply excellent. Morgan freeman gave multiple amazing performances in the 90's and this is no exception. Brad Pitt pulled his character off near perfectly with some small flaws at the start of the movie (just slightly cliché dialogue). But by far the best performance (though short) was Kevin Spacey as John Doe, who I would say is even comparable to Hannibal Lecter himself acting wise. He perfectly mastered the act of menace and intimidation in every one of his scenes, I was pulled in whenever he was on screen. The biggest flaw in the film is some predictable writing during the 2nd act, but that is well compensated for with the 3rd act twist. I would recommend this movie for anyone that enjoys 90's classics and has 2 hours to spare.

15 August 1999,SPOOKY and GROSS,"This was shown one Monday here so I thought I'd check it out. It had a really good cast Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow. But it got way too spooky for me (it was about midnight) So I turned it off after the bed scene (The guy that was tied to a bed for 364 days) That was so gross. I'm gonna rent it and see it at day this time. See it only if you can stand gross but really gross things. If Scream made you sick DO NOT see this film.

2 August 2001,I still jump out my skin watching this,"Se7en entered British cinemas and I'm not entirely sure we were prepared for such an intelligent and demanding movie. Spacey, Pitt and Freeman turn in some of the best performances imaginable for this type of movie and I could not believe that they were so ill-rewarded for their acting efforts. A film that stretches the brain (literate film viewers whooped with joy to see such references hauled into public awareness) whilst recognising that most might not get all the clues (cue Cliffs Notes folks), well it makes a change from cheap devil-worshipping mythologies.

Walker created a screenplay sizzling with wit and intrigue. You see almost nothing of the SEVEN that stalk the plot (though I swear a minor edit has occurred on the video version at the end regarding Tracey). And the cinematography (of which much was made in the press regarding silver prints to highlight the darkness) has to be some of the most imaginative ever providing for a thriller drama of this kind.

I still find little intriguing details to attend to whenever I watch this movie - like others in my fav raves catalogue (Memento, The Usual Suspects, Twelve Monkeys, Fight Club) it demands something from the viewer's intellect and attention that some felt might have bypassed the ""Star Wars"" generation of special effects kids. Wrong - I'm of that generation too, and trust me, there is still room for the literate thriller to pull the punters.",9

I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",8
12 April 2023,One of the best Noir Dark Thriller Movie.,"From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition.",10
9 May 2019,Simply beautiful and it fulfill all the quality of a serial killer.,"I've never expected it to be turned out like this. Its just human feeling that got mixed up in the way of living and they are quite necessary without them life would be, I don't what to say literally I don't know word to describe. So there are psycho killer out there without these human feeling who will stop at nothing until you recognize them its too late. Its extraordinary plot and some minor details were omitted here and there. I think Morgan Freeman narration would have done that trick because his voice has dark feeling.

10 April 1999,"An Amazing, Shocking film","I judge a film to be worthy of watching judging by the response that it elicits from me. A film that challenges me, draws me into it is definitely worth seeing, and Se7en definitely fits that criterion. This movie shocked an amazed me, leaving me practically breathless by the conclusion (which is one of the most shocking twists I have ever seen). It terrified and captivated me. A must see.

30 June 1999,Some scenes are worth seeing,"What can I say? I can see why this movie was recommended to me after I admitted that 'Silence of the Lambs' was one of my favorite movies. ""Seven"" features an interesting premise (an intelligent serial killer chooses his victims according to the seven deadly sins) and some pretty cool, very dark plot twists. However, in my mind there is no comparison between ""Seven"" and ""Silence,"" and most of this judgment comes from the acting ability (or lack thereof) displayed. Kevin Spacey is the only worthy actor in the bunch, and his performance is great. Though I've seen Morgan Freeman in better roles -- he doesn't do much here. Gwyneth was fine, but nothing special -- she was better in ""Shakespeare in Love."" And finally, at the risk of being attacked, I would just like to say that Brad Pitt does not have much acting ability, and it is painfully obvious here. His forced whining and yelling *almost* spoiled the last scene for me. I say *almost* because I find the entire last part of the movie (the part with Kevin Spacey, incidentally) very well-written and worth seeing. Spacey's character, ""John Doe,"" is extremely creepy and his lines are well-written and even funny at times. He is everyone's worst nightmare vision of a serial killer -- insane and dangerous, yet rational and calculating. Spacey's voice is exactly right for the part -- it gave me chills. Other than the last scene (the car, the desert), the movie is gruesome, often too dark, and badly acted. The concept is a good one, however, and it is done justice. Check out the way the ""pride"" victim is set up -- it's genius. If you're a fan of Kevin Spacey, you won't be dissatisfied by the end of the movie. He's basically why I saw it. Caution, though : Brad needs SERIOUS acting lessons. Or maybe he's had too many -- everything he does here seems forced",
9 July 1999,junk,"I basically thought this movie was exploitative junk. The violence was gratuitous and the plot was not compelling. Although I must admit that I found the movie very disturbing, that does not mean it was well made. Watching people being tortured and mutilated for no reason is disturbing even if the movie as a whole is terrible. Moreover, my views are not based on my being squeamish -- which I am not. I think Silence of the Lambs -- which is gross and disturbing, and which some people compare to Se7en -- to be one of the great movies of all time.

2 December 1999,A work of art.,"It seems to be the trend now to equate this movie to Silence of the Lambs, but to me, this movie far surpasses that one. Not to say that Silence of the Lambs wasn't good, it was actually one of the best of its kind, and Hannibal Lecter might be the best serial killer ever. However, Seven blows that movie away and if not for The Usual Suspects, it would be the best detective-thriller of the 90's.

There are so many aspects to this movie worth mentioning, I couldn't fit it into 1000 words. Yes, this movie may be considered too slow for the action junkies of the world. Sorry, Arnie and Sly Stallone do not make an appearance here. But for those who place a higher importance on acting, directing, and storyline, this is the movie for you. Fincher deserves top mention. This guy continues to amaze me with top notch films. Never saw Alien3, as I don't like horror movies and don't care about the Alien trilogy. But The Game is a very underrated thriller, you can't go wrong with Sean Penn and Michael Douglas. And as far as Fight Club goes, well, words cannot express how good that movie was, so I won't even try. But with those 2 movies alone, as well as this one, Fincher proves he is one of the best up and coming directors in the business.

We all know Brad Pitt is usually placed in movies merely for eye candy for the female audience, but obviously Fincher has a knack for bringing the best out of Pitt. He's really not a terrible actor, and he was actually pretty good in 12 Monkeys, but it is here and Fight Club where he does his best work. He's no Morgan Freeman, and he is certainly eclipsed here by Freeman, but Pitt manages to hold his own effectively. Paltrow is, well, Paltrow here, pretty boring and monotone, just like most parts she plays. But she is as important to the story as any of the others, and based on that she fits in well.

As good as everyone was in this movie, Kevin Spacey dominates the screen, as he does with every movie he has ever been in. He is far and away the best actor going today, and his role in Seven may be his best so far. Giving away any details of his part would take away from the effect of the movie, but let's just say it is chilling how good he is. Every scene is important, and the scenery and music help develop the mood of the story, which is definitely grim. Not sure why so many people have revolted at the ""gore and violence"" of this movie, as most of it is implied and never really shown. People don't seem to have a problem reading about it in the newspapers, in books, or even the Bible, but I guess it's different when it's presented in your face on the big screen. Doesn't make sense to me, but whatever. If you can look past that, you're looking at one of the top 10 movies of the 90's, and one of the best ever. 10/10, 100/100, 1000/1000, an all-time classic.",10
6 November 2000,Bleah,"Overrated and formulaic, right down the tips of its credits and the cheesy ""7"" that is in the title...do I hear hisses from the peanut gallery? I realize a lot of people adore this movie, but I don't. Se7en has the characteristic (for me, anyway) that a lot of critics are saying plagues ""Pay It Forward."" It's too manufactured. There's something very artificial and contrived about the movie, and I just can't buy into it. As for the ""surprise"" ending...sorry, but I saw it coming from a mile away.

10 March 2023,"Haunting, Disturbing, Intense, Thrilling , Masterful.","""Seven"" is a gripping psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. David Fincher's direction and Andrew Kevin Walker's writing combine to create a tense, atmospheric, and thought-provoking film that is sure to leave a lasting impression on the viewer.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give powerhouse performances as detectives tasked with solving a series of gruesome murders that are linked to the seven deadly sins. As they delve deeper into the case, they find themselves facing a twisted and diabolical killer who is always one step ahead.

The film's dark and moody visuals, coupled with the haunting score, add to the film's tension, making for an immersive and unforgettable experience. The themes of morality and the human condition are explored in a nuanced and intelligent way, adding depth to the already impressive story.

But it's the film's ending that really sets it apart. The twist is one of the most shocking and memorable in cinematic history, and it leaves the audience reeling, contemplating the deeper implications of the story long after the film has ended.

In conclusion, ""Seven"" is a must-see for fans of the psychological thriller genre. It's a film that will keep you engaged and invested in the story until the very end, and its themes and ending are sure to leave a lasting impression. Highly recommended.",10
20 February 2023,"In my opinion, this movie is a masterpiece in the history of cinema, a movie that has never been made like it. IMDB scores movies out of ten. In my opinion, it is 100/100.","This unique wonder of cinema history can only come from the direction of a genius like David Fincher. From the moment the movie starts, you will be lost in the movie. It is a very philosophical movie that shows different aspects of God and humanity. Ever since I saw this movie, I have been fascinated And it caught me (even godfather1, which I know is the best movie in history and I love it, didn't make me) the game that deserved an Oscar, in my opinion, two outstanding and legendary artists, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, who should win the best actor, and also, in my opinion, Kevin Spacey is amazing. An actor who showed another side of acting and I was really like Shrandied, really enjoyable, the best psychological killer and chain with really interesting and thought-provoking dialogues that you have never seen before. The ending that I had never seen in the history of cinema (I have to thank Brad Pitt for this), as long as the cinema stands, this film shines among the masterpieces of the history of cinema.",10
8 June 2002,"Depraved, revolting and obscene","This movie, and all the praise it engenders on this web site, make one despair for humanity in general, and for contemporary America in particular.

Technically excellent, ""Se7en"" is a soulless, cold-blooded monstrosity which exults in the worst evils the human mind can encompass and uses every manipulative device known to modern cinema to tittilate and excite a degenerate audience. Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an immature, poorly educated, foul-mouthed, impulsive and shallow caricature of a man, is the template for the rootless, heartless, mindless young males who cheer this film as ""one of the greatest of all time."" It is NOT. It is filth and corruption incarnate.

0 out of 10. Every print of this bestial nightmare should be dissolved in the most corrosive acid possible.

2 February 2002,takes you to another place,"The Thin Red Line is the best war film I have ever seen. But I hate to classify it as that, because if you do and someone reads that it's a war film, they're going to expect Saving Private Ryan. The two were compared when first released because they were released the same year and were both up for Oscars. However, the two are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FILMS WITH DIFFERENT INTENTIONS. So, I won't waste time, energy or space comparing the two.

There is a stellar, all-star cast, but there really is no star. The film has a flexible narrative and the story adapted from James Jones' novel is told from different points of view. This is a problem for today's audiences who are not open minded when watching a film that doesn't play like a standard popcorn flick or T.V. movie. Like Mulholland Drive a viewer can come in the middle of it and not really miss anything as far as not understanding what's happening now. It's like an or circular film that just keeps going - like the war for the soldiers that never seems to end.

This film has been criticized so many times, for so many different reasons. And those who criticize it, also criticize those who like it, saying that they (the people who like it) think that film is philosophical, when really it isn't. Or theat the philosophy is only sophomoric. But the film is about the soldiers and I would doubt that these soldiers were Philosophy majors, so if the philosophy is sophomoric (which I don't feel it is) it's because they are. But I should point out and remind people that Terrence Malick taught Philosophy at MIT, and I would think he has a better comprehension of it that the people who are criticizing his use of it.

I also think that the people who criticize this film are the same hypocrites who hated 2001: A Space Odyssey, until it became a classic, and then started to like it. The Thin Red Line is a film that is ahead of an audience. Like the work of Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch, the film takes more than one viewing to fully understand, which may be impossible. But if you're open minded enough, it is such an enjoyable movie in its grandeur. That is another thing people dislike, its pretensions. But how do they expect Malick to deal with a subject as broad as WAR, and not just a group of soldiers, and avoid the possibility of pretension?

Most war film deal with a select few that we as an audience get to know. We don't here. We only get to glance. And we glance at so many people it's hard to KNOW any of them. I have not fought in war, but I would assume that is what it is like. You'd get to know who you're close to, but the others, you would just see.

I think that this film is more realistic about war than most. We don't just see a constant attack. We see the quieter moments. Not all war is fighting, sometimes the hardest times are when nothing happens in life. People always say to ""keep busy"". Well what happens if you don't?

We see the women in these soldiers' life (another thing criticized). I don't know about you, but if I was alone in a war, I'd probably be thinking about the good things in life too - which unfortunately may also turn out to be bad.

The acting in the film is superb. Nick Notle, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson, Jim Caviezel are all fantastic. The music is awe inspiring. When the main theme hits a certain point, a few minutes in it's breathtaking. The cinematography - the island - is like a character in itself. Man's war is at the same time a war against nature, against our environment. I can't remember any other film that took such an effective turn in using the camera to make the viewer seem like you are in the film.

I can still remember some of the images. They're imprinted like a photograph burned onto paper.

Whether people admit it or not, this film is a masterpiece. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. And I am glad that I had an open enough mind so that I could see that film for what it is - a work of true art.",
7 March 2002,'A Great & Unique Movie ',"Recently, I started ( as a new IMDB user ) to comment on old movies that I saw years ago , .. & the reason is that I liked them very much & I'd like 2 waste my time commenting on them despite the fact that no one might read my comments , ..

8 January 2003,I liked it somehow,"Let me just say, this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It was pretty gory, you know, the deaths and all. Call me a pansy, but I watched it at night and every time I walked down the hallway I expected Kevin Spacey to jump out and slaughter me in a creative way. Then, I kept contemplating how the ending could have differed. In the end, I did like this movie. But I find it strange for an 18 year old girl to enjoy this type of movie as much as I did (I'm talking about myself). If you are in the mood to be awake all night in fear, I would recommend this film.

17 December 2018,Simply Outstanding!,"This is the perfect thriller film which works on many levels. The whole script and storyline were very well done, and the casting was impeccable, except perhaps for Brad Pitt, who is highly overrated in my opinion. Freeman plays his part exceptionally well, as always. The villain is a very clever, witty psychopath, who thinks more than 10 steps ahead of anyone. Kevin Spacey, who I know is currently a shamed actor, performed outstandingly well in this film, with his sublte, slow, deliberate movements and menacing smiles. The whole movie being about him and his wrong-doings, works perfectly with him as the main character, a strong, intense actor of pure talent.

22 August 2019,Expecting another one like that,"We are in 2019 and I am waiting for a one like this for sooooo long!

I won't review it but suggest similar films and ask you if you got any suggestions to add to the (poor) list:

1. The Silence of the Lambs 2. Shutter Island ? 3. ? Usual Suspects... not very... 4.?? 5. Prisoners (50/50) 6. Spoorloos (kind of...)

Maybe Hitchcock movies are such intense but the cinematography is old school.

Se7en merits a 10/10.

17 August 1999,"Harrowing, gripping, utterly downbeat film.","I've seen Se7en twice, the second time because it was on when I was flipping channels. This film is absolutely brilliant, and it's difficult to think of a single misstep.

But it's not a film to enjoy; I think there's only one even vaguely upbeat scene in the film, there mostly to provide the necessary contrast with the awesome finale. The rest of the time it portrays the police inhabiting a city where it continually rains, where anyone could be indescribably evil, and where it takes the exceptionally twisted acts of the serial killer to shock the police.

Plaudits should go to everyone involved, with praise being heaped on Freeman, Pitt and Spacey. But the loudest applause should be reserved for the writer and director, Andrew Kevin Walker and David Fincher, for turning out such a masterpiece. Even the producers deserve some credit, for having the faith not to slap on a smiley happy ending, as is de rigeur in too many of the current confections being churned out of Hollywood.

See this film. You may well not enjoy it, you might not sleep too soundly afterwards, but it's worth it, to see one of the greatest films of recent years.",9
30 April 1999,"A brilliant but depressing, profoundly evil film","It is not often that I am offended by a ""mainstream"" film. This is, without a doubt, one of the most distressing, disturbing and graphically horrific films I have ever seen. It approaches the level of shock and outrage I felt after seeing documentary footage of the appalling brutality and inhumanity of the various WW II concentration camps. It is a very dark(quite literally) vision of an Urban Hell from which no one can seemingly escape-including the viewer. I would strongly urge you to wait for a warm sunny day before seeing this one-you'll need it.

6 August 1998,A vicious killer is stalked by two cops who will do anything to catch their man.,"This movie will leave you breathless. A completely grotesque movie that keeps you in suspense from beginning to end. A crazed serial killer will do anything to kill his victims according to the seven deadly sins. This movie is creative and follows the planned murders of seven victims who ""deserved"" to die. Mills and Sommerset pull out all the stops in the classic horror freak movie. It is cleverly done and the script is written in a way that the actors seem to stay one step ahead of the director. Mills and Sommerset follow along awaiting the final confrontation and David Fincher keeps the viewer waiting to see how the killer completes his tasks. The movie will remain with you for ever as it will change your insight on life's little sins.

13 April 2000,Darkly thrilling,"This is without doubt one of the most stylish, yet simply frightening films to be made in a long time. Major credit for this film must be given to David Fincher, this film owes its success as much to his style and direction as it does anything else. This film has it all: a very good cast, great style, a good plot with some great twists, and a good dose of gore for flavour. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well cast as the leads, Freeman delivering yet another polished performance as the battle hardened mentor, and Pitt showing promise as the brash young detective. Undoubtedly a highlight for me was the chilling performance of Kevin Spacey, showing his immense talent in a brilliant cameo as John Doe, a villain on par with Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter. A certain Ms Paltrow gives a solid performance as Pitt's beautiful young wife, but Spacey set the tone. The dark tones of most scenes are perfect in setting the mood of the film, and are used well by Fincher. A very good plot and screenplay, coupled with an original idea, combine with the cast and style to create a most unforgettable movie, and one of the most intense cinematic experiences in recent memory. 8 out of 10.",8

If what I've said doesn't make you just want to get up and go rent Se7en then watch it for yourself. you've got nothing else to do anyways your just surfing the net.

But I bet you anything, that you will be back at IMDB writing terrific remarks about Se7en just as soon as you see it.

18 February 2005,How Deliciously Evil,"The film ""Se7en"", directed by David Fincher (Fight Club), is a stylish thriller that pulls out all the stops to catch the audiences attention. The wily veteran detective, William Somerset, is played excellently by Morgan Freeman. He brings up the younger detective, David Mills, surprisingly well played by Brad Pitt, who is not known for his role in dramatic films. Later on, Pitt will work with Fincher in Fight Club,but that is a different story. The two detectives are chasing a serial killer who is committing murders according to the seven deadly sins(Gluttony, Wrath, Envy, Pride, Lust, Greed, and Sloth). The deaths and murders in this film are not too extreme, but they get the point across. The plot and storyline is well planned and thought out. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife. This is Paltrow in a smaller role and she plays it well. But lets not forget how the title of my summary comes about. The killer,named appropriately John Doe, is played maniacally by Kevin Spacey, a sick and twisted Kevin Spacey who's in fine form after The Usual Suspects and before American Beauty, both of which he won Academy Awards for. Fincher shoots this movie flawlessly; the camera-work is excellent, cinematography is good. And the ending is one that is a predecessor for films such as Saw and The Bone Collector. 9/10",9
27 May 2002,Unique detective thriller,"This is a good film, though clearly below ""The Usual Suspects"" when rating films of the '90's. What makes the film stand out is its complete uniqueness. No other film comes to mind to even compare it to.

The achievement of the film is that even though it is unique, there is an undercurrent of believability about the whole thing. We know that mass murderers are a disturbing reality in modern-day life. We also know that it is not unusual for such murderers to plant clues, either consciously or subconsciously, i.e., to make it into a game played between himself and the cops.

This is what happens here, as the murders are carefully orchestrated to illustrate each one of the seven deadly sins. This is not so far out as it sounds, when you consider that we live in an era in which religious fanatics routinely blow themselves up for their cause, and routinely butcher countless thousands of their countrymen who oppose their cause in many places around the globe.

The explanation the Kevin Spacey character gives near the end of the film is entirely believable, and his performance, brief as it is, stands out. What is less believable are the performances of Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as the detectives. The cliche of the cop about to retire paired with the energetic young cop has been beaten to death, and I am sorry it was used here. This would have been a better film if it had featured two detectives working together without the baggage thrown in (Freeman with his ""I'm out of here"" cynicism, and Pitt with his ""new in town"" naivete). The interaction of the two detectives just did not seem genuine to me. Freeman was better in other films, like ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Unforgiven"". And Pitt is just not one of my favorite actors.

Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the relatively few countries of the world in which the ""marketplace of ideas"" concept has taken root and flourishes are accustomed to expressing our ideas verbally. For the rest of the world, however, there is a depressingly frequent resort to violent action as a way of expressing ideas. In a world in which it is almost routine for Palestinians to sneak into Israel and blow themselves up in support of their cause, it does not seem incredible that the Kevin Spacey character here would sacrifice himself to his cause. As he says, ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention.""

23 December 2013,I loved the story but hated the Ending.,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",7

15 October 2005,Se7en gets a t10n from me!,"This movie takes my breath away. The story is so well constructed and the screenplay so riveting that even when you want to look away, you can't. You end up looking through your fingers! This one has everything. To go along with the writing, it has award winning performances, cinematography, set design, lighting, editing, and the opening and closing credits are a thing to behold! The director is David Fincher, but he must have gone to the Ridley Scott school. The ambiance he creates in this film is an utterly gloomy, morose and filled with dread. He sets the mood deliciously!

This movie is absolutely not recommended for anyone under 17 in my humble opinion. While it is great cinema, it is vulgar and gruesome, with scenes that could scar young minds that couldn't possibly grasp the adult ideas and content.

18 November 1998,Astounding,"It's so great to read everyone else's comments and see that other people appreciate the brilliance of this film. When I first saw Seven, the impact of it knocked me about more than any other film. On a second viewing I really got to appreciate that every aspect of this piece is extremely well done. I've seen it many times since. It's a modern masterpiece, even Hitchcock would be in awe.

4 April 2001,Films don't get much better than this. 10/10!,"This movie immediately made it into my top five and has remained there now for six years...soon to be se7en. Sorry...couldn't resist. ;^)

The cast is a dream. Morgan Freeman's negative-but-wise Detective William Somerset is the perfect counterpoint to Brad Pitt's brash, hopeful Detective David Mills. Gwyneth Paltrow, although under-used, makes an impact as Tracy Mills, David's charming, beautiful wife. and Kevin Spacey as John Doe is the most memorable. The intelligent, quiet serial-killer has almost become a cliche lately, but Spacey's performance is menacing without ever having to appear as such. He just plain creeped me out.

The pacing of this movie is perfect. Detective work is a very slow, tedious process. Fincher's direction effectively portrays it as such. The show has a few fast and furious moments, but for the most part it moves at a snail's pace, which is appropriate given the subject matter. And the tension just builds and builds...something many movies try for but few achieve.

The screenplay is also wonderful. Conversations seem real, not forced as in most movies. In Se7en, the dialogue (and the acting) made me feel as though I was looking in on the lives of the characters rather than having those characters play out a story for me.

I, unlike a few people here, thought the ending was perfect. Those who disagree with me, think about it in the context of the real world. Maybe you didn't get to see what you thought *should* have happened, but you have to admit that you saw what most likely *would* have happened.

Also, let me rebut comments which deride this film as being unnecessarily violent or a gore-fest. There were only two scenes of on-screen violence in the entire movie. One involves a gunshot on a long lens, and the other involves a close-up but barely discernable blow with a tire iron. While we see plenty of blood and guts in other scenes, we do not see the acts of violence in the majority of them.

Se7en is a perfect 10 in my books.",10
14 December 2001,"A horrific view of the world of homicide, investigation and morals.","This movie is nothing short of amazing. The more I think about it, the more I believe that I only gave it 9 instead of 10 because I didn't like the ending. And I didn't like the ending, not because it wasn't real or well written, but because it wasn't a happy ending where the good guy ""gets"" the bad guy.

This movie is incredibly deep and in the mean time, very enjoyable. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey and Gweneth Paltrow deliver masterful performances. Paltrow's performance practically ruined the movie for me because she was so convincing.

I would recommend that people own this movie. Even though it has a rap for being gross, most of the gross parts are in the mind of the viewer.

This movie is proof that the most brilliant rendering of horror is that of human imagination. It proves that movie makers who spend millions of dollars making this computer graphics monster to look scary are looking in the wrong place. There is a part where someone is starved to the point where he eats his tongue. This most cruel thought that escaped even the most twisted producers of horror movies is not even depicted. Yet, when it is simply thrown out there, you cannot help the chills that run up your spine.. It is as if you are seeing this horrible act take place.. Each one of us will imagine it in his/her own disgusting and horrific way, yet all of us will have that chill. This is because the writing of the script is so solid, and the delivery of the actors is so strong that you BELIEVE them.

The movie's plot is the story of two homicide detectives, one old and retiring, the other young and new.. Both have contradicting views that represent the old vs new conflict in its generality. The young cop still believes in good, he still believes his job is to ""catch the bad guys."" The older cop's view has changed over time to just collecting evidence, he has seen too many ""bad guys"" slip away to still believe that his work actually leads to avenging the murdered victims. One studies the mindset of the murderer, the other studies the evidence and the finger prints. They are truly a pair.

This pair is assigned a daunting task.. That of a serial killer killing through applying the seven sins on people whom he perceives are doing them. For the sin of Gluttony, he would feed an overweight man until he dies.. And so forth. The killer is creative and is unbelievably dedicated and cruel.

The movie is not simply a thriller where you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the next gruesome murder to unfold, nor is it a trivial action movie where you know the good guy won't be harmed or that the bad guy will be caught.

I would have liked to see the movie end on any different note than the one it ended on, but it's just the harsh reality that the movie wanted to deliver.

In addition to the magnificent tale, the movie deliver several warning bells, such as police personnel in police stations who share info with the press for money. Also, the idea that the FBI having a few ""flags"" over certain books and people who borrow them or buy them. These are realities of the police world that were never addressed before and are addressed effectively yet in a realistic sense in the movie.",9
20 May 2000,Not for the squeamish,"This was a great movie, but I had a very hard time watching it. It is very sadistic, very bloody, but also very thought provoking. I found myself thinking about this movie long after I returned the video to blockbuster.

Great cast. Especially surprising to me was Spacey, whom I'd just seen on the other side of the law in The Negotiator (which I also loved!)

Overall, I would've liked to see this movie done with a lot less gore, and a little more of the violence left to the audiences imagination.

18 July 2002,"Dark, twisted, psychological tale with 2 great actors","I really enjoyed this grisly serial killer mystery, but if you don't like bizarre, disgusting images or psychological terror, I wouldn't recommend seeing this film. It centers on two detectives trying to catch a killer who's murders are based on the seven deadly sins. The whole movie is dark and twisted, but very interesting. Some parts of the movie are slow, but once it gets going it keeps going. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman act wonderfully and compliment each others acting styles. The movie has a really surprising ending that really packs a punch. If it sounds interesting to you, then you should probably see it.

20 February 2003,"You GOTTA be kiddin' me, right?!?!?!","""Seven"" was one of the best detective thrillers I've seen in years. Fast paced, somewhat realistic despite Pitt's terrible acting ability in almost everything he does. A notable scene comes to mind with that said.......where he's got the gun pointed at Spacey and screaming when he knows what's in the box........that has got to be some of the WORST acting I've ever seen. I believe that Keanu Reeves might be able to do a better job, or maybe even Kathy Ireland would have done a better job as well. Anyway, despite all of that, the movie is STILL quite gripping. And yes, just because someone is a bad actor/actress doesn't mean that the movie they play in can't be great! Seven is one of those examples! Morgan Freeman, one of the greatest American actors today held that movie together along with Spacey as far as I'm concerned! Definitely worth a look!

2 August 2001,"Good, UNTIl the end","This is a very good murder mystery movie brimming with interesting scenes and characters.

This movie holds your interest from beginning to end if you have a morbid curiosity such as myself. You just yearn to see which deadly sin was used in the next murder. Morgan Freeman is excellent as usual and Brad Pitt wasn't annoying like every other film he has been in. Kevin Spacey makes a surprising entrance which makes you say ""Kevin Spacey did that?!""

This movie would be in my DVD collection right now if it didn't have such a highly depressing ending. It almost made me sick, literally. It totally takes all the steam out of the build up and leaves you feeling as if you just got punched in the stomach. I sincerely wish a different ending could have been made.

This movie should definately be seen at least once. I wouldn't want to see it again, but feel free....",

10 August 2008,"The world is not fine, but its worth fighting for","I have always believed that a great movie only comes as a result of not only good performances plus good script plus entertainment plus novelty plus technical prowess. All this has to be complemented by what the movie is trying to say, and on that respect, Se7en is a winner all the way. I see this movie as a complete portrayal of maturation for Morgan Freeman's character. Somerset from the initial frames of this movie constantly mentions the notion of 'I've had enough of this city'. All these culminates to the scene in the bar between Freeman and Pitt where Freeman's Somerset talk about apathy and justifies his views of a trodden world. But the turning point arrives when Mills tells him that Somerset wants to believe in it so that it justifies his decision to retire. After that, we see a constant culmination of the dilemma that Freeman's character undergoes up till the final point, where he remains calm and doesn't lose his grip on the things that happen around him. It is a movie about self-realization as to how Freeman realizes for himself than he is capable to handle even the worst of situations, no matter how much they hurt him. Morgan Freeman easily delivers a performance of a lifetime, and David Fincher shows his touches of brilliance, even though its pretty apparent that a stellar star cast of Freeman, Pitt, Spacey and Gwyneth easily eluded his direction. The film would have been a normal fare had any other director taken this project, because the ending might not have been altered if not for Fincher. The alteration is beautiful to say the least, this new ending certainly separates this film from being just another well-made crime thriller to a meaningful fare with themes regarding humanity and strength.",10
15 March 2021,"Great, but Predictable.","A Dark and Thrilling themed mystery plot. I am sure it had unexpected plot twists according to 1990's standards. But for someone in 2020s who has watched enough crime/mystery thriller, the future events are quite predictable. And the Logic of the last 2 murders doesn't quite fit in.

22 October 2002,"Suspense, Great Acting, Intriguing Story","If you are disturbed by dark films then this film isn't for you (apparently the previous reviewer needs Hollywood candy.) But if you like your suspense gripping, cold, with great character development, then this is a film you won't forget for both the story and its all around excellence.

While not as easily palatable as ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Seven"" is a film about a psychotic man trying to make a point about the downward spiral of our world. He's Hannibal Lector but with a purpose for killing besides mere glee. The production is astonishing, sound is fantastic (you wouldn't believe it would be in a ""cop"" film), the acting is first notch, and most of all, it made me really appreciate character development. The film delves into what basically makes two men tick and how they view the same world with completely different perspectives. Is either right?

Great care was take to make sure that the dialogue flowed as well as the pacing of the film, which picks up just as soon as you think there is a lag. Incredibly, the film is nowhere near as gruesome on screen as most other gruesome flicks (""Gladiator"" comes to mind) and it is mostly the disturbing thought that there are people like this and perhaps the world isn't a rosy place with a few freaks... or perhaps it is. The film gets better with repeated viewings and I think that this is one film where Morgan Freeman just shines as an actor. Brad Pitt actually is remarkably good as a typical American who seems to have been educated through pop culture and is quick to the hip rather than to the brain as is Somerset, Freeman's character.

If you can enjoy a movie like ""Silence of the Lambs"" then this flick will take you for a ride. If you are simply disturbed by disturbing things in this world then you might not give this movie a chance. The DVD is remarkable and perhaps the most worthwhile DVD you can get with all the interesting commentary tracks. The previous reviewer probably also thought that ""Fight Club"" -- another Fincher film -- was just a social commentary applauding violence. Like that film.... there is so much to see and appreciate in this very dark film.... Fantastic, intriguing, and replayable...",10
15 March 2003,A darkly magnificent thrill-ride,"Dark and mysterious, the ways of the film, along with it's villain. Further and further into the film you feel the fear inject itself into your veins. Untouchable performances from Freeman, Spacey and Emery but an awful performance by Brad Pitt. A little advice, don't watch the movie in the dark... at least not with your eyes open.

6 March 2021,Well packaged poop of a plot.,"I'm that guy that never correctly guesses the plot in any movie ever. Even I knew what was in that box.

However that's not why it's a bad film. It's a bad film because it has the most cringe plot iv'e ever seen. Why do imperfect people get murdered? Because they ""sin"", as Kevin Spacey says, and the 2 cops act like he's correct. The movie uses Brad Pitt's idiocy to justify Kevin Spacey's idiocy, because he too would have hurt Kevin Spacey ""if they were alone in a room"". So then Spacey's game is that ""everyone is a sinner and it's about time we point out who the sinners are"".

Of course any normal or rational person would just be like ""Well yes, the world has issues, but instead of murdering people for having flaws, maybe we should address why so many people have these flaws, and maybe by being a good person and promoting virtue and compassion, we can created a world where there's less fat and selfish people"".

The ironic thing about this film, is that it's the very kind of film that Spacey's victims would enjoy. This film is a success because messed up people think it's profound, when it's actually just a degenerate pile of dung.

And for anyone thinking it, no..........i'm not the kind of person why only enjoys butterfly and rainbow movies. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Scream are 2 films I rate highly. But Oldboy and Se7en (the better received of the 4, in this degenerate world) are dung.",2
5 May 2018,Beautiful,"Anybody reading this that likes a thriller, but hasn't seen this, watch it now! I can't really say any more without spoilers...

The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",8
6 August 2019,A movie with a lot more to say.,"The work of David Fincher in this movie is unparalleled. No one could do what David Fincher did. The story line, even if we have no background of the characters each one has their own personality and behavior and with that the movie just feels real. The performance of the detectives (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) was really good, but Kevin Spacey, as the murder did a brilliant performance, he appears late in the movie but everything he said and how he said it, make this movie one of the best Crime movies of all time. It is not just a movie, is a critic of the modern society.

29 November 1999,A real eye-opener!!,"I adored David Fincher's previous work Alien 3, and felt angered by the backlash and disrespect Dave's first movie had gotten. However, this movie shows off more of his stronger visual style. I usually have a strong stomach for grotesque films but I was taken aback by the dead carcass of the sloth victim. Very scary. And the ending is so shocking it will stay with you long after you leave the theater.

23 March 2003,Extremely Violent,"One of the most graphically violent films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The plot, story, and acting are all executed adequately, but there is an excess of violence and gore that was not necessary. I have gladly watched many violent action films including Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and war films like Saving Private Ryan, but this film combined with the movie Casino convinced me that there is a limit to the amount of gore that I am willing to sit through. Also I think I find movies about serial killers to be somewhat disturbing. Unfortunately, Hollywood seems to have seized on this as a means to a cheap thrill instead of producing more thought-provoking crime dramas like Chinatown.

13 October 1999,DISH MOVIE WASH SHOOO SHTUCKING SHWEET!!!!!,"This was an AWESOME movie... Morgan Freeman is an awesome actor, but Kevin Spacey really steals the show, he plays John Doe so perfectly, and the ending really is the best part of this movie, because Kevin Spacey a great actor and can play psychos so well (but he showed us he can play losers just as well in A.B.). The entire movie leads up to the extraordinarily surprising ending, even though the director wants you to think that the ending is going to be really big, and still surprises you. Spacey's half hour part in the movie is one of the best endings i've ever seen. I say again... DISH MOVIE WASH SOHOOO SHTUCKING SHWEET!!!!!

27 September 2001,very involving.,"The way the story builds is very entralling. The technical aspects of the movie like sound effects, screenplay, is so good that it is not noticeable at all, you simply get into the story. There is a scene where the camera looks at the car going away from the city into the plains between powerlines and all that.. the peculiar feel I got during that scene is quite indescribable and unforgetable. One among the best made movies I have seen.

18 August 2022,Good Concept,"The subject of seven sins were an interesting choice and its portrayal was duly made. However the plot was pretty much guessable in my opinion which kind of made the story progress obsolete. Kudos on the philosophical aspect though.

8 March 2020,Take the ride...,"A lot has been said/written in these reviews about this movie. There is not much more that I can add. I have seen this movie about 3 times (spaced out) and each time I get that feeling...where is this leading me? I understand about the 7 deadly sins but is it that cut and dry? The movie is not complex and actually walks you through so it feels predictable but in a strange and very rare way it is not. My advice is to relax, put the kids to bed and watch as this movie takes you on a little journey. In the end, if you have sat through this with minimal disruption, you will be left shaking your head in total disbelief... I'll watch it again in about 3 years. Not really a spoiler but there is something interesting in the opening credits... also to get the full effect don't watch any of the trailers!

8 July 2000,"Predictable, insipid, boring.","I have never understood why so many people consider this movie a great thriller. It has a few spooky & exciting moments, but overall it is terribly predictable and disappointing. Brad Pitt is insufferable, and the old, wise cop vs. young, arrogant rookie thing has been done to death in better movies than this one. There is little here that is original or creative--it's fine for a rental, but I'm sorry I wasted my money when it was in the theaters.

6 August 2011,A Modern Classic Crime Thriller,"Se7en, directed by the at the time relatively new director David Fincher(who would go on to make fight club and the social network), still stands as the greatest crime thriller since its release.

The film tells the story of two detectives: Morgan Freeman as the calm close-to-retirement cop, and Brad Pitt as his young cocky partner. Their partnership may seem clichés but the chemistry between the two actors is brilliant. Both actors give some of the best performances of their career's. The supporting cast also does well too including: Gwyneth Paltrow , R. Lee Ermey and Kevin Spacey.

The film is told very differently to most cop drama, going for a more depressing look at the world and the city, as the story follows the cops trying to take down a killer who is murdering people in a style of the seven sins. And the story works well throughout with loads of plot twists and turns and a brilliant ending that still ranks among the best film endings ever.

The action keeps moving from fast paced chase scenes to the slowly-paced crime scene investigations. David Fincher manages to tell a moving and emotional story that also mixes little bits of dark humor with some well directed action scenes.

In total if you haven't seen Se7en yet then I'd recommend you go and see it soon, as its one of the best crime thrillers ever made, and features two great actors on top form.",8
13 July 2017,Very Good Thriller,"Seven is a very good crime thriller. It has a wonderful script. It doesn't focus on the brutality and violence of the crime, but focuses on the investigation. It also looks at the relationship between a veteran cop who has seen it all and the rookie who is naive and wants to save the world. David Fincher did a wonderful directing with the use of darkness and continuous rain. Also all the detail in the incredible title sequences and crime scenes. The cast was very good with incredible performances by Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Seven is a very good movie. It is one of the best thrillers to come out of the 1990's. It is also one of David Fincher best movie. It is very good thriller.

30 September 1999,a disturbing cinematic masterpiece. definitely worth watching,"this twisted tale slowly leads us to the climax which is subsequently the end of the movie. throughout the film, there were varying signs which indicated that this was just an average police movie but the end of this movie shattered that whole connotation. spacey was brilliant in this film as he is in every one of his films. the part was created for him, one of the best decisions the casting director made. freeman's acting was fairly good which basically covered pitt's lesser than brilliant performance.

1 November 1999,Wonderful dark psychological thriller,"Disturbing yet compelling, Se7en is the last great dark thriller that I've seen. With tour de force performances by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (and an gripping uncredited appearance by my favorite actor, Kevin Spacey,) Se7en takes you on a gripping journey through the mean streets of New York City, as a veteran and a rookie detective track down a serial killer who murders to set an example that the seven deadly sins are the causes of society's eminent demise.

Cinematography and sound are brilliant and the murders are so horrifying, yet your eyes are glued to the screen for the entire time. If you don't mind graphic, grotesque depictions of murder and you love psychological thrillers with first-rate actors, this is the film for you. Don't be fooled by the Se7en rip-offs that have surfaced in the past few years (Kiss the Girls, The Bone Collector.) This is the genuine article.

5 April 2006,Chilling and Memorable Thriller,"7 gruesome murders. Each gruesome for any number of reasons.

One of the darkest and most disturbing thrillers ever, David Fincher's Se7en set a benchmark when released that has rarely if at all been matched since. In only his second ever film, Fincher takes us on a roller-coaster ride of religious fanaticism that shocks, intrigues and horrifies the audience.

Morgan Freeman is a week away from retirement. Brad Pitt is a week away from replacing him. The pair form an unlikely pair during the curious case of a morbidly obese man who appears to have been forced to eat himself to death. Somerset (Freeman) believes that it is the beginning. Mills (Pitt) thinks that it is simple ironic torture. However, a second man is found bled to death, with greed written on the crime scene floor. A second trip to the first location reveals the word gluttony behind a fridge. Soon the unlikely duo find themselves hunting a killer who appears to be using the seven deadly sins as both his template and as a murder weapon.

Fincher's piece of cinematic brilliance is a roller-coaster ride of exhilaration, shock, revulsion and curiosity, and shows a flair of direction that Fincher would later show in Fight Club. His use of directorial techniques, such as his eradication of colour and light from his dark, wet and gloomy sets creates a near nightmare like brooding universe which simply adds to the sinister nature of the investigation. Unsurprisingly, the murders are horrific to say the least, although much is actually left to the audience's imagination. The unconventional partnership of Freeman and Pitt is entertaining, with Pitt resenting Freeman's almost patronising wisdom, with Freeman hating Pitt's gung ho, unsubtle attitude. Both excel in their roles, as does Gwyneth Paltrow as Mills' frustrated wife. R. Lee Ermey and John C. McGinley, are, much like the rest of the supporting cast, well judged and make good work of their small roles. However, the most eye catching performance is by the unexpected Kevin Spacey as the killer. Although he doesn't have much screen time, he is terrifying as the righteous and almost serene John Doe, convinced that he is doing God's work, and carrying it out with cold cunning and confirmed enthusiasm. It's this planning that paves way for the stunning conclusion, that is both shocking and brilliantly set up.

The big star, though, is Fincher. The director redeems himself brilliantly following the much slated Alien 3, using unconventional techniques ,the creation of a sinister atmosphere, his control of events as well as the pacing that help make the film so memorable.

That and the seven gruesome murders, of course.",10
9 June 2021,Incredible storytelling and screenplay,"Being a movie enthusiast and experiencing many movies, its rare to find one this perfectly made. Morgan freeman was very well cast as his acting style perfectly fits the character detective Somerset, and Bradd Pitt's impeccable versatility of skills and prowess makes his character stand out

What I like most about the movies is the philosophical significance behind it. At times it goes to great lengths to set the theme and portray the brutality of the story.

In my mind its one of the best movies i have come across and has left me with a wish to experience it again like the first time.

2 November 2021,a city steeped in sins,"""We are stupid and funny dolls participating in some vile circus performance. What's the use of dancing and copulating, we don't even care about the World. We don't know that we don't know anything. We are not what we thought we were."" The first thing I want to say is that this film is amazing. I frankly don't like detective stories, but David Fincher's film ""Seven"" drags.

The picture captures from the first minutes and keeps you in suspense until the very end.

It is rare to find a film that makes you think, listen to dialogues in the most meticulous way, and constantly analyze. This is exactly the case here. The tape is simply replete with various thoughts. For example: how long have you been visiting the library? Or read a book.

Serious intrigue, plot intricacies and mind-blowing finale, makes this movie a wonderful thriller.

Neonoire is shown perfectly, except for cliches like: constant rain.

Conclusion: A wonderful detective thriller, for those who want to think while watching. The ending will not leave anyone indifferent. Spoiler: it's over so you can't tell if this ending is bad or good.

As a fan of crime thrillers (Zodiac is one of my favourite modern films) I expected this to be mind blowing. It's a pretty standard mystery that's way too long. It's alright, certainly not a classic. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman deliver solid performances, although it's not enough to save this largely forgettable thriller. The ending bunks this film up to a 6/10.

7 November 2009,Flawless!,"I have to say that this movie is so well done, everything carefully planned, it is for me Flawless! The idea itself is very unique, and the killings are very imaginative. While watching this movie, I was told it is best, not to miss a minute of this movie, for every scene, every moment, is a valuable clue to solving a mystery. This movie is amazing. One thing about the movie is that it is very dark, as in simply colour, even in bright daylight, scenes are dark. The sets are very good, and the acting is great, Brad Pitt suits the part perfectly. It could not have been done better. The ending, however is just overpowering, just.... fantastic! The twist at the end is never to be expected, not one human on this earth could have guessed it, this movie is so cleverly made, I recommend this to almost anyone, that loves a mystery, and some gore, as well, as a movie with wonderful structure.

28 December 2003,A great thriller,"Seven is an amazing and gory police/criminal thriller with lots of gory moments and great performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. This is David Fincher's best film, it is dark, scary, grim and gives a new meaning to the word ""rain"". It is hard to write a review about this film. Warning: this is not easy viewing. The ending is one of the best i've ever seen and a great twist. As we travel with the detectives to each murder we no that he is not joking and it won't end pretty. I won't let to much information out about this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.

4 May 2023,Intelligent and gripping,"Although the pace was quite slow at times, it makes up for it for the incredibly well written script. I think this is probably one of the most complicated plot a movie has (ofc its not as complicated as tv shows). The crime scenes were done really well and just lets the viewers use their imagination to picture how brutally each victim was murdered. The villian didn't just kill the victims just because he simply needed to for the plot to develop but he killed them because in his sick head, he thought he was doing the right thing and that makes him a character with actual depth. The ending is just so well thought out and there were several little nuggets throughout the movie that helps develop the story to that point. If you can't handle plot development because you have the attention span of a worm then don't watch this movie, but overall 10 out of 10.

15 March 2006,That 'Lust' Kill Was Sooo Hottt,"Seven, or ""Se7en"" if you like your movies to have numbers sprinkled randomly in their titles, has Morgan Freeman in it.

Need I say more?

Okay, it does also have Brad Pitt, who is doing his usual early Brad Pitt schtick of acting a bit like a spastic heroin-addicted monkey.

Anyway, Morgan Freeman. Also, Morgan Freeman and Morgan Freeman's brilliant portrayal of Morgan Freeman.

To be fair, the Morgan Freeman is not just about Morgan Freeman. It's also got a lot of sweet, inventive death in it of the most awesome, disturbing kind. Apparently, it has something to deal with Keyser Soze, but I wasn't paying that much attention to the plot when I watched it. I was more just gawking at the awesome production design, (Satan wishes Hell looked this awesome) and the awesomeness of the disturbingness, and the awesomeness of the Morgan Freeman.

That Fight Club guy directed this, so it looks like the most depressing Sprite commercial ever. There's a lot of rain, which is sort of cool, and it also has Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in it, which is really cool. Although he should have gouged out John Doe's eyes and done that skull thing to him. That would have made it cooler. Or Brad Pitt's eyes. Either way it's equally cool.

But mostly this Morgan Freeman is pretty Morgan Freeman.",9
18 March 1999,A reprehensible piece of trash,"I cannot understand the acclaim this film received, nor how it could by any stretch of the imagination be considered entertaining. I rented ""Seven"" expecting a taut, suspenseful thriller. Instead, it was the ugliest, most reprehensible piece of trash I have ever seen.

In general I am not opposed to violence in films, provided it is not excessive or gratuitous. But in ""Seven,"" the admittedly intriguing premise--a serial murderer who kills to enact the seven deadly sins--serves as nothing more than a pretext to show scene after scene of the most lurid and nauseating footage imaginable on the large (or small) screen.

I recently noticed that ""Seven"" was broadcast on network prime time television, and that TV Guide gave no warning advising viewer discretion. I wonder why this film should be shown at all (I imagine it would have to be heavily edited), and why the network would not be more responsible in protecting children (not to mention sensitive adults) from its content.

Normally I wouldn't dignify such trash by writing a review of it. But if my comments prevent just one unsuspecting viewer from seeing this sickening piece of garbage, then they will have been worthwhile. I wish someone had done the same for me.",

6 November 1999,I don't know what everyone sees in this movie.,"I don't understand why people think this is a good movie. The plot is predictable yet not really believable, the hero is unlikeable and the villain, who is supposed to be the movie's moral foundation (go figure *that* one), ultimately pulls the rug out from underneath the movie at the end.

The scene where Brad Pitt allows the killer to escape was irritatingly hard to believe. And what was the Gynneth Paltrow character's (not to mention her unborn child) sin? The killer was careful to choose people who (at least in his mind) deserved to die yet at the crucial climax he completely broke with his pattern in a most incredible way.

And where does a ""moral"" serial killer come from? Seems like an oxymoron, but of course in the end we see that he's not moral after all. Still, the whole concept rings hollow and leaves one wondering what the point of the movie was anyway? It seems like it was just a story created to give the film makers a chance to show grisly murder scenes one after another in an attempt to shock us.

If you want to see a much better movie along these lines (and much more disturbing because it's believable), watch ""Henry, the Portrait of a Serial Killer."" And be sure to give it a higher vote than this turkey.",4
18 March 1999,Horror movie that actually scares you.,"Great movie. Yet Se7en is also one that will leave you with images in your head not soon forgotten. This brilliant, though extremely dark movie was handled masterfully by Alien 3 and 8mm director David Fincher. Excellent cinematography sets the mood in just the right way to scare the bejesus out of you. Regardless of whether you like it or not, you will not forget this movie. Powerful performances by Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Gwyneth Paltrow help this movie along swiftly, and without much error. But the real winner in this movie was Kevin Spacey as John Doe. He portrays a psychopath killer, yet gives his character a certain dignity. When he tells Pitt his reasons for the graphic murders, you can understand why he did it. Not that it makes it right, though. An incredible surprise ending that will shock you and stick with you for a long time after seeing the movie, rounds out the movie. Excellent flick, though certainly not for young eyes, this is a near-perfect movie, and I give it a 9.

2 December 1999,Great horror,"Well, I have seen this film for the first time almost two years ago, and I still think this is the movie with the biggest ""amount"" of tense that I have ever seen. Scenario is great, very dark and pessimistic, great review of a world today, although sometimes to extreme. Morgan Freeman was true discovery to me; I was astonished with this actor and his great performance.Brad Pitt was also excellent; he represents detectives of today; light on head and heavy on hands (or at least on behavior). David Fincher with this one and ""The Game"",I would dare to say, is on footprints of some of the Hitchcock's best movies, and it would be very interesting to see what is next.

31 December 2019,Dark and suspenseful buddy cop thriller with twists and turns.,"Influential director David Fincher launched an impressive mainstream career with Se7en. Countless films and tv-series have been inspired or downright copied the opening sequence. Other films like 8mm and ect have tried to hit the same nerve, themes and mood as Se7en but nothing beats the original. There is nothing feel-good about this dark film. It is set in a rainy metropol challenged by brutality and violence. The themes of the film revolves around the worst aspects of humanity and whether it is worth keeping on fighting the good fight or we should just give up because of the meaninglessness of it all. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are portraying the two main characters William Somerset and David Mills. They are one of the best unlikely buddy cop pairs ever seen on the big screen. Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect portraying the sympathetic and worried wife of Mills. Kevin Spacey is menacing as the everyday man John Doe with fanatic plans for society. This is a must-see for everyone and is arguably the best film of David Finchers career which contains several classics.

Highly recommend!",10
26 February 2001,old story done well,"The story of a murderer committing his crimes to preach to the world is a great idea for a movie, and it was carried out very well. The story of a retiring cop teamed with his new replacement is a story that has been recycled over and over. But it was done extremely well in Seven. This movie is full of suspense. Both Pitt and Freeman give wonderful, believable performances. The movie is somewhat gruesome, but if you can stomach some violence, it is well worth watching.

24 April 2002,"Gritty and enthrolling, it's one of the best films of our time","Se7en is one of those films that you will remember for a long, long time. Everything about it from the lighting to the acting makes this film fantastic. From the biggening, Se7en keeps the audience enthrolled to the suprise ending.

The lighting of Se7en gives it a film noir feeling throughout. By allowing the lighting to help tell the story Fencher gives the film a ominous and forboding feeling. Very entertaining. I highly recomend this movie.

12 July 2022,No thank you,"Some creative kills and a decent atmosphere fail to obscure a vapid nihilism, rather meandering plot with a twist that makes little sense, and some quite nasty misogyny. Basically two or three admittedly masterful performances away from being nothing more than a padded ultra-violent bad Law and Order episode. The Brakhage-inspired title sequence is orders of magnitude better than the film itself. The hodgepodge of contextless references to classic literature doesn't make this any cleverer, either. This is basically everything that people who don't watch ""film bro movies"" unfairly think all modern thrillers are like. Has aged horribly as well.

10 July 2018,David Fincher's hauntingly grim masterpiece,"By the year Seven came out David Fincher was already being considered as one of those sleek auteur whose work have a distinctive style and richness. Here he teams up with Brad Pitt (one of the many collaborations they've been a part of) and Morgan Freeman to create one of the finest thriller dramas of the 90s. Seven also contains one of the greatest bad guy performances in Kevin Spacey. Containing one of the most shocking finales this film reeks of atmosphere and grim. Watch this film right away.

20 May 2002,What to say,"I must say this is one of the best movies of all time but there are a contradiction, a logic mistake in the movie that I can't get around.

The fulfillment of John Doe's horrifying plan is based around David Mills (Brad Pitt) and his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow). John Doe envy Mills wife, that's is sin. And when Mills kills him he is punished and in the same time Mills wrath is punished by letting Doe win and the fact that is wife is dead.

The plan of John Doe has been planned for a long time. The victim of sloth has been tied up in his bed precisely a year. So we can be sure of the fact that John Doe has planned it at least a year.

We also learn that Mills and his wife have recently moved to the nameless city because of Mills new job. They have only lived there four a week or something.

Then we can see that when John Doe started his sinister plan he didn't know about Mills and his Wife. His sin wasn't obvious.

Of course we could say that he could have picked another woman, another victim for his own sin (envy). But then it wouldn't have been an inspector. Freeman character is unwed so he is excluded. It had to be an investigator of the gruesome murders to have worked the way he had planned.

This is just a thought that I got. But I don't see anything wrong about it. For me there exist a loophole in Se7en, which is a big disappointment.

But hey, ignore that and have a lot of fun watching this otherwise spectacular and horrifying movie.

9/10 (degraded after the discovery)",8
21 July 2005,Body language,"""Se7en"" is one of my all time favorite films. It has stayed with me ever since my first viewing. I must have seen it 6-7 times and I still get a quiver down my spine, when I watch certain scenes. I don't think I can say this is true of very many other films.

I think the reason why this film made such an impression on me is because it speaks to the intellect thorough the body and visa versa. It makes it evident that although western civilization has subscribed to the vision of the separation between body/mind, we cannot separate these to entities in our experience of reality. We cannot exactly determine whether we make decisions based upon gut-reactions or if we make them through reasoning.

The first part of the film plays mainly upon the capacity of the viewer at imagining physical pain. The best example being the pimp who has been lying in his bed for a year, but who is still alive. The first time I saw that scene, I felt nauseous and disgusted. I thought of it as a straight forward gut-reaction, this man who has suffered such pain, and he is still alive.

The darkness of the city, the bleakness of the future for people living there coupled with the acute presence of tenderness in the characters also strikes me. Once again I had a very physical reaction to the scene where Somerset speaks Mills' wife about her being pregnant. Although he himself has chosen not to bring up children in such a harsh world he says ""If you decide to have them, spoil them every way that you can."" Every time I see this scene I find myself crying.

When we finally reach the end of the film, when we are transported from the rainy dark city to the open and nowhere-to-hide place where John Doe wants to deliver his package. The dialog of the serial killer has the same effect on me every time - I get a stomach ache... The brilliance of it all being that I cannot exactly explain where this stomach ache comes from. Do I get a stomach ache simply because this man is such an eloquent incarnation of evil? Or is it mainly because I cannot help but agree with some of the things that he is saying? ""Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial.""

John Doe has a lot in common with Somerset, who also feels despair at the way of the world: ""I just don't think I can continue to live in a place that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was virtue.""

John Doe's actions, his evil master plan marks him as an insane person, who has transgressed the taboos of a ""civilised"" society, even though his deed was to punish other transgressors.

Throughout the film we have had to imagine all the terrible deeds that John Doe performed on people of - granted - questionable moral dispositions. We get to see him, and listen to his tale. However appalling his actions are, the actual fact that I as a viewer can agree with some of the things that he is saying turns the physical nausea of imagination from the first part into a kind of intellectual nausea... How can I agree with him even a little bit? This in turn once again creates a physical reaction - a stomach ache. I get a physical reaction as a response to my own reasoning.

It reminds me that we all have some type of evil within us, we want pedophiles and evil lawyers to get what they deserve. We can imagine doing something to put things right. But we wouldn't ever do it - that would make us insane. We can imagine this exactly the way the film has let us imagine the pain afflicted, but not let us see it.

In short, my fascination with this film comes from the fact that it speaks to the intellect through the body and visa versa. It shows me how experience cannot really be separated into body/soul. At the same time as it shows me exactly how much I experience the mind and the body to be two separated entities.

A true masterpiece!",10
21 September 2020,Perfect masterpiece!!!!,"I watched this film more than 10 times, and i still remember the intense and thrill which this film brought me.

I was never really sure what my favorite movie was til this. The story is dark and gruesome. You care about your two detectives. I love the darkness of the shots in this movie, even when it is sunny it is still darker. The ending, is by far my favorite movie ending of all time. 100% recommended.

14 June 2007,Loathe this movie,"It's rare when I can't find something to appreciate about a movie, but this is one of them. I loathe this film. It is horrifically violent and graphic. Truly disturbing, and I am not particularly squeamish. I like thrillers and the occasional horror flick, but this was over the top. I wish movies like this were never made - they can't be good for the public in general. If we keep ""advertising"" for extreme violence by making films like this, no one should be surprised when we get it. Exercising a little restraint and common sense for the good of society wouldn't hurt Hollywood, but they are much more interested in their profits than anything else.

1 August 2001,A disturbing murder mystery,"In my opinion this is one of the finest murder mysteries to have come out in the 90's. Sure, the movie had a fairly unoriginal plot and structure, but so did Gladiator and Braveheart, and they won best picture. But that's not even the point, the point is, the movie works with the structure and plot.

The film is a well put together investigation film with an interesting idea. Add to that, the fine performances of Morgan Freeman and John Doe(I can not tell you who plays him for fear of giving away something). And usually I don't like Brad Pitt but he fits his role in this film perfectly. Also, there is the new and innovative shooting style of David Fincher which have become some of his signature trademarks: the dull lighting, bleak atmosphere, always accompanied by a feeling of dread. Some people have complained about how it always rains in the film but I feel that it only adds to the movie's distinct feel.

4 December 2002,"Where would we be now without David Fincher's ""Se7en""?","When Silence of the Lambs was released and proved a huge success, the new fad in Hollywood were serial killer films such as this one. None were as good or made the same back, until filmmaker David Fincher did a 180 from the much-hated Alien 3 and made this film. You can tell that Fincher had always had a love for films, but Alien 3 was a bit ridiculous to put into the hands of a new filmmaker.

With Se7en, we have a great-looking, dark, murky and just plain beautiful film. Every shot you can tell has been weighed and examined to ensure every frame of film is worthy of being put on a wall with a frame.

But looks aren't everything.

The two detectives have very deep characters and turn in two of the best performances in their careers; Fincher took close care to the style and art of the film, but didn't forget about his actors.

Combine this with a fantastic ending and a screenplay that has been outright plagurized in the past but never done nearly as well, and you have a classic on your hands. Mark my words, fifty years from now it'll still be held in as high regard because of how trandescending the story it tells is.

Ahead of it's time, I'd say.",
30 March 2003,"Two detectives, a serial killer and lots of blood","Two years ago I saw this movie in my English class. It was directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. I was starred by Brad Pitt as Det. David Mills, Morgan Freeman as Det. Lt. William Somerset and Gwyneth Paltrow as Tracy Mills.

The story was set in present day New York. It is a police drama about two cops, one new and one about to retire, and a serial killer, Kevin Spacey as John Doe, who uses the seven deadly sins as his motto.

While I was watching the film I felt really anxious because it is full of suspense. This story has lots of mystery and bloody scenes. I would recommend this for those people who like suspense films because it has the best cast and it's very interesting.

Baby has hearing problems after the crash that killed his parents. He is constantly listening to music to alleviate the symptoms. He owes money to Doc and is working it off.

8 September 2003,Greatest thriller of all time.,"This movie is so unbelieveably good. If you like thrillers, this is a must. It's actually even better than ""Silence of the Lambs"", and a little bit more shocking. Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman are excellent in their characters, and Kevin Spaceys outstanding ""input"" in the end is absolutely awesome.

The first time I saw this movie I was so impressed, I just ran down to the videoshop and bought it.

You simply HAVE to watch this movie, it is so well-acted, well-directed and has an exceptional script.

11 February 2012,chill down the spine....,"Today is 11/2/2011 just about 16 years since the release.Don't judge me on the account that what was I doing for last decade to miss out on such master piece.well I did see the movie decade ago but today wanted to brush-up with a more mature prospective.

These last 16 years saw dawn of many suspense thriller with antisocial and dark base but by far this one is the leader of the pact.Sharing the table with ""silence of the lamb"" it did put blood and evil on the table but left audience to garnish and savour.What was so amazing was the fact that without any cutting and slicing and on just mention of them just send a chill down the spine.The direction was clever enough to give hint to the dark circumstance and lead into a claustrophobic background and let the imagination go wild.

Story was no doubt the stronger of the lot and ending did make sense.The twist and turns and finally the ending was totally unexpected.I would like to write about it but wouldn't want to give away the whole experience of it.

Cast with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt was in all fairness to the character or out of exaggeration I may say maybe it was meant for them.Freeman all experienced,exhausted and Brad Pitt young,agile although stereotype brought the much seriousness required.And kevin spacey which I noticed is not even in the first page of cast and crew requires much admiration for the negative role although small but major to the finish.

Over all strong plot, direction, cinematography, cast, acting and chill. A well deserved 9/10. I would further recommend for time to time brush- up to experience all the said above all over again.",9
25 October 2004,"Seen SE7EN, Saw SAW","Without blowing too much smoke up David Fincher's blowpipe, this has to be one of the finest 21st Century horror movies that has managed to pass the censor's blade.

Look for tension - it's there. Look for disturbing images - it's there. Look for quality acting - it's there. Look for the future of the genre - it's there. And then some.

Put the disc/tape in, and prepare yourself for nothing less than your favourite theme park ride whilst being spiked with LSD on a Tuesday. It's that good.

Many have commented on this movie, but the only experience IS the experience. Enjoy - if you claim the status of 21st Century Boy/Girl. If not, stick to Hammer. (4.5 / 5)

7 October 2005,good,"This thriller, that doesn't really thrill, is more interesting as a character study and a dark expression of the 20th Century. The films story is set over 7 days in New York where Detective David Mills, (Brad Pitt), has just transferred, he is partnered with Detective William Somerset, (Morgan Freeman). Over the course of a week a series of murders occur based on the seven deadly sins; Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Envy and Wrath. The two detectives hunt the killer down like prey only to discover that they themselves are the prey.

Genius is not a word that I use lightly but it is an adequate description of Seven. The whole film reeks of class and intelligence with this quality exuding from its two main characters. Although polar opposites Mills and Somerset provide an interesting combination with Mills' impatient and impulsive mannerism's opposing Somerset's more thoughtful and calculated actions. This pattern is used most subtly with the films sound as Mills is always make some kind of noise whether tapping a pen or talking inanely he clutters the silence that Somerset appreciates so much.",8

24 October 2020,The worst movie ever made,"I have seen hundreds of movies but this one was so bad I had to make an account on IMDB to warn others.

If you're looking for a good action movie, just stay away. If you're looking for good acting, stay away. If you're looking for something entertaining or something to add to your beautiful day/life run away!

This movie starts with the typical 90's cliche detectives, Brad Pitt really done his absolute worst here, not that he could ever act. Morgan Freeman is always sympathetic which is why this movie is rated 2 stars and not 1.

I won't spoil it for you but I can assure you it would leave you with a sense of disgust and dread that cannot be washed away easily. Cliches one after another, with no plot, nothing to be discovered other than the world (this movie for sure) is a really sad thing. Predictable in all stages, outdated and allround bad in every aspect. Boring is not, they try to lead to somewhere that... isn't. Hence the disappointment.

I'm aware I'm maybe alone in my opinion but that doesn't bother me much, I honestly want to help people have a better day. Nothing I can think of can wash away the horror of these lost moments of my life that I will never get back. Do yourself a favour and watch something with a plot, see ""The Room"" maybe, it has more value than this, at least you'll get a laugh out of it.",2

7 February 1999,"Indescribably tense, and truly shocking","I made the mistake of going to see this film a second time before I had had time to assimilate the first viewing. I was nearly sick from the tension.... The punishment for Pride had me gasping with fear.

All the main characters are unlikeable, to the extent that you really don't care how badly things go for them. Amazingly Gwyneth Paltrow portrays a character so weak and spineless, so unsympathetic, that my sympathies almost lay with the psychopathic Kevin Spacey - almost. Is there no end to this woman's talents?

Very unpleasant, and deeply disturbing. Unmissable, but not for the faint hearted.

I wasted my time watching this, so you don't have to. I did sample IMDB reviews to avoid committing time for a bad film like this one. But I feel like cheated. This has to be one of the the biggest IMDb user rating failures. Or did we watched the same movie?

9 December 1999,"Dark, Grim, Compelling","It was in Alien3, that director David Fincher first made his mark: while the script may have been flawed, the acting mundane(save the ever-reliable Weaver) and the plot muddled, the film stayed afloat thanks to the fact that it simply oozed dark style. With Se7en, however, Fincher gets an opportunity to stamp his visual flair on a more-than-competent script, and a jaw-dropping cast(Freeman, Pitt, Spacey et al), and, predictably, an utterly compelling film results.

For a serial-killer film, Se7en has surprisingly little on-screen blood letting. However the depiction of a nightmarish city and ample forensic detail, together with taut acting and tense direction, means that it is at times an almost unbearably grim suspenser. Pitt delivers his lines with twitching intensity, but is far more restrained than in his manic performance in 12 Monkeys. Freeman is marvellously understated as a detective looking forward to retirement who is drawn into the grisly case which Pitt initially undertakes. Best of all, though, is Spacey, who > has a mammoth screen presence, albeit only being present on-screen for a relatively short period.

Overall Se7en is a relentlessly downbeat yet mightily impressive film. Not since The Silence of the Lambs has there been a psychological thriller with such an oppressive atmosphere and soaring energy as this. But while Lambs swept the Oscars in 1991(the only truly contemporary film to win the Best Picture award during the 90s) the Academy only managed to nominate Se7en for one Oscar(that for editing, which is admittedly superb). While Se7en is not quite as masterful as Lambs, it ought to have won at least a few more nominations(how Freeman was left out of the Best Actor category, one would never know).

The only reservation I'd have about Se7en is than Fincher at times tends to overdo the depressing plot developments. Certainly, the viewer can find little refuge or comfort in the ending, which means that the easily upset may want to steer clear; instead they might want to catch The Game, which has all of Fincher's visual flair and intensity, minus the downbeat tone. Otherwise Se7en comes highly recommended.

12 January 2000,The only reason I can think anyone would watch this is to be shocked. Why not just search the internet a little bit and see more shocking images free of charge?,"This whole movie is about shocking you, you can see more shocking scenes on the internet for free. I HATE movies that insult my tolerence level and assume a description of something Really Bad happening and a few aftermath pictures will make me uncomfortable. I found Dead Man Walking's rape/murder scenes a lot more disturbing then this trash.

The ending was not intelligent at all and had no point other then to make the audience go ""OH MY GOD!!"", please. I perfer 8mm over se7en and day of the week, at least it makes you think a little bit.

24 October 1999,Kevin Spacey stole the show!,"I liked everything about this movie. It seemed like the pacing was particulary slow purposely to let the viewer think. But Fincher has created an excellent movie. I liked Pitt here, and Freeman was excellent as usual. But the one who steals the whole movie is the one and only Kevin Spacey. I cant tell you how much I love this guy. He is the best contemporary actor today. He should have gotten a supporting nod for this role. I can watch the scene at the end when there taking the killer to see the supposedly two dead bodies over and over again. Spacey just hypnotizes me when he speaks. He should get Best Actor this year for American Beauty...he was amazing there and he was amazing here!

22 September 2010,Seven and Silence Of The Lambs,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

23 June 2002,A brilliant Stylized Thrillier! One of the best films of the 90's,"On the subway today, a man came up to me to start a conversation. He made small talk, a lonely man talking about the weather and other things. I tried to be pleasant and accommodating, but my head hurt from his banality. I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I suddenly threw up all over him. He was not pleased, and I couldn't stop laughing.'



David Fincher's `Seven' is a beautifully crafted film about something more then it seems. The whole film seems as if it is an orgy of gore and gothic themes, but (simply) it isn't. `Seven' seems gory but truly on a visual basis it isn't. It gives you thoughts that will make you think different. It is so mentally visual. There is hardly anything in it, visually, that would shock you. Yet people seem to refer to it as a gory disgusting film, I disagree. It makes you think about everything and makes it worse if it came right out and put it on the film. I am surprised to say but as I look back on every film I have seen this situation has never come up. This is the only film really to gross the viewer out without doing anything amazingly shocking, visually.



It (like all of Fincher's films) is so different from everything else out there. I love its `evil look' sort of like everything was under water then uncorked dry. It has a `wet' texture and such a beautiful light to it. It does so much more then it could have done. Not falling for right angle turns in the plot, or stupid one liners. It is different and undoubtedly stylish. The film centers around a serial killer who has been centering his murders around the seven deadly sins. Two cops, one about to retire (Somerset), and one new on the job (Mills) are put on the case. The film seems so simple but truly is one of the best cop movies ever made. It is a very disturbing masterwork that has beautiful direction by one of my favorite directors David Fincher. The film would not be anything if it weren't for him, he brings his style to the film like Scorsese or the late Kubrick did. His direction is flawless and it always has been. In his other two films (Fight Club, The Game) he seems to direct with perfection as those are both very amazing films. His style is so obvious you could see a scene from any of his films and know who directed them. Plus it is so very involving with the brilliant acting of one of the greatest actors of our time Morgan Freeman and one of the greatest up and comers Brad Pitt. Some deceive Pitt as a pretty boy but the man can act beautifully and this film is his best film along with Freemen's. The film is a character film, it has so much depth in cinematography and so much punch to it's plot that it gives the actors their chance to shine, plus it opens the door to one of my favorite actors (can't tell it would spoil it). The sick part of this film is that I sympathize with the killer he is truly right. But in the end, wrong. Still he does have a point.



`We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. And what I've done is going to be puzzled over, and studied, and followed... forever.'



`Seven' at it's heart is a statement on the worlds declining morality, Like `The Godfather,' `A Clockwork Orange,' and so many before it. It shocks but makes a very important statement with that shock, we as people are evil and not fearing of any consequence. `Seven' does this perfectly it seems to tell you one heck of a good story and give the viewer something to think about about. The film is one of the only pieces of art the nineties brought. It is one of the best thrillers ever made and one of the smartest. David Fincher's `Se7en' is a must see film and one of my favorites.



`Ernest Hemingway once wrote, ""The world is a fine place and worth fighting for."" I agree with the second part.'",
15 April 2001,Seven is a great film but its harsh brutality is not for everybody.,"Seven is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Andrew Kevin Walker takes what seems to be on the surface an unoriginal concept and makes it his own, producing one of the most original screenplays of the 90's. David Fincher does a find job as the director of Seven. His direction compliments the gritty screenplay nicely. Howard Shore gives us a great subtle and ominous musical score. Darius Khondji's cinematography also pays respect to the script by making the images on screen very dark. If Seven has any faults it's in the performances and pacing. Even these faults are minor. Brad Pitt is pretty good as the cocky detective, David Mills, but he could be more dramatic in some of his more emotional scenes. Morgan Freemen is good but I feel that he underplays his character, William Somerset, a bit too much sometimes. Kevin Spacey gives the best performance of the film as the psychopath, John Doe. He speaks his lines with cold brutality. He is riveting to watch. Seven's pacing is good for the most part; one or two scenes tend to drag on a bit too long, however. Seven is a great film, though, and a cinematic gem of the 90's.

20 December 2001,"a good, but flawed movie","Before seeing this movie, I was expecting great things. All of my friends who had seen it before me had told me what a great movie it was. It was good, a taught thriller that was quite satisfying. Until the ending, that is, which was the worst cop out of an ending that I could imagine for this film.

Up until the very last four minutes of this film, I would have rated it a 10. The cinematography was fantastic, the acting by Morgan Freeman and R. Lee Emery in particular fantastic. Also, Kevin Spacey was very good as John Doe, but there was something particularly hollow in his demeanor at the end. Without giving away the details, there is no way this is in the top 100 films on IMDB, but it is a good film. It's no Citizen Kane, though.

The obvious comparison for this movie is ""Fight Club,"" another Fincher effort. Fincher is much more successful in ""Fight Club,"" though, especially on the ending, which felt not only natural, but left you with closure (unlike in ""Se7en,"" where you are definitely left feeling that there was another half hour of unfinished business, or the ending should have been different). I loved fight club, but ""Se7en"" I would not go and see again. Just flat out not nearly as good a movie.",9
26 February 2021,10/10,"A film about the desperate search of two homicide detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) for a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the ignorance of the world of the Seven Deadly Sins. The film takes us from tortured remains from one victim to another while sociopath ""John Doe"" (Kevin Spacey) lectures Detectives Somerset and Mills - one sin at a time. The sin of gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible ability is demonstrated graphically in the dark and soft tones characteristic of the film noir. The seasoned and cultured but tired Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi, while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at his efforts to get into the mind of an assassin.

19 November 2006,Se7en's distinctive dark style and killer premise make it worthwhile despite some glaring problems.,"Se7en is so interesting in a number of ways and for a number of reasons. The first is simply that murder stories have an interesting, visceral appeal which Se7en is able to put to use. To compound the powerful drawing force of murder mysteries, Se7en has easily one of the most interesting concepts in the history of murder mysteries, as the killer bases his murders on Dante's Seven Deadly Sins. Each new murder proves to be an interesting twist, since new details about the case as a whole are revealed, and since there's no telling in what gruesome fashion the murder will have been carried out. Indeed, the murders of Se7en are symbolic yet extremely grisly, meaning that the movie will both capture your attention and take a part of it for good.

The movie is also given excellent performances by Morgan Freeman and Kevin Costner. In the type of performance that by now seemed attuned to his abilities, Freeman plays a muted, wizened character who has seen his share of crap in the world. Costner also gives an excellent performance, both in how he plays quieter parts well, and how he fills the shoes of a serial killer perfectly. The best villains are the ones who truly believe they are doing the right thing. Easily the most chilling scene of the movie is the scene where Costner explains his side of the story. As Freeman's character describes, the killings are his ""sermons"" to the world, his teachings to a world with a skewed perception of morality.

""Fight Club"" director David Fincher brings his gritty, dark sense of style to Se7en by filling the spaces with shadows and quiet, creepy music. It becomes clear almost immediately that this unnamed city is a place to hate--a dirty place full of prostitutes, beggars, and psychos, a city that shares none of the glamour of the darkened ""Sin City."" As the movie progresses, more and more you get the feeling that it's getting darker, and that everything is spiraling out of control.

That said, the movie has several very distinct weaknesses which easily make it harder to watch, and harder to enjoy in principle. The gaping hole in Se7en is named Brad Pitt--while clearly his character is meant as Freeman's foil--an impatient, aggressive rookie--he ends up being frustrating and obnoxious throughout the movie. There is an immediate attraction to Freeman's character, and so with the introduction and development of Pitt's character, Mills, you end up liking him less and less. The vast majority of the profanity is used by Pitt, and it is not used in an effective manner at all. Furthermore, Mills does not have one interesting bone in his body, and Pitt's acting skills are MIA for the duration. Pitt is obviously more attuned to unique roles, such as Tyler Durden, and not roles requiring a typical type of acting.

The ending, while interesting and definitely worthwhile in concept--and on the script--is dumbed down quite a bit by the anti-climatic pacing and Pitt's aforementioned shortcomings. But when you can ignore Pitt as much as possible, and when Spacey's character is introduced, Se7en proves itself to be one of the most interesting concepts in a long time that is, for the most part, cashed in on.",8
29 May 2021,Disappointing,"I held back from watching this movie for a while, I thought it was gonna be a good watch and so I kept it last on my list.

Why did I find it disappointing, you might wonder? Well, I saw the ending coming a mile away, and don't get me wrong, I don't judge a movie by it's ending but this one was building up to it. Also there was a lot of time spent on meaningless things and not enough on the actual main investigation which felt a bit rushed, or at least that's how I saw it.

On the good side, the acting was great (I mean what were you expecting when you have Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman in the main roles). I also liked how they stuck with the dark scenery and the constant rain.

In my book, Se7en gets a 7.",7
5 June 2002,Great!,"Se7en is a very brutal & graphic movie. Just watching Brad Pitt shoot Kevin Spacey about 7 times in the head is worth your $5. This movie is not for anyone for the weak at heart. I usually don't like Brad Pitt movies. But, Se7en is an exception. Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt make a great team. And co-starring the lovely Gweneth Paltrow. You can't lose!!! It is a great movie. It has alot of twists & turns so be ready!

However, I tried as hard as I could to go in knowing as little about it as I possibly could, and all I knew was that it was about the Seven sins. Even still, I couldn't help but find myself one step ahead of the plot on many occasions. Perhaps I have seen too many of these sorts of films, but apart from that, more than decent.

11 March 2019,Se7en Review,"I can't believe that I hadn't seen one before, and I'm glad that I did managed to see it. Se7en is often considered to be one of the finest examples of modern crime thrillers and has established David Fincher as one of the finest directors in Hollywood.

Set within the course of seven days, it follows two homicide detectives who are on the hunt for a serial killer that based his crimes on the seven deadly sins. As the plot unfolds, a friction arises between the two detectives and how they go about their work as they both race against time to prevent the killer from succeeding his sadistic work.

Easily Fincher's darkest film to date, this movie is dripping with an unsettling atmosphere. Right from the opening scene, it lets you know exactly what kind of world we're entering; the lighting, the bleak shadows, the deterioration of the crime-ridden city, the constant rainfall that happens during exterior shots; all of these make the setting feel unsettling and gives the viewers a sense of dread that builds up all the way to the end. The story and the screenplay is masterfully crafted and the slightest details all play a part in the overall narrative.

The cast delivers a great performance; Morgan Freeman is very likable as Somerset, an aging detective who has been through hell and is ready to retire and live a peaceful life, but finds that he keeps getting drawn into all the chaos that's happening. Brad Pitt is also good as Mills, a young detective who, while determined to find the killer, he's overly ambitious and is completely naive to the whole situation. Their chemistry is what also makes them great; Mills is cocky and impulsive, while Somerset is calm and self-controlled, and both men try to work off each other.

However, the character who steals the show is the serial killer ""John Doe"" himself. As soon as he reveals himself to the audience, you can tell he's dripping with dread and evil accompanying him and how he manages to orchestrate his evil plans, all in which builds up to one hell of an intense finale that I refuse to spoil here, but I will say it will make your skin crawl long after you see it.

Overall, Se7en still remains as one of the definitive examples of the exploration of the mind of a serial killer and how he manages to do it instead of why he did it, made possible by Fincher's gritty vision that doesn't sugarcoat it. This dark, relentless, and original tale still remains effective now as it was in 1995. One of Fincher's best works; highly recommend it.

Final Verdict: 10/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness.",10

9 November 2003,By Far The Best Serial Killer Movie,"So many crappy killer flicks show the killer throughout the film. Seven is told entirely from to point of view of the detectives. And there's no stupid ending where the killer is revealed to have been one of characters the whole time. Deranged killers do not live among us in society. They are severely disturbed individuals who distance themselves from the public. Seven accurately portrays this type of character. The cinematography is beautiful and the chase scene is really cool. Morgan Freeman is great as usual and Brad Pitt is hilarious as, what I think, the comic relief. Seven should be regarded as a classic crime drama.

3 December 2005,Escalating horrors for the sake of escalating horrors,"I found the film dreary. Slow paced between the action scenes, and the action usually pretty prosaic...though well-shot The usual flotillas of cop cars on the chase, the gun pursuits through city slums etc. Morgan Freeman had a glum life, downer life-style, but was too little of his life and charm was revealed to make us care. Brad Pitt was brash, and affectionate. Kevin Spacey was Kevin Spaceyily good. The murders seemed set-pieces of gruesomeness..unmoving - aside from the last - because there was no sense of the humanity of the victims. Good gruesomeness is possible - e.g The Silence of the Lambs, a brilliantly characterized film.

10 November 2004,Se7en: Revisited,"Well I finally saw Se7en for the first real time last night. Don't get me wrong - of course I saw the seminal serial-killer flick when it originally came out in '95, albeit when it first hit videostores. At that time, for some reason unknown to me today, I simply didn't care for it. It didn't hook my attention, and something about the directorial style jarred me rather than impressed. Well that all changed - dramatically - last night when I sat home alone and watched it very carefully on DVD. Some of you already know that David Fincher is one of my very favorite directors, mainly because of FIGHT CLUB, but also for his other mindtrick movies such as THE GAME, and even ALIENS III to an extent - a movie I feel deserves more appeal than it seems to receive. PANIC ROOM was a bit of a disappointment to me arriving on the heels of the senses-shattering Fight Club, but there was no mistaking the genius that went into its craftmanship. Now back to Se7en, and its stunning, brutal beauty. There is no room in my mind left for doubt that ""Jonathan Doe"" wins the blue ribbon prize for most brilliant serial killer ever captured in a movie, and the now familiar actor who portrays him delivers what I feel must remain as his most chilling screen role to date. Whatever it was I ""didn't get"" about Se7en nine years ago, I can only try and imagine; but I needn't bother now that I've fully digested this tightly focused morality tale about the sins of modern man which we all take for granted throughout our daily lives. Morgan Freeman delivers such a solid and outstanding performance as Detective William Somerset, that he helps rise this film above the normal gamut of such typical police procedural fare, and into the realm of art. His character provides the much needed humanity that is the focus of the movie's themes. Brad Pitt portrays the cocky Detective Mills in his usual easy going, fluent style that makes him such a box office success. The movie is an outstanding depiction of all the baroque details that make up a squalid life in a rundown section of New York city, itself symbolic as the diseased heart of a country passing into sociological ruin and decay. To not recognize Se7en as a true masterpiece of film-making is to have committed one of the deadly sins of movie-going: not paying enough attention. Because that is what I was guilty of - not once, but twice did I see this movie on video during the past decade, and I was obviously not engaged to the point of committing myself to the inherent dynamics going on in the film. All I can say today after having this stark and disturbing psychological thriller drilled into my mind for the third time, is that I have learned what not paying close attention to the works of David Fincher can result in: simply missing out on what could be considered one of the most talented and brilliant film auters of our generation. They say hindsight is 20-20, and in this case that certainly turned out to be true, as I now consider Se7en to rival Fight Club as contendor for not only Fincher's best movie thus far, but most certainly exceeding Silence Of The Lambs (in my mind) to claim the prize as the #1 Best serial-killer movie ever lensed.

The movie is a triumph of thematic values that far exceeds the ambitions of Silence Of The Lambs. In Silence, there was not much beyond the tightly controlled unspooling of the plot, and of course there was the dynamic and chilling performance from Sir Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lector: his character was that film's dark heart. But to compare the two films beyond their ""serial killer cores"" would be a mistake; they are truly two different enterprises altogether. In Se7en, we have the decaying city itself as the heart of what is unfolding around all the characters; it is as if they all dwell within its sickened superstructure, in a sort of grim resolve to continue on until it reaches its final, shuddering spasm & ceases beating altogether. And within this structure haunted by ceaseless violence and hopelessness, humans dwell in their daily struggles to get on with their lives, or even try and devote their lives to doing something about it, as in the case of Pitt's detective Mills. Meanwhile, there are those who have already spent their lives in futility against the ever looming, oceanic tide of sin, filth, and murder that has been washing in daily since as long as they can remember, as in the case of Freeman's detective Somerset, who is intent on retiring so he can escape to the countryside and enjoy some peace, clear air, and tranquility. And caught in between these 2 polarities is the killer, ""John Doe"", as expressionistic & sadistic a killer as we are ever likely to meet on screen, yet imbued with an underlying philosophical outlook that nearly demands the unsettled viewer's sympathetic understanding even in the face of his indisputably loathsome acts. The arc these 3 characters represent serves to ennervate the inner wire of that naked 40-watt bulb which weakly flickers on to reveal what is lying in wait inside the darkness enveloping the cellar under everyone's prettied-up homes: that we are grouped together in a darkening basement under the sky, subject to the mass-induced and traumatizing influence of apathy, greed and sloth engendered by the mob mentality of society itself. In Se7en's unrelentingly grim vision, no one escapes this evergrowing cancerous shadow on the face of humanity; not the serial killer ""John Doe"", who despite all his efforts to ""prove"" something to his fellows by his heinous deeds is doomed to be swallowed up by history as merely one of it's slightly darker footnotes; certainly not detective Mills who is ultimately victimized where it matters most, beyond hope and redemption; and in the final analysis, not even the well-meaning and morally focused detective Somerset, who in the end must face the traumatizing truth that no matter where he may choose to escape from the city and end out his days, he will never be able to escape the memories that made up his bruised and shattered life. Se7en is, in short, a triumph of artistic film-making on every level, and in this moviegoer's eyes, deserves as many stars as your rating system offers. A true classic in the psychological thriller genre.",
21 July 2008,Disturbing with a Loaded Cast,"The seven deadly sins are the subject of David Fincher's enormously popular and cult hit Se7en. On a side note, I'm not sure how a 7 looks like the letter V but we digress, I suppose. Moving on, this film is both terrifying and tragic, and offers a wonderful detective story with two great performances. Morgan Freeman plays Detective William Somerset, a patient and by-the-book officer, who makes decisions with care but is not afraid to act instinctively. Brad Pitt plays Detective David Mills, the antithesis to Freeman's deductive Somerset. Mills is rash and often acts impulsively. The interaction between these two characters develops along with the twisting plot of the film, centering upon murders based upon the seven cardinal sins.

The film is at its core a detective story with two very different men trying to work with each other to find a serial killer. Like a Silence of the Lambs, this film uses its characters to develop the plot since it is the inherent weaknesses of each victim that the murderer bases his kills upon. Like the detectives, we similarly uncover each murder and sin, each becoming more grisly than the former. The film does force us to think a little and make heads and tails of the whole situation. Do we feel sympathy for these victims who are extreme embodiments of each respective sin? It's questions like these that make Se7en such a thought provoker. It is disturbing and relentless, barely giving a breather to the viewer. Either the two are discovering a murder or they are fervently trying to connect the dots. The suspense is great and helps the film nicely overall.

The performances turned in by the cast are for the most part, well done. Freeman plays a little too close to the chest but even so, he does a good job portraying an intelligent and conservative detective. Pitt does an outstanding job and gets stronger and stronger as the film progresses. He really is an officer that I loved to hate so bravo on a job well done. On the other hand, Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as Mills' wife, Tracy, is boring and heavy-handed. Both a symptom of the writing and Paltrow's mediocre acting, Tracy ends up being a character hard to sympathize with or even feel good for. This does ultimately end up hurting the film towards the end and it's a shame too. There are some surprises and twists here so I won't spoil them but do be wary.

While the screen writing and characters are fairly strong, the cinematography is all over the place. The murder scenes are haunting and baleful, and add a great layer to the film without being gratuitously grotesque. However, in other parts, the camera work is not up to par and the film suffers. The whole ending sequence is mishandled by the camera crew and ends up ruining the whole mystique. The score is powerful when it needs to be and subtle when it needs to be. In any case, it is not tremendously memorable but it does give atmosphere to certain scenes. Some of the dialogue is memorable especially the closing lines of the film, which help the film finish well.

Overall, Se7en, (still don't get the 7 in the middle) is a good strong film that will disturb and is likely not for the faint of heart. There are strong performances, unsettling sequences and an overall moody score that does bolster the visuals. However, a sloppy ending, some unfulfilled promise from an all-star cast, and some suspect camera work at times, keep this film from truly being great. Definitely a film worth checking out though and one that tells a good story with good characters.",8
8 May 2009,Iconic,"You have to start with the key thing. This movie has one of the most stupendous endings you're ever going to see. Thrilling, revolting, excruciating. You can put yourself in the place of any of Pitt, Freeman or Spacey and it just has to play out this way. The unbelievable tension is created in a seemingly static situation. Spacey and Freeman watch Pitt. Pitt knows he's being gamed, knows what he must not do, for everyone's sake, and yet, the provocation! Who could not respond to that provocation? When I feel myself doing the stupid, irrational thing, I often think of this movie. Maybe this is the layman's example of temporary insanity, when a totally understandable emotional force overwhelms one's intellect.

Wonderfully acted of course by Freeman and Spacey and Pitt. In my opinion, pretty much the only Brad Pitt movie I would say that about, maybe save Thelma and Louise. Spacey's psychotic intellect suggests the more famous Dr. Lecter, though Spacey doesn't have as much time or cards to play in his end-of-movie role.",9
2 March 1999,Symbolism,"This movie scared me more than any other film I have seen. The performances were great. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt worked well together. Spacey was eerie and haunting as the killer. In fact the only person who didn't work good in the film was Gwyneth Paltrow (as much as I like her). Fincher's direction was great. Especially how he used rain on the first six days and a sunny desert on the last.

14 July 1999,A Reminder,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10
28 March 2020,Best thriller ever made!,"Wow. A movie that actually cares and Exceeds at about plot, characters, twist, thrill, and captivation. I am very impressed!

12 May 2020,One of David Finchers best.,"Seven, also known as SE7EN, is a 1995 American crime thriller directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey. Seven tells the story of David Mills (Pitt), a detective who partners with the retiring William Somerset (Freeman) to track down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a motif in his murders. Seven grossed $327.3 million and currently holds a certified fresh score of 81% on Rotten Tomato's and 8.6/10 on IMDb. However, audiences enjoyed the film a lot more than critics with a 95% audience score on Rotten Tomato's, I am definitely one of those people that love this film as it engaged and intrigued me.

Its hard to think of many directors that have been as consistently good as David Fincher has been over the years, with the exception of Alien 3, he's had hits such as Zodiac, The Social Network, Fight Club and Gone Girl which have all proven to be incredibly successful and beautiful to watch. Seven was David Finchers first great successes that, like his other movies, has continued to gain popularity throughout the years. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are brilliantly casted as the new up and coming detective and older detective nearing the end of his time respectively and have great chemistry together, the supporting cast is no less impressive as they all work greatly in contributing to the story. Having directed both Seven and Zodiac, David Finchers is the man to go to if you want intelligent and shocking crime thrillers.

The theme of the seven deadly sins aspect of the film is a unique and interesting original approach, as it brings grim and unsettling murder scenes that interest and draws in the audience as well as repulses them with the brutal imagery and techniques that are used for each murder. With each murder also comes interesting investigating scenes that leave your heart racing at it brings itself to that ultimate heart-wrenching conclusion. Kevin Spacey's John Doe is a daunting and intimidating screen presence every time he's on screen which makes for interesting and unsettling viewing for the audience.

Se7en is a psychological fabrication of thematic scope and suspenseful sequences that payed off in the mid 90s and is still revered as one of Fincher's best to this day. The dark atmosphere and unforgettable sense of mystery makes Seven a film that is still loved by the masses today.",9
10 September 2019,One of the best films in 90's.,"Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman... This trio is so strong at acting. This film has the one of the best stories I have ever watched. Especially the unexpected ending is blowing your mind. Brilliant usage of camera angles and awesome directing thank you, David Fincher, for this masterpiece. You can see the awesome directing skills in the every scene of this film. Soundtracks, scenario all of the important parts of the great film are there. Watch this and let the other ones know about it.

1 November 2021,Vintage Thriller,"I tend to believe that the golden era of movies was the 90's and I have no doubt that this was of the greatest at that time. Each of the trio leading actors had one of their best performances in the film. The plot left me speechless and held my breaths to the very end. It is a true example of how mystery movies can be made in a balanced way where the odds go back and forth between the protagonists and antagonist. I think the weakest link of this masterpiece was in the few first scenes. Those watching without prior hints may find it a little bit boring with the story moving in a slow pace in the beginning and the plot left unexplained for a while.

2 December 2002,Not for the faint of heart.,"Yet this ultimate morality play, is also one of the best horror movies ever filmed. Filled with acts so vile so horrible, yet done with such purpose we will ponder the killers acts and poetic explanation of said acts for years to come. A social commentary on a civilization that looks the other way when confronted by cruelty beyond comprehension. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are a perfect pair of opposites attracting in order to save the world from a souless monster who leads them on a cat and mouse chase of his own choosing. One of my favorite movies of all time.

TheDavid Fincher's talent and recognition do not require unnecessary mentions, and it is this knowledge and understanding that form a permanent desire to see his creation. Impressive and fascinating, his ability to screen really complex themes and line-by-line ideas evokes his own stormy applause. The film ""Seven"" suggests reasoning, a clear understanding of well-known dogmas for oneself, comparing hidden ideas of whatever it is with the concept put forward, with a universal understanding, recognition or condemnation of what frames our life.

One can talk a lot about the seven deadly sins, but it is difficult to classify all the sins of humanity and sort them into seven shelves, understanding the relationship of what generates this or that, it is the essence of these relationships. The concept itself is not part of Christian teaching, such a classification is only an attempt to sort out the sinfulness of man and humanity. How to present and, most importantly, ""lose"" such dogmas of the creed, without directing the thread into excessive religiosity and philosophicness of the film, without ""specific intrasense morality"" and parting words, with the absence of so-called violence against thinking and demonstration of controversial undisclosed false ideas. The implementation of this concept in the thriller genre requires certain praise, and, getting to the most important thing, undoubtedly the highest praise. To show a terrible sinner who considers himself God and has the right to administer God's judgment, imagining himself a kind of philanthropist - when interacting not with victims, but with detectives conducting investigations and cutting out intricacies around them - all such actions contribute to a pathetic viewer to see how a great idea and a great scenario is subject to remove all kinds of cliches and demonstrate a movie of big ideas, which David Fincher is not devoid of addictions to shoot.

The cynicism that permeated the entire entourage, exposing it in the most gloomy form, with the predominance of bad, 'crying' weather, demonstrations of the most intimate things related to corpses, revealing fetid ulcers of humanity - all this reaches a kind of apogee and brings the film to the highest level, to such a level of inaccessibility, leaving countless attempts to portray something similar. The film shows all the insignificant human religiosity on a global scale, shows seemingly well-known dogmas that can play a role in the perspective of their own hypotheses. All you need to have a priori before viewing is the knowledge that the entire intellectual message, without the slightest bit of understatement and undisclosure, is involved in 120 minutes of unsurpassed staging, which leave the viewer in the gloomy abyss of their own questions and answers.

21 May 2006,Se7en,"Morgan Freeman makes this movie a standout. What a classy guy. A great movie, well written and it shows in this movie. I plan on buying this on a CD so I can listen to the book and see if it follows the movie. When I first saw this movie, I was prepared to just see another crime/mystery, but as you get into the movie, you see it is more than that. Morgan does his best to not like his new young partner. He also wanted this new, young partner to know he could not count on him being around for long as he was getting ready to retire and just wanted his days to be nice and quiet. The new partner did teach Morgan that young, upcoming detectives can and does become a very good cover your butt type of detective. I especially liked the part about Brad's wife making a point of meeting Morgan, she went out of her way to do that.

3 January 1999,Dark and glorious.,"I think this is a fabulous film, a sort of gothic fairytale for the end of the 20th century.

In a way, this shows what Alien 3 could have been, if Fox had had the courage to let Fincher have his way. It looks wonderful, the city is an evil presence in itself, and is intelligently scripted and acted. What impresses me most, however, is that the film has the courage of its convictions.

It's horribly logical; we know how it's going to end, but we don't want things to turn out that way. The film, unusually for mainstream Hollywood product, doesn't cop out and give us a happy ending - it gives us the ending it has to have.

2 November 2004,pierced navel gazing,"i just posted this as a reply on the boards, but thought i might post it here as well:

when this came out theatrically, i had the choice between se7en and copycat as current procedural crime thrillers-- i chose se7en, and once i had finally seen copycat on cable, regretted my choice-- don't everybody yell at me at once, please take turns!

the thing about se7en which got me into the movie house was its potential for needing the big screen in order to be appreciated-- its art direction quotient-- on that score, i probably made the right choice, but the dramatic effect of the film was depressing and desensitizing, so much so, that by the end i didn't care who lived or died. on the other hand, copycat had interesting well-fleshed out characters and a fundamental understanding of good story craft; it is infinitely re-watchable for these reasons.

looking back on se7en, i have fuzzy memories of bad brad pitt acting in an over-long nine inch nails video, nothing more.

10 June 1999,a masterpiece!,"This film was brilliant and an extraordinary piece of work! HOWEVER, don't see it if you need a movie with a happy ending. You've probably been told this before, so if you don't like being depressed, don't see it. I'm tired of seeing people complain that it was too dark. That was the filmmaker's intention! The dialogue is some of the best ever written. Don't see this film alone.

1 January 2000,Creeping terrific thriller with a fabulous Freeman,"This is the surprise thriller of 1995. They hardly ever comes any better than this. Great story, terrific acting (Especially Morgan Freeman), faultless direction. It's way more uncomfortable than movies that tries to shock you with blood and gore. In this one we witness the effects of what has already happened. We are not there at the killings (thank God!). This way it slowly creeps up on you to a much better effect than any visual violence can achieve. But it has a giveaway that keeps it from not being a 10. Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Brad Pitt's wife, isn't in the film very much. she only pops up four or five times in the movie. The scenes are also quite short. What usually happens with wives, girlfriends, sisters and son on who doesn't appear much in the usual Hollywood-movie? Right! They die. So does Gwyneth. The only thing that differs from most films, is the way it's done. So what could have been a full 10 only becomes a 9 because of the formula treatment of the cops wife. But besides that; Terrific!!

1 April 1999,Come join the Dark Side,"This is one of the more memorable films I ever saw. I have seen it four times by now, but it still draws me completely into the story every time.

All along you hope together with Bratt Pitts' character that there is a basic sense of goodness in humanity and that it is worth fighting for, but deep down you know that Morgan Freeman's character has seen it all and lost hope. The more the film proceeds the more you realize that most people in the film don't care about good or bad anymore, and the way the murders are committed really make you feel sick (note: there isn't much to see, but your imagination can fill in far to many missing details).

Towards the end there are some amazing twists that turn the story from a nicely resolved murder case into a very tense finale that makes you feel completely drained.

Brilliant!",10
24 December 1999,"A Brave, Bold and Genuine Thriller","Other reviews discuss the plot of this thriller. In this review, I only wish to highlight that Seven is vastly superior to most serial killer movies and is worthy of Alfred Hitchcock. David Fincher gets convincing performances out of all his players (even Brad Pitt). The film drips with dark atmosphere and claustrophobia. This film will be remembered long after most films of the 90s (and 80s) are fading memories. A throwback to American cinema's courageous years - the early 1970s. See this movie.

28 June 2000,The movie that made me fall in love with Kevin Spacey,"This is by far one of the best movies ever made. If nothing else, see it for Kevin Spacey's brief role. The car scene with Spacey, Pitt and Freeman is one of the best written scenes I've ever had the pleasure to see. And as far as I'm concerned, a lot of people really over exaggerate how violent this movie is. Or maybe I'm just completely desensitized to this kind of thing. Only thing that really bothered me about this movie was the Sloth guy. That was pretty nasty.

See it.

18 April 2002,Very disappointing (some spoilers),"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt).

26 July 2001,Serial Killer movie done right!,"It is a rare studio film (at least in 1995, when Seven was released) that has the cojones to be this dark, sinister, and depressing. Yet, despite the dark tones and cynical view of the world, the film is totally mesmerizing. Great performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Also, a completely chilling, albeit brief, portrayal of the killer by a now-famous uncredited actor.

My only gripe about the film is that it is a bit overstylized by Fincher. Honestly, it can't be dark and rainy 24 hours a day. But, for the most part, the style benefits the film. Still, you may find yourself wishing someone in the film would flip on a light switch every now and then.

The way the movie builds up is nervewracking. In the beginning, you find out that a killer is using the Seven Deadly Sins as his M.O. You learn what these sins are, and then you begin to wonder what will happen next. How will the next person be killed? With each graphic and disturbing death, there is a greater sense of horror and disbelief. The murders sound outlandish, but the realism of the film keeps each killing resting uncomfortably in the back of your mind. Also, unlike most Hollywood thrillers, you never actually see the murders happen, but see enough images that you can imagine each brutal scene. I think that adds to the dramatic value of the crime scenes. It is definately worth noting that this film is not for the squeamish.

The first time I saw Seven, the ending absolutely blew me away. Some may argue that it is predictable, but I think Fincher merely gives enough information to make you suspect that the ending may occur. He then builds up the tension until you are dying to have your suspicions confirmed. The first time I watched it, I truly couldn't believe what I had just seen. Almost like I wanted to believe it didn't happen. It is as powerful and memorable of an ending as I have ever seen.

Many imitators have tried to use a similar formula, but then put in some cheap, Hollywood ending that ruins the film (ie, The Bone Collector). If you want to see a serial killer movie done right, watch Seven.",
25 April 2021,disappointing climax,"Great film....but the climax in film is not satisfactory....great performances from all cast.

14 September 2001,"quite simply the greatest thriller EVER, if you've got the stomach for it","Thrillers are my favorite type of movies, and this is my favorite thriller, so basically this is more or less my favorite movie of all-time!!!! Brad Pitt has become an awesome actor, not content to rest on his prettyboy image, and you just can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman. To top it off, you have Gwyneth Paltrow posing as Pitt's wife, and a cameo by one of my favorite actors, who I sadly cannot reveal. Se7en is the story of two detectives (Pitt & Freeman), trying to catch a patient and determined killer. John Doe (played by someone whom I cannot name), bases his murders upon the writings of Dante and his idea of seven deadly sins; gluttony, greed, pride, sloth, lust, envy and wrath. The detectives must catch Doe before he completes the 7 murders and disappears from the public eye. What can be said about this movie, other than ""SEE IT""? It is dark, it doesn't pull any punches and unlike most movies it stays true to itself right through to the end credits. Many movies for box-office success will sugar-coat their endings at the expense of the story. That is not the case here. Here, they go the whole nine yards and it pays off in every way. Pitt and Freeman are great opposite one another. While Pitt is youthful and energetic, throwing caution to the wind, Freeman is experienced, calculated and thoughtful with each move. They have a strong screen chemistry that only heightens the payoff in the final scene. Gwyneth Paltrow, while not carrying a lot of screen time, rings true in each scene she appears in. She is not only beautiful, but has a presence that is very strong opposite greats like Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Se7en has set a new standard for movie thrillers. It is not filled with camera tricks or long chase scenes down dark alleys (although there is one. It relies upon an intelligent story and fantastic performances. It is a classic for fans of this genre for all-time.",10

21 January 2007,"Why it is a ""must see"" :)","This is one off the films that reflected a new way off looking to crime scene films.

The argument is surprising and the development is most unexpected, if you like films that require some intellectual logic, this is the one.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman demonstrate how good is there work as actors on giving a very real sense to the characters.

Enjoy and try not to find more about the argument, let it bee surprising... it surely is one off the best outcomes in this type off films.

Therefore it's on my list off the very bets ever.

10 February 2023,Hight rate with reason,"I loove David's movies because of greasy walls that add so much to the atmosphere, especially in scenes where they are visiting the crime scenes and everything is.illuminated just by the light of torches. Not only that it looks good but it adds so much suspense to the moment.

The whole rhythm of the movie and the editing is so good, giving us just enough clues in just right time in the movie. I love the fact that we don't even have any suspects at any point till the moment we find out who he is and we are sure that it's him. But even that we don't suspect anyone to be a killer, everything is so intense the whole time.

I also love the relationship between detectives. Two completely different temperaments, two types of thinking of solving the case and two completely different stages of experience and they have to tolerate the other's behavior even though tho they do not understand it.

In conclusion loved it and it's one of the best movies i've ever seen. Would highly HUGHLY recommend.

Fun fact: if you watch closely in the scene where they are chasing the killer, when he shoots out of gun the pigeons are not moving, but that is the movie just for a second and doesn't really matter but i taught it was fun to share.",10

15 April 2003,Simply stunning. No film comes close. Unbeatable,"Seven is quite simply the greatest film ever made. The nearest rivals are Pulp Fiction and Aliens but when it comes to creating unbelievable tension and suspense there is nothing to rival it. David Fincher ingeniously creates a dark and shocking world of horror and death that sends shivers down your spine every time you watch it. All the cast excel and are in career best form, from Morgan Freeman's composed and reflective Somerset to the magnificent and sinister cameo from Kevin Spacey in the film's gripping climax. It may not be for the faint-hearted but is a genuine must-see that leaves all competition for top spot trailing hopelessly in it's wake.

3 January 2012,"One of cinema's best crime thrillers, from the great David Fincher.","David Fincher is a genius. I love this film, and some people might be turned off by its violent nature, but it really is an amazing crime thriller. A murder mystery tale at its finest.

The cast is superb. Morgan Freeman portrays Detective William Somerset, an experienced crime-solver who has been on the force for many years. He plans on retiring soon, & grows tired of the city's horrors. Freeman excels as a character burdened by the city's dark and twisted web of crime. He just wants to get out. Brad Pitt is also very good as newly transferred Detective David Mills. He's short-tempered and impatient, almost the complete opposite of the elderly Somerset. People don't give Pitt enough credit, in my opinion. He's a fine actor & often overlooked (though he is getting the attention he deserves nowadays).

The supporting cast is also excellent, with Gwyneth Paltrow playing Mill's wife. She is having trouble adjusting to the dark cityscape in which they now inhabit, and fears that something terrible might happen to her in the oppressive place.

The plot is fairly simple. A sadistic murderer has been going around killing in a way that relates to the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, & Wrath. It's very nasty business. Together, Somerset and Mills attempt to solve the murders. What follows is a dark & complex tale as the detectives race to find the murderer.

The cinematography in this film is excellent, it's dark and mesmerizing. The city is literally crumbling, and the look is achieved perfectly. The directors & writers really did good work on this, and there is some real emotional weight to the film. The villain is excellent as well (& I'm not going to spoil who he is played by, even though most people have seen this movie by now).

& then ending! What a shocker. Bottom Line; If you haven't seen this, watch it! I'm surprised I'm so dang late on this.",9

23 December 2022,One the best movie endings ever written and directed.,"I remember watching Seven back in 95, first day of release. The place was full (around 500 people, a cinema/theater) and it was the first time in my life I've seen 500 people leaving the cinema shocked, without talking. Yes, I can talk about the Gotham-like constant rain, the decaying buildings, the sound of the sirens from police cars in the background subtly serving you a city that's full of death and crime, the sick yellow color Fincher chose for some of the most important scenes, the incredible performances, the fact that ****** (wont spoil it although you probably already know) asked for his name to not be included in the intro credits for shocking reasons, the fitting and unsettling score and many many more that made Seven my favorite movie of all time BUT I'm gonna point out just one thing and finish the review. The reason that I can watch this movie every now and then again without feeling bored or need to skip scenes. The third Act and especially the last 20 minutes are some of the most shocking, dark, nihilistic and intense minutes ever directed. Don't let yourself get spoiled, just go and watch this brilliant movie, you wont regret a single minute of it. Thank you David Fincher, thank you for Seven and Fight Club, from the bottom of my heart.",10

8 April 2021,Movie to add to your list,"Seven is probably the most majestic work of a crystalline talent like David Fincher. A film where the world mirrors the feelings of the characters. A city fallen into despair, where evil reigns supreme. Put in this context a policeman tired of the fight against crime, an enterprising young man who believes in justice and a pure woman. Will evil or good win?

31 January 2020,Disturbingly compelling,"This film is quite an experience. David Fincher creates such an unsettling atmosphere in practically every scene, it's unsettling to watch. Even back then, the Trent Reznor connection was there, setting the mood right at the start behind a disturbing opening sequence. It's starkly evident that Fincher simply didn't hold back, he had a vision of how this film would look and just went for it. The way the plot slowly unfolds is just pure genius, daring the audience to try to figure out what's going on. There's also the excellent dynamic of the two main characters, who are well played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, but even better written. Very few films pack such a punch on their first viewing

12 February 1999,Lowers opinions on the human race.,"Se7en effected me in a big way. It made me see that the people I look up to and admire are far from perfect and the human race is a quite disgusting breed of animal. There are so many issues in this movie, complex and truly frightening. A lot of the violence in the film goes unseen apart from split second shots of the victims, this improves suspense and the realism in this movie is amazing. Kevin Spacey is rapidly becoming my favourite actor and he plays as an unerringly vacant, incredibly intelligent man. They're always the quiet ones so they say, and that's what scares me the most.

In his eyes, the rule of his conduct was to punish evil and make good, and because the murderer had committed seven crimes, he acted in god's behalf. Of good and evil border upon du John is no longer so clear, this is an extremely complex inner character, David fincher through such a character, completely obscures the world clear judgment of good and evil, a desire to purdue beings, encouraging people to people ended up using the means of extreme intolerance,traditional morality under the lens of David fincher gradually lost the criterion.

4 March 2021,WOW!,"Se7en is an amazing film and creped it's way up to being one of my favourite movies. brad pitt and morgan freeman do an incredible job playing their characters and i really like the dynamic that they bring to the screen. David finchers work is a masterpiece.

the reason why this film is loved by me and many others is not just the acting, the mystery, the meaning etc but that ending. wow! also i would like to mention that kevin spacey does a very good job as well, his character is so creepy and disturbing yet so calm and sensible - in a way. spaceys acting makes you feel that john doe had a point when killing these 'innocent' people and that's what's so creepy and unnerving!

i really like the idea of this film (the seven deadly sins) as it brings such a mysterious and somewhat disturbing vibe to this movie which is what makes it so good. david fincher always comes through with the original ideas.

another aspect i love about this film is how it never shows the act happening, just the aftermath of it and i think that's what makes it so creepy as it lets the viewer interpret each scene however they like. it's a movie that most of the time has you at the edge of your seat, feeling as nervous and on edge as the characters are.

overall this film is a masterpiece and should be watched by everyone. in my opinion, it's finchers best movie!",10
5 February 2007,Brilliant take on a worn out concept,"This movie is easily one of my all time favorites. The movie revolves around two detectives who are trying to solve a series of murders. The murders all, some way or another, revolve around the seven deadly sins. In summarizing the plot I am reminded of countless B-movie slasher movies i have seen. The Killers in those movie always choose their victims based on some sort of imperfection (Sluts, Rick Kids, Jerks, etc.), as does the killer in this movie. But this is where this movie becomes great and what sets it apart from other horror movies. The way the killer eliminates his victims is both clever and haunting, and the directer shows very little violence on screen. He leaves the viewer with blurry and far away pictures depicting what happened at the scene of the crime, leaving the viewer to conjure up their own gory images. This is an especially effective technique in this day and age, where people are often desensitized to violence and can no longer be shocked by what they see on screen. This movie is truly a modern masterpiece,with one of the best, most shocking and disturbing endings i have ever seen.

10 September 2001,Sublime mix of madness and sanity,"I've just finished watching Se7en for the first time since its cinema release, and I'm pleased to advise you seekers of truth that every 'serial killer' film produced before or since still cannot match it. I won't repeat the many superlatives that have been deservedly heaped on the film by other reviewers above/below; suffice it to say that its bleak nature, unremitting gloom and taut storytelling go to make up a sublime mix of madness and sanity. Here we have director Fincher's most satisfying work to date (and yes, that includes FIGHT CLUB!), in the form of a cinematic 'pound of flesh', cooked medium-rare, and served on an almost-stainless silver platter.

Boasting killer performances (pun intended) from all, the subject of 'theme killings' (not put to such effective use since the OTT Vincent Price 1970s classics THE ABOMINABLE DR PHIBES and THEATRE OF BLOOD) adds a finite touch to the numerous deaths involved, and lends the story a 'mythic' strength that it might not otherwise possess. By revealing only the aftermaths of the various murders in a similar fashion to that utilised in HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, Fincher stealthily avoids the 'exploitation' tag that could so easily have resulted from the presentation of such a subject. BONE COLLECTOR, COPYCAT, Freeman's subsequent KISS THE GIRLS - lower your candles in awe, gentlemen.

See it, for the love of Mike. You may love it or loathe it, but you won't be able to forget it.

As a footnote, the 2-disc special edition DVD is the one to watch, with its four separate commentaries (total viewing time - together with the film as is - ten hours!) and a whole host of extras. However, the Se7en completist may also like to hunt down the SE laserdisc boxed set. The format may be associated with the words 'elephant' and 'white' these days, yet not only are the LD's extras almost entirely different from those on the DVD, but they also feature a couple of contributions from spfx guru Rob Bottin, who is mysteriously absent from the DVD version.",
10 November 2001,boring and predictable,"I can't BELIEVE people think so highly of this garbage. It's a by-the-numbers ""thriller"" where the ""thrills"" come from waiting to see how gruesome the next killing will be. This made it boring, because there was absolutely no tension whatsoever.

And the ending was absurdly predictable. garbage film, I give it a 5/10.

1 May 2009,"""The World is a fine place..and worth fighting for.. I agree with the second part""","The general plot if you were asked to explain the film in a few seconds would be something along the lines of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are two cops on the trail of a serial killer.

At first this sounds uninteresting to film lovers who wish for something other than a basic Mel Gibson and Danny Glover romp , which from the films brief plot explanation i previously wrote could fool some into thinking that is exactly what they will receive. However, this film is as far from an uninteresting romp as can be.

I am willing to bet that there is no one who can walk away from this film and have it not stay with them for a life time. Not only is it shocking and almost hypnotic in its gripping direction, it will also make the viewer question the world and how society really works within it.

Morgan Freeman plays an old Policeman who has seen far to much of the darkness in the world, so much so, that he is starting to believe that darkness is all that remains in it. This draws him to a decision to retire and leave police work behind, bringing along his replacement Detective Brad Pitt. They do not immediately get along (but don't worry he doesn't jump off a roof with a suicide jumper to gain respect from his ageing partner) but due to their joint discovery of a body, they are forced into each others company.

They soon come to the conclusion that a serial killer is on the loose, and find that for one thing, they share enthusiasm for the job if nothing else. Freeman's character is fascinated with the Killer, and his ideas and beliefs realising that the conclusion the killer has come to in his study of the world is similar to his own, but dealt with in different ways. Pitt shares no compassion for the killer who is later discovered to be played by Kevin Spacey in a scene which is very member able to say the least.

The killings are sick and shocking and create a certain amount of unease while watching. You will dismiss the that no human being in their right mind could do such a thing, and anyone to commit such acts would be insane, but i guarantee by the end of the film you will question this.

If you want something interesting as well as fresh to fill your mind from the world of film i recommend you try this.

This film proves that David Fincher films are often fantastic, but only once sat through to the very end. I do feel with Mr Fincher that the raw substance that each of his films provide is untasted until a good hour into his films.

This is really a thought provoking, and a fantastic and yet horrifying masterpiece, but misses out on it's final two stars due to the general lazing about of the first hour.",8
24 January 2007,Se7en,"This film has everything, action, excitement, thrills, love, death, gore, you could not ask for anything more. Saw 1 comes close as the plot line twist is also amazing but for me this film has started of an era of amazing films, just as Hendrix started the amazing guitar front, Se7en has started a great time in our lives for films. An excellent peace of acting from both main characters (Freeman and Pitt). So different as to what sort of roles Brad Pitt usually takes on. A classic usual weird and strange vibe from Mr Spacey as well. The way that the pot really does make sense in its bizard way. I would not change anything in this film at all.

25 July 2023,Overatted,"I think people just remember this film for its plot twist and not it's strangly shot sciences that are off-putting everytime you rewatch it.

Why is it always raining. The film is meant to give a gritty tone and constant rain doesn't do too much. The sins themselves don't even correlate sometimes. The fact that someone died being penetrated to death is forever cheesy.

Furthermore this film got as high a rating because of its cast. If Kevin Spacey guy was that smart surely he could find a different guy to replace him as the final sin? He wasn't suicidal?

This film is good but it's meh for a thriller nowadays especially. The fact that I don't have to put anything positive tells you how good it is everyone should've seen this by now.

19 September 2009,End was not enthralling,"USP of the movie: Basic story line Worst part: Though many viewers would not concur with me, but movie ended like a damp squib. It was more like an M Night Shyamalan movie, which ends and sort of nobody knows that it ended; till you get the closing titles ;)

This movie revolves around a psychotic serial killer, who is shown inspired by Dante's (Mythological) act of punishing doers of 7 deadly sins, by using their own sins as the means of mutilation.

The whole plot was brilliant and this is one of those movies which leaves indelible memories in the viewers mind. Nothing wrong in the end though; well i myself could not think about a better ending from hindsight but candidly it gave me the feeling that end could not live up to my expectations. Though, there would be people who would strictly be of different opinion. It would have been a brilliant brilliant novel, but showing it on the screen has taken patina off.

Though, this movie certainly is worth watching. But please complete it in one sitting. I would give it 7 on 10.",7
8 August 2003,Fantastic,"I adored this movie. If you like a good movie with some exciting suspense, then this is probably the movie for you.

I am a fan of Morgan Freeman, and he is great in this movie. Gwenyth Paltrow, although in a somewhat small role, is good. And Kevin Costner as John Doe is exceptional.

The movie is a bit graphic in some spots, and can be a bit frightening if you don't handle that kind of thing well. But if you like a good thriller, then you will probably like this movie.

22 July 2010,As good as they come,"When it comes to genres being overdone in Hollywood, the Murder-Mystery is at the top of the list, and only a select few ""heavy hitters"" come to mind. The film most widely accepted as the best murder mystery is ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", which I would have to agree as well as ""Rear Window"" and a few others, but where ""Seven"" stands out in this genre compared to others is in the film's dark, innate ability to tell a gruesome murder story set in a crime addled side of New York City. The character interactions are incredibly played out as well as it's cinematography, but this film is so dark, grisly and shocking that you literally CAN'T look away from the screen for the two hours it plays out, it grabs your attention like a drill instructor at boot camp and doesn't let go until it's over. The cinematography was captured beautifully and reminded me slightly of ""The Dark Knight"". Take note though; this ISN'T your average murder mystery, at many parts it is VERY disturbing and is most definitely not for kids, but what makes it so good is the gritty unrelenting realism of crime in the big city. ""Seven"" is so well done and has so many twists and turns in it, that I constantly found myself at the mercy of the surprises. Even at the end when you expect the story to take on a lighter path and maybe show a little redemption, it gets even darker and more sinister. After Morgan Freemans' monologue at the end you get the overwhelming sense of the true realism this story has to offer over all others of it's kind. I have to say that when it comes to murder mysteries ""Seven"" is as good as they come.",10
15 March 2018,Should have been titled Fiv5 not Se7en,"Premise of the film is woven around 7 punishable sins : Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust,Envy and Wrath. People who exhibit any one of the these sins are brutally murdered one by one.Detective Somerset (Freeman) and Mill (Pitt) join the dots to catch this serial killer. Acting,cinematography,direction,background score, editing in Se7en are brilliant except the climax.Film is convincing till 5th murder but goes haywire in climax. Last two sins Envy and Wrath are not convincing. And it is also confusing that people exhibiting any of the deadly sins are murdered or killed but person exhibiting Wrath goes to jail.

19 January 2022,The acting is also very good.,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",8
4 February 2004,"Pretty good, lets say se7en out of ten","Although this is a good and very watchable movie, it does have some major flaws. There are three obvious ones: firstly, the ending, which is just so predictable. Kevin Spacey as the serial killer announces that there are still two victims to be accounted for and it comes as no surprise when it is revealed who those two people are. Secondly, Gwyneth Paltrow. I've never really rated her in any movie that I've seen and here she gives another bland performance. Thirdly, the scenes midway through the movie where Pitt, Paltrow and Freeman are getting to know each other over dinner, really drag.

OK, criticisms out of the way. The real plus points of this film are the performances of Spacey/Freeman and also the dark menacing atmosphere that is created throughout the course of the movie. Spacey is one of the best Hollywood actors around, almost in the Tom Hanks class, and here he gives a very restrained but menacing performance as the bad guy. Morgan Freeman always gives the same type of laid-back, calm, controlled performance and here it is used to great effect. This probably ranks alongside The Shawshank Redemption as his finest appearance on celluloid. Brad Pitt and (especially) Gwyneth Paltrow look a litle bit out of their depth among these two fine actors and they don't really convince.

The plot is essentially just another serial-killer-picking-ingenious-ways-to-kill-people situation, however it is refreshingly free of pointless CGI effects and has little in the way of gore, which is nice because the movie has to get by on atmosphere and dialogue, something for which Hollywood has not always tried in major films. Among the killings are a man who is forced to eat until he (almost literally) bursts and one or two others, many of which also reveal clues deliberately left by Kevin Spacey. It's an intelligent film which really would have been a 9/10 film had the major flaws which I mentioned been addressed.",
19 January 2022,Best Detective,"'Seven' is just an amazing movie. Gloomy, like Macbeth himself, and fundamental, like a painting by Bosch, with the same number of sins in the title. I wouldn't be surprised if it was this painting by a Dutch artist that served as a catalyst for the idea for the second (read first) film by David Fincher. Deconstruction of the noir genre in all its glory, eternal rain, neon signs, detective stories and, of course, a twisted plot. Now we know how deftly Fincher manages such introductory, but in the 95th, hardly anyone knew about it.

4 May 2004,The devil had the upper hand,"There are two things in Seven that set it apart from the crowd.

First, the complementary ways of thinking from two detectives with conflicting personalities. Unlike the most stories of the same genre, Detectives Somerset and Mills formed a perfect partnership not by the similarity between them (of which there was few), but by their unlike-mindedness in nearly every point of view. Learned, sophisticated, and weary of a thirty-four-year career in dealing with crimes, Somerset allowed his heart to quit before the actual date of retirement came, dragging his feet in accepting challenges, and as a consequence the real value remained of him was to give what he guessed or believed based on his time-tested concepts and instinct. Mills, as opposed to his partner, was all fresh and green and ready for action. Their thoughts crashed practically all the way down to the end, and yet it was their very difference in mind and attitude that supplemented them each with what the other lacked in their mission to find the killer.

Second, the great disparity in power between the good and evil. It was plain that John Doe, the evildoer, was far more intelligent than the two detectives combined. And throughout the entire process of his well-planned killings, Doe kept having the upper hand, making his pursuers see what he wanted them to see at what time he defined for them. There seemed no way, absolutely no way for them to conquer him, to do what he was not intended. The last scene, appalling and heart-wrenching beyond belief, showed the utter helplessness from the men trapped and the powerful ill will of the trapper ¡ª Somerset, with the feebleness in convincing even himself, called Mills to throw his gun away; Mills, suffering torture from shock, agony and rage, couldn't help but do exactly what he was set up to do; and Doe, with a triumphant smile on his face, embraced death with all coolness. What an ending! I rate this film 9 out of 10.",9
19 November 2021,10 out of 10,"Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a thriller because of that. ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting, or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere. Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive. Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police captain. The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the library scene. Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see. 10/10.",10

20 May 2006,Yeah yeah seen it all before.,"Considering the movies that are either low or completely off the top 250 list this movie ranks low (WAY) lower then a lot of the art which resides in the film world.

A #43 rating seems a bit high considering there are SVU episodes better then this film.

I found that really it was like a lot of other films done in it's murder styling (The Watcher, The bone collector and Saw) Sure the movie does has a lot of good points about how our lives as modern humans is hedonistic and wrong. What's even more wrong is putting this film higher then other great works such as

Grave of the fireflies Dancer in the dark And Princess Mononoke

I cannot believe that such a plain mediocre film has made it so high. Just shows what popularity does and how it's deciding these poles not actual greatness in a movie.

7/10 is all it's worthy for and I should knock it down a notch but it's an even figure.",7

The only possible exception would be Brian Singer's The Usual Suspects, which also made good use of Kevin Spacey. This movie captures the dismal feel of the city right down to the rain drops and the greasy diners. Thoroughly depressing, absolutely engrossing, and spellbinding from beginning to end, this is the movie. Brad Pitt cemented his status as a ""real"" actor with this movie, and Morgan Freeman keeps on giving performances of a lifetime. This is one of my favorites.

28 January 1999,It changed my life!,"Before I saw David Fincher's ""Se7en"" I liked movies. After I saw it, I started to LOVE movies. The atmosphere, the music, the acting, that gut-wrenching finale.....what a movie!!!!! The fact that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is considered a better movie by the critics than ""Se7en"" is a scandal. Kevin Spacey should have been at least nominated for his role as John Doe. Keyser Söse, my @$$. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay is also superb. So is Fincher's directing (""The Game"" kicks @$$. Can't wait for ""The Fight Club""). And Morgan Freeman. And Brad Pitt. And everyone else involved in the making of this movie. Plus, that title sequence made me consider that maybe the academy should add ""Best title sequence"" to the Academy Awards. So, if you like pure suspense, without the gore, watch ""Se7en""...again!

17 January 2000,David Fincher's best work,"What i really like from this movie is the non-conventional end. Like Morgan Freeman's character says at then end : ""Hemingway said 'World is a fine place, what is worth fighting for'. I agree with the second part"" It's a dark movie, placed in all-day-raining city. A grey city, where people has few hope. A city where people goes mad, just like John Doe, killing without an apparent reason, thinking he's doing a favor to the rest. Some people don't like the movie because they said the whole movie, and its end, it's too cruel, too crude. I don't think so. It's damn real. That's what they're afraid from, reality. They don't want see the world just like it is, cause can't bear it. Remember this: World is not a fine place, but that isn't a reason to give up.

27 April 2000,an intelligent thriller not soon forgotten,"se7en is creepy. no doubt.in the hands of others, it may have been a schlocky ""silence of the lambs"" serial killer movie, but the performances and direction are given such gravity that it really gets under your skin and is, at times almost too much too bear. it is easy to dismiss pitt's performance as average as i did (admittedly, i'm not a big fan) but watching it a third time after years between my quickly repeated first and second viewings, i found a cleverness in his character in that , as a rookie detective he is cocky and even irritating, but still just trying to do his job. by the end, we sympathise with him. with freeman at his side and under the VERY assured direction of david fincher, se7en is an absolute winner; the most intelligent, darkest AND best thriller i've ever seen. as a bonus, we also get two of the most imitated credit sequences in cinema history. genius.

It's dark, it's disturbing, it's nauseating; but these very characteristics of Se7en are what makes it superior to any movie with a good idea but unable to make it sound. Brilliant story -that you do not expect from a thriller-, and an atmosphere that makes it a masterpiece, thanx to Mr. Fincher! The library scene with the parallel editing and ""Air"" is just another masterpiece alone (as well as the beginning credits sequence).

You may be amazed at the disturbing intensity, or may loathe it; but will not be indifferent..

8 April 2001,"Pounds of seriousness, ounces of content","Fairly idiotic serial killer cash-in with one-trick-pony gimmick - the killer does ""theme killings"" along the lines of the Seven Deadly Sins. (You know, Gluttony, Envy, Brad Pitt's performance in this, making movies like this, and the other three.)

One sin that some members of the audience might be guilty of after this is Sloth, since the thing goes on forever. The film treats its own silliness with the greatest respect for its own seriousness, and there is an amount of eye-catching visual stylisation along these lines of which the only connection to the emotional body of the film is via a long, long extension. Piddling around with lenses, you could call it.

Plotted along the lines of an old Batman TV episode (the serial crimes of the Joker, Penguin or Egghead were no more or less plausible, or inventive, or humorous for that matter), the writing is kind of reminiscent of Life Savers candy, except those are nothing without holes, and this is nothing with holes.

Brad Pitt's performance, striving for some sort of bizarre yuppie cool in a heroic struggle with the writers' apparent intention for the character, is possibly the most unlikely homicide detective in screen history. To be fair, Pitt's been a lot better in other movies. To be accurate, so has just about everybody else.

Stupid, modish, cynical picture. I believe the same director did ""Fight Club"". That's a much better movie, although the screaming plot holes and comic book dementia of the ending of that film bear a family resemblance to this one.",
20 March 2020,Se7en Review,"I ask myself why Se7en is so great? The answer to that question is rather simple because it was directed by David Fincher, who is known for being a perfectionist. Se7en is one of a kind. With its unrelenting dark and gritty visuals, David Fincher beautifully employs the use of rain, the twisted legal system and gore to create something which was both thrilling and well written. This film has a fantastic cast. From Freeman's controlled performance playing Somerset who loves books to Pitt's angry follows his gut who loves a chase. Yes, their partnership is pretty cliched, but it's forgivable because both Pitt and Freeman do such a remarkable job playing these characters. Not to mention that ending which will play in my mind for days after watching-something I adore in a film.

27 March 2004,Excellent Thriller with Great Character,"The establishing unit of Se7en suggest a standard entry into the cop genre. Summerset (Freeman) is tired of being a cop and of what he sees on the streets everyday. To top it off he has just been partnered with the new detective, and his replacement, Mills(Pitt), a know-it-all anxious to see some action. He even requires a metronome to fall asleep. Once the credit sequence starts, though, this movie is lifted much higher.

When they arrive at the first murder scene it appears that a morbidly obese man has eaten himself to death. Upon closer examination at an autopsy it is discovers that the man was forced at gunpoint and therefore murdered. Immediately there is a struggle for power between the two, Summerset telling the younger Mills that he is inexperienced and that it is to soon for him to be working a major murder case, thought at this point only by Summerset that it is the beginning of something more. He doesn't want it either but is stuck with it anyway.

Mills is instead handed the case of a murdered defense attorney. He gets there to find a pool of blood on the office carpet with the word ""Greed"" written with the same blood. Meanwhile, Summerset finds the word ""Gluttony"" written in grease behind the obese mans refrigerator. Thus begins the chase to find the man killing with the seven deadly sins.

The movie is dark. Very dark. If it weren't for DVD, Se7en would look like a giant black blur on home video. This is a very bold move on the part of David Fincher and Cinematographer Darius Khondji. Se7en needs to look this dark as it greatly improves the power of the visuals. The acting is superb, which brings be to the best parts of the film, the dialog scenes between Summerset and Mills. They give this movie a great sense of gusto with there quiet character moments. The time in between the murders, therefore, isn't wasted, making for a much more fulfilling experience.

Se7en is a great film with a climax that will stay in you head for days, and characters that you remember long after the shock is over.",

19 June 2022,Great plot but,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",8
24 April 2003,A Thriller Which Dares To Think,"Morgan Freeman has always been an extremely distinctive actor, be it his hair, his voice or even his general appearance. But he is also an excellent one, with this 1995 thriller being one of his finest roles to date. At first you think this film is just your bog-standard serial killer thriller, albeit an impressively shot one. However, as the film progresses, you realise that this film also deals with serious moral issues (witness the killer's denial that he has killed 'innocent' victims) and generally exudes such an overwhelming sense of depression it's hard to believe sometimes that you are watching the supposed real world. Throw in extremely brutal and sick killings, with the razor-edged dildo being a particularly gruesome standout, and excellent performances from Freeman, Paltrow and Pitt (who's arrogant, hot-headed Detective Mills is the template for his electrifying performance as Tyler Durden in the director's later film Fight Club.) But the real honours must go to Kevin Spacey. His serial killer 'John Doe' is a terrific role to play and he does so with admirable flair. The expression on his face when he is about to be shot by Mills makes your skin crawl and your flesh tingle. All in all, this is an extremely impressive film, which really needs to be seen on DVD in all its gory glory. Although perhaps not quite as brilliant as Fight Club, it is a journey into a place that you will never want to enter. Ever.",9
29 November 2002,One of the Only Classics Of the 90's,"Se7en has always caught my attention, and has always been my second favorite film of all time. From the fist viewing to the 10th, there were no signs of boredom. I have always been attracted to the ""edge of your seat"" thrillers, this one being the best of all in my opinion.

Twist endings are becoming somewhat customary in today's films. This film did not follow pictures like ""The Sixth Sense"", but came out 4 years prior to the commencement of the so called ""tricking the audience"" idea. Though even after seeing a whole truckload of movies with the now overused cliche of a surprise ending, you'll still be impressed with what this film has to offer. This tops my list of the greatest films of all time, somewhere in the top 5, it's hard to decide. Director David Fincher has supplied a very gritty & dark film. Almost film noire, almost horror and almost a thriller, but is in a class of its own.

18 December 2003,Unique,"First off, all the stuff that has already been said but should be reiterated anyway: Writing, Plot, Acting, Cinematography, Directing are all A+ here. But the thing that really strikes me about this film is how sympathetically John Doe is portrayed. This is rarely done (if ever) in mainstream cinema because it alienates a good portion of the audience. Se7en does it in a great way, however, because while the portrayal may be sympathetic, it doesn't make the mistake of making him an anti-hero. While the movie understands the reasons for his crimes, it still recognizes that he is a monster. Not for everyone, but deffinately a movie worth seeing.

25 July 2003,The Best Movie Ever!,"This movie is dark, depressing, and disturbing. But i can tell you it is great. Without a doubt the best movie i have ever seen. Everything is perfectly done. The best part about Se7en is they do not show the actual act of violece, but only the aftermath, which is very smart. I also love the fact that it is always raining until the last day, it makes it more disturbing.

1 January 2021,Gripping movie,"The beginning of the movie shows you who are the main heroes for the most of the movie (Pitt and Freeman) and maybe thanks to them it is more interesting than other movies of the same plot. Some of the scenes are quite predictable as well as the ending so I cannot rate it more than 8 out of 10. It is still one of the better movies with these two actors IMHO.

2 May 2014,GREAT concept and beginning thennnn...not so much,"I liked this movie from the moment it started. To me, mixing religion with anything makes 'anything' infinitely more creepy - and this film started out just that way.

I loved the premise of the movie and how each new crime is set up for the viewer. Also that the movie is set up in a world where each day seems grayer than the previous - and each crime more gruesome - it really does a great job of grabbing your attention from the first scene.

Morgan Freeman does an excellent job of a weathered, yet wise, detective - and then there is the Brad Pitt element. Ms. Paltrow does fine work in this movie. And then there is Brad Pitt...

I want to like Brad Pitt. Maybe it's just that I haven't seen the movie yet where he does a great job and doesn't seem like he's trying to act 'too hard'. I have a hard time believing his character in this movie (or any movie he's in for that matter). But, the other actors and the script for this movie do a great job of carrying him along.

Then there is the 'end' of the movie. I'm still annoyed by how this movie ended. The last scene seems to be in direct contrast with the imagination, set up, reveal, shock and get-you-by-the-short-hairs script used in the previous 80 minutes of this movie.

So...my 7 out of 10 basically means, for this movie - if it comes on - I will most likely get sucked into watching it again. And then when all the great scenes are over with and I've become weary of one person's acting - I will find that the last 10 minutes are a good point to realize, ""I've been sitting down watching enough TV today - time to go get something done. Like popcorn.""",7
23 November 2021,Great movie,"Well Kevin ruined the movie, obviously. I'd love to see this redone with an absolute different cast. It deserves the treatment... Please do it, we need it, need it...

Kevin Spacey 👎

28 February 2019,A Pure Masterpiece,"Se7en is a crime thriller directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. The film is about these two detectives who end up working together on a case of these unrelated murders happening in this unknown city in which they live in that all connect with the seven deadly sins (lust, pride, greed, sloth, envy, gluttony, wrath.)

Se7en can be described in three words: a violent masterpiece. The film takes on the idea of the seven deadly sins as their forefront for the crimes taken place in a creative, interesting and exciting way. The best part about this film is not showing the actual murders taking place. All the audience and the main characters see is the brutal and bloody aftermath of the crime. It fills the audience with a darker and violent imagination of what happened during the murders.

The acting in this film is top notch with some of the best performances I have ever seen with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Their chemistry in the film is perfect and seamless. As the film goes along, I totally forgot they were Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman anymore as they became their respective characters. This helps with the amazing writer that allowed the acting and chemistry to blossom and be so memorizing.

The story is the best aspect of this film as Fincher smartly makes the audience question what will happen next? We see this in most critically acclaimed thrillers, but this film doesn't let you know where this movie can potentially go because Fincher builds small clues and foreshadows as the moment of time happens in the film. Every scene in the film is important to the overall plot which makes the film feel so long by the end because you never feel like you wasted any time watching it. The climax of the film is one of the most exciting, edge of your seat climaxes I have ever seen. It has high blood pumping energy with great excitement that the film has built throughout its runtime that pays off so well.

The directing is so fantastic that I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for best directing at the 68th annual Academy Awards. Fincher uses great wide shots to capture all what's happening in the frame that keeps the audience in the moment. He carefully uses detailed close ups with his characters in deep emotional scenes that add an extra layer to the film.

The score, composed by Howard Shore, is an amazing score that adds so much to those intense scenes that gives the extra boost it needs to keep you on the edge of your seat. Whether its his dark and suspenseful music as the characters are investigating each crime scene or it's the intense energetic moving music in the action scenes, the score is used appropriately and effectively. As for the tech specs, the film has amazing cinematography done by Darius Khondji who uses a dark colored palate that is used perfectly with the gritty and dreadful tone of the film the use of light during many dark scenes was used perfectly as it didn't over bear the darkness of the setting. When the film used color, it used dark reds, yellows, etc. that gave a little tiny burst of life it needed to not look so dull and boring. Many filmmakers try to use this dark colored pallet and look for their movie because of the tone of the movie they are making, but it doesn't always work out because they don't know what they are looking to see.

The editing is practically seamless in which scene transition flowed so smoothly that it felt like the movie was shot all in one day chronologically. The action scenes also had incredible editing that it all looked real and presented well.

My only issues with the film are small but need to be addressed. During some of the action scenes, mainly in the middle where Mills is chasing down a potential suspect, there is a lot of ""shaky cam"" involved where it can be a tad bit distracting watching it, but not bad enough that it ruins the whole scene.

Overall, this film is one of the best films of all time due to its cast and production team. It has an engaging story that is always interesting and feels like something new is about to happen. The film is exciting, gritty, and dark in the best David Fincher way possible. The acting is superb, and the writing makes the film so enthralling throughout. I can recommend to anyone who wants to watch an pure masterpiece in the thriller genre. I give this a 10/10",8
16 July 2020,Thrilling / Great Performances,"A serial killer, out on the loose, murdering people following the seven deadly sins with two detectives investigating the cases.

A movie so gripping it makes you wonder that if you see a murderer one day, he won't be the devil with red horns as you want him to be. He'll just another man whom you greet on the road every day.

It takes you inside the mind of a serial killer and proves that we are the real evil that we look for in the criminals and murderers. The brilliant performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman makes the narrative so gripping and eye opening that it moves you and makes you rethink about your actions.

14 August 2017,review,"The movie, ""Se7en"", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.

The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.",8
4 May 2020,It's raining class,"Just watched again after many times but has been a while and oh my it still delivers. From the dreary back drop of a careless city (NYC I think) to the loneliness of its characters, Seven keeps you wondering what's going to happen to the very moment it dawns on you and John Doe reveals his hideous plan. From Morgan Freeman's intense yet soothing interest and study of the perpetrator to Brad Pitts insecure and naive behaviour yet courageous, this film is a rare gem of cinema, so many have tried to recreate.. you missed the bullseye. Thank you David Fincher for this razor sharp piece of cinematic genius!

Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

20 September 2018,What's your sin?,"Se7en's uniqueness delivers in an unimaginable variety of ways. It is perhaps the best thriller film of the entire 1990s. The tone is immediately set and maintains a dark, chilling a mood that stays relevant throughout the entire movie. While Se7en is slow-paced and lengthy, this only gives more development to the characters without crashing into common cliches. While an unlikely pair, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt deliver as very sturdy characters. And oh, Kevin Spacey! Truly the most chilling character he has ever played. His brief role towards the finale of the film portrays perhaps some of the best acting I have ever seen of him. Truly a must-see.

7 November 1998,Get sucked into a dark world of terror and sin.,"Se7en is definitely one of the absolute best films I have ever seen. The whole atmosphere is as dark and scarey as the actual killings and action. Morgan Freeman gives yet another excellent dramatic role who is sick of city crime but is unknowingly getting pulled into another game of violence. This is Kevin Spacey's best role as an actor for sure, he plays the part, and fits the characters needs perfectly. The only thing you can do to him in the movie is hate him to your fullest extent. For some people, they thought Se7en was too slow or dragged out, but I think that it just added to the depressing plot to make the film seem more real than you can immagine. If you have a weak stomach, I commend you for making it past the opening credits.

25 February 1999,Hands up all the emotionally numb who weren't permanently scarred by Se7en,"By the time I finished watching Se7en it was about 3:45am. If ever a film has left me feeling scarred or covered in dirt that won't wash off this was it. I wanted to roam the streets for a few hours and think this one out. I did this but I still felt terrible. Basically I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. Freeman was fantastic and I really enjoyed Brad Pitt's performance (what's with all the Pitt bashing here at IMDB). The climax is amazing, you sit there screaming at Brad not to do it, not to give in. But when he does you feel the full satisfaction of his vengeance. Films can change the way we view the world, this one especially.

23 November 1998,Deeply disturbing movie,"This movie is brilliant, shocking, grotesque and terrifying, not for what the characters do but for what the movie itself does to your psyche. It is well written and stylish. Kevin Spacey is wonderful as a nonentity whose function in the movie is as a collective mirror for all of humanity. Watching it, I suggest looking into John Doe's eyes after he gives himself up. Morgan Freeman is, as always, wonderful. Brad Pitt is good--watch as his frustrations with the case grow and grow. Everyone should see this for the truth in it...that your hatred for the killer is your hatred for yourself.

29 July 2000,A masterpiece!,"I have seen many movies in my lifetime and I know for a fact it's very hard to make a good dark thriller. I'm a movie freak and I love studying films, so I believe I know what I'm talking about when I say Seven is extremely well done. David Fincher is the director and does a brilliant job. Everything clicks here, the chemistry between the lead actors is amazing and every scene is worked so well that when you watch this you almost forget this is a movie and it's not real. Seven is as real as a movie can get, I'll tell you that. Very few dark thrillers have captured me like this one except maybe The Exorcist and Psycho. I have read some of the earlier comments about Seven here and I'm sure those who didn't like it either didn't watch it or got so scared while watching they began hating this film. I know my sister saw it and she was so scared watching it she didn't even wanna hear this films name!. So if u don't wanna see a disturbing dark thriller then don't see Seven!!!. Seven is very dark and raw and it's not for sensitive souls. But if u do wanna see a tough thriller and a good movie too then this is the one without a doubt!!!. The direction is super, the acting is outstanding and the climax is electrifying. I give this movie four stars out of four.

19 June 2003,"No, I don't","Some movies, like some literature, will change you. You can't watch ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" without wanting to be a better, stronger person. This is the first movie I've seen that I feel has actually made me a worse person. I would like to erase the experience from my life.

The fact that the movie is beautifully and strongly made only deepens the anger I feel toward the makers. Its only message seems to be, ""You want to see this--you know you do."" No, I don't.

14 February 2014,good movie without suspense,"i watched this movies honestly for Morgan and i love his acting. the acting over all was good i liked it but i think watching this movie in 2013 and rating it is not fair but as i did so i rated and reviewing as now a days i happen to watch a lot of movies like this and it seemed a typical story :( and it was predictable the killer ""at stairs with camera"" and at the end when movie name is seven and killer had murdered five people and a police man is chasing him and his wife....... is tired of his full devotion to work and being ignored and then she tells his fellow police office about her pregnancy ..... there are other two ....which will add to total of seven.

as i said early it is unfair to rate this movie in 2013 so sorry i did it in 2013

9 July 2000,Originality At Its Terrifying Best,"David Fincher lends his directing skills to help make Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay into one of the greatest serial killer movies ever made. This movie has everything. A cast of easily likeable characters. A demented but creative nemesis. A dreary setting. Witty dialogue. An original plot. One of the best endings in cinema history. The film focuses on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's characters, William Somerset and David Mills, who are both police detectives. Somerset is desperate to leave his job and Mills is excited to get in. They make a great team when it comes to finding an elusive serial killer who preys on people using the seven deadly sins as his preaching tools. Gwyneth Paltrow gives a terrific performance as Mill's wife Tracy. A superb acting job is done by the killer. I won't mention the actor's name in case you haven't seen the movie yet. This isn't one of those movies that you can guess the next scene before it comes. ""Seven"" is packed with surprises. This is a good movie for anyone with a strong stomach that enjoys fine acting and a great storyline. I recommend watching ""Seven"" at night with no interruptions. I wouldn't recommend eating during the film.",10
3 November 2002,Disturbing,"This may be the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. It is excellent and I hope no one ever makes another one like it for fear some fool will try to make life imitate art. Watch it and then try to sleep!

1 August 2023,One of my top favourites movies,"One of the strongest aspects of ""Seven"" is its masterful storytelling. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay takes viewers on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, exploring the darkest aspects of human nature. The movie skillfully builds suspense from the very beginning, leading to a heart-pounding climax that remains etched in the viewers' minds long after the credits roll.

Brad Pitt brings his raw intensity to the role of the young and impulsive detective Mills, and Morgan Freeman complements him perfectly as the wise and seasoned detective Somerset. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, adding depth to their characters and making their partnership believable and engaging.

""Seven"" is a psychological crime thriller directed by David Fincher, released in 1995, and it continues to be a timeless masterpiece in the realm of dark and gripping cinema. With a stellar cast, a compelling storyline, and a haunting atmosphere, ""Seven"" manages to captivate audiences and leave an indelible mark on their minds.

The movie revolves around two detectives, David Mills (played by Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (portrayed by Morgan Freeman), who are paired together to solve a series of gruesome murders that follow the seven deadly sins as a theme. As they delve deeper into the twisted mind of the serial killer, John Doe (memorably portrayed by Kevin Spacey), the audience is taken on an intense journey filled with tension, suspense, and moral dilemmas.

One of the strongest aspects of ""Seven"" is its masterful storytelling. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay takes viewers on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, exploring the darkest aspects of human nature. The movie skillfully builds suspense from the very beginning, leading to a heart-pounding climax that remains etched in the viewers' minds long after the credits roll.

The performances by the lead actors are nothing short of exceptional. Brad Pitt brings his raw intensity to the role of the young and impulsive detective Mills, and Morgan Freeman complements him perfectly as the wise and seasoned detective Somerset. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, adding depth to their characters and making their partnership believable and engaging.

Kevin Spacey's portrayal of John Doe is chillingly unforgettable. His calm demeanor and calculated mannerisms make the character all the more terrifying, and his presence looms over the entire film, even in his absence. Spacey's performance earned him well-deserved accolades and solidified his reputation as a talented actor.

David Fincher's direction is impeccable, creating an oppressive and gritty urban landscape that reflects the dark themes of the narrative. The film's atmospheric cinematography and expertly crafted sets contribute to the overall feeling of dread, heightening the impact of each disturbing revelation.

""Seven"" is not a movie for the faint of heart. It confronts the audience with gruesome and morally challenging scenarios, pushing the boundaries of conventional storytelling. It forces viewers to confront the evils that can lurk within society and tests their own sense of justice and humanity.

If there is any critique of the movie, it would be that some might find it too bleak and unsettling. However, this is precisely what sets ""Seven"" apart and contributes to its lasting impact as a cinematic gem. It dares to explore the darkest corners of the human psyche and challenges us to question our own capacity for good and evil.

In conclusion, ""Seven"" is a riveting cinematic experience that continues to be hailed as a benchmark for the psychological crime thriller genre. With its exceptional performances, gripping storyline, and atmospheric direction, the movie remains an enduring classic that will continue to haunt and enthrall audiences for generations to come. If you have the stomach for intense and thought-provoking cinema, ""Seven"" is an absolute must-watch.",10

15 August 2021,Dark and gripping but won't say the greatest,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",7
30 June 2020,YES! YES! YES! Yes.,"One of the best thrillers out there, hands down up and on the side. I won't say anything about Kevin Spacey but the cast was absolutely fantastic. Shocking images, scenes and really complex characters. Unbelievable!

13 January 2021,An intense and suspenseful movie that deserves all the hype.,"Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman did an amazing job on this movie. The use of the dark visuals and spine-chilling plot really pulls the movie together, and creates a suspenseful atmosphere that captivates you instantly. You can really tell the characters and plot was well thought out, and put together. There are many events that unravel throughout the plot that are both unpredictable and shocking.

24 December 2022,Hands down best in it's own genre,"Plot: It is so dark and sinister from the beginning to the end. It builds up...oh yes it builds up. One sick puppy is painting his masterpiece with the blood of the sinners (his view of the sin).

Detectives following his bloodtrails...well...they are merely spectators and not-enjoying the ride.

In a way i can see someone making a movie of that ""John Doe"" so we could find out what made him do what he eventually did. But on the other hand...it's better to let that ship sail to the sea as a ghost ship :)

I have seen all murder/serial killer-movies there are and this is by far...something that sets the bar. Amen.

Actors: If I would have 10 trillion hounds to sniff better cast for these roles and 10 trillion years time to do it...I wouldn't pick better ones for their roles. That triplet (Freeman, Pitt, Spacey) nailed it just perfect.

Twist: End was grim but also genious.

No spoilers but this truly is a masterpiece...very super grim one. I honestly think that. Since 1995 when this was released...no one has come even close to this horrible sinister masterpiece.

Seen that movie like 10+ times now (sad part is that I know everytime that the butler did) and it took me over 25 years to write this Jazz. Did it only because this one deserves to be on the top. 10/10.",10
9 August 2023,Se7en: detective with the best ending,"Se7en is an absolutely incredible movie in its genre, one of the best movies directed by David Fincher. The movie is about detectives who investigate crimes based on the 7 deadly sins.

Let's go through all the points to adequately rate the movie:

1) Plot - I give 1 point to the movie for its idea. The theme is quite off-the-beaten-path, especially in 1995. At that time, I'm sure, ""Se7en"" made a real sensation.

The second point goes to the movie for the smooth development of the plot: from incident to incident the heroes get more and more buried in the investigation, and each next crime is tougher than the previous one. Dialogues are also worth mentioning: they are perfectly written, meaningful, and there is no sense of any naïveté.

The third point is definitely for the logical ending. Nothing is broken - neither chronology, nor the original idea. The scenes ending the movie fit perfectly into the general plot and logically conclude it.

2) Actors' performance - the actors have a psychological correspondence with the characters. The main actors played their roles admirably: Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt showed the highest skill. They are really unconditionally believed throughout the entire timeline. Kevin Spacey also coped with the role 100% - moderately calm and cold-blooded, moderately cunning, moderately painful. Also +1 point.

One more, already the fifth point should be awarded to the movie for the stunning appearance of the characters. Each character corresponds to his clothes, behavior, atmosphere in the scene. As an example we can cite one character from the very beginning, this image is so memorable that it even found an echo in the music industry: German band Rammstein re-shot this scene for their Haifisch music video (2009).

3) The music - not much can be said about this one. It is concise, keeps the tension at the right moments, and otherwise skillfully accompanies the awesome video. A well-deserved sixth score for the movie.

4) Visuals - a lot has been said in the paragraph about the actors, and now we should mention their surroundings. All the sets, makeup, lighting, color correction - everything fits perfectly with what's going on. The movie is moderately dark, and this is to its advantage. The seventh point in the piggy bank.

The camerawork is marvelous. The angles, framing, shooting of dynamic scenes are flawless. The editing does not strain, the frame does not shake, there is a clear understanding of what is happening. There are also a lot of incredibly atmospheric scenes in the movie. +1 again.

5) The finale - oh, it's an absolute masterpiece. It is unpredictable, until the very beginning of the denouement the viewer has no idea what the antagonist's plan is. It shows a very emotionally powerful scene where the mind confronts the animal's anger and feelings. For the unobvious denouement I give the movie 2 points at once.

10 out of 10

Well deserved. Undoubtedly.",10
8 April 2002,Best movie ever made,"Of my top 10 movies, Se7en counts for 1 through 5. Fantastic dialogue, superb acting (OK Gwyneth but I've seen her do worse). The whole thing is totally believable (with the one exception of the 'keep out' tape on the inside) and let's face it most real life endings are not happy.

I have seen this movie over 50 times and I cannot think of many movies I have seen more than twice (Pulp fiction, Fight Club, Mulholland Drive, The Producers, Matrix, Bladerunner).

I have sympathy for John Doe's point of view as I am sure does Somerset.

Kevin Spacey is amazing, this breaks in his voice during the car monologue shows real psychotic emotion and the framing of the scene by Fincher is simplistic genius.

Pitt's acting at the end is truly gut wrenching and the subliminal flash is a clever touch used by Fincher again in Fight Club.

Watch this movie again and study it for the classic it is.",10

21 May 2002,Great movie,"This is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. Morgan Freeman is as incredible as usual, while Brad Pitt plays an overworked cop with a hot fiance (Cameron Diaz) Kevin Spacey is a magnificent actor, even when playing a deranged psycho who kills people who commit the Seven Deadly Sins. This is a great movie, but watch it with friends, or you might freak out. Happy Viewing Count Dooku :-)

19 June 2002,Dark and disturbing,"I didn't really think this film would have any effect on me, I thought it would just be another police cat and mouse story in which the two detectives hate each other at the start of the film and then end up becoming bestest buds by the end credits but it isn't that all. I wouldn't classify this as a horror film although when I was watching it, I felt as though I couldn't relax until the end credits came up on screen.

I think the person who wrote this must have a pretty vivid ( and not to mention disturbed) imagination. The deaths aren't just gory with a few lashings of tomatoe ketchup strewn around the 'corpse', no, I can take the blood and the huge obese man covered in stitches and bruises, its the actual form of killing and toture that I am amazed at. I mean where on earth did the writer come up with these disgusting forms of torture??

The acting was ok, although I often feel that Morgan Freeman plays the same character again and again. I'm disapointed that Kevin Spacey wasn't listed in the opening credits because, although short, his performance, once again, was magnificent and totally believable as John Doe.

If you like really imaginative deaths and lashings of gore, you'll like Se7en for its brilliantly directed portrayal of the dark and sinister underworld. Se7en is clever and stylishly directed and I am glad I watched it but I would never sit through it again. 6/10",
22 June 2002,The feelings..,"The amount of feelings that we experience watching this movie is incredible...An emotional rollercoaster that culminates in the very end of the movie with a brilliant Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, but a genious Kevin Spacey...Spacey really reveals in this movie. He's such a great actor that he makes you hate him, the true measure of an artist..either loved or hated, and Kevin does this very well..

17 August 2002,A religious conversion,"This is the film that got me back into cinema going. Having missed out on the pleasure for a number of years, mainly due to some poor releases, I finally bowed to pressure and tagged along to see what the silver screen had to offer. Wow, what a film to go back to, it has everything. From the edgy soundtrack to the rain sodden opening scenes the atmosphere ( which should be bottled and given to aspiring directors) grabs you by the throat from the very beginning. The plot unfolds beautifully, helped along by stunning performances and real chemistry from Freeman and Pitt, right up the the inevitable, but truly shocking conclusion. I left the cinema in silence. Once more a disciple

5 August 2003,Not gory!,"When you ask people about this movie, most of them will tell you that it is 'soooo gory'. Well, it's not! In fact most of the horror (except for the guy on the bed) is not visible on screen, it's created in your head. You never see a murder or any violence. You just see the crime scene or even only a photograph of the 'weapon' and then you reconstruct what happened in your mind. And this is what makes it so frightening because this way the horror is perfectly adapted to your very own fears. But this is just another genuine aspect of this truly outstanding thriller. Everything else also fits together just perfectly: the story, the acting (even Brad Pitt!), the design, the atmosphere and the cinematography. And the ending... well it's brilliant, surprising, hopeless and most important consistent.

Seven is simply the perfect movie - 10/10

17 October 2003,Those murders will plague me forever,"For those of you who have not seen Se7en, i suggest you don't see it after a heavy meal. Why? Because the murders, where victims are chosen using the seven deadly sins, are, how shall i say it?... Rank.

And if you do watch it, watch out of the Sloth murder. I watched Se7en a couple of days ago and the Sloth murder is STILL freaking me out. And i don't mean every now and then, but i'm talking about ALL the time!

It is still an excellent film, but be prepared to be haunted by the visions they portray

25 February 2004,a great flick,"An interesting story; a thriller that spins the audience as much as it spins the characters. One of my favorite movies: really everything you could ask for. David Fincher directs a really good movie, and Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and another ""mystery actor"" all give good performances. There are a few flaws, but they can be excused as a result of the depth and intensity of the characters. The ending is a little disappointed (and somewhat unexpected), but the viewer will stay attentive throughout. Definitely worth watching, and definitely worth watching again. Seven is as intense as movie as has been made in the past decade.

5 December 2004,Great Thriller,"Having attempted to write suspenseful, original and interesting

scripts, I have a great appreciation for the cleverness of the writing

and ploting in this thriller. So much is truly original and interesting

that I was transfixed watching it unfold. Three cheers for the

writer(s). Only thing that took me out of the film was the shift from what

appears to be New York City for most of the movie, to the power

grid scene, shot in territory I am intimately familiar with, Southern

California desert. Oh well. A small glitch in a wonderful thriller. Great writing, acting and

execution, If you will pardon the pun. JP",
29 April 2005,Not your average mystery,"A high IQ and severe insanity is a dangerous combination. No film proves this better than Seven. Kevin Spacey plays John Doe, an independently rich, extremely intelligent, and severely disturbed serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins (pride, lust, gluttony, sloth, envy, anger, greed)as the inspiration for a series of deaths in a lower class city. It is also a plus that film stars Morgan Freeman, who in my opinion could be the greatest actor of all time, as one of the detectives attempting to catch him. The only thing that hurt the movie for me was that I felt that Brad Pitt tended to overact in some of the scenes. Let me just end this by saying that the ending of this film is guaranteed to leave you completely stunned.

19 January 2006,A masterpiece!,"Se7en is an amazing movie in so many ways. It is, in fact, my favorite movie, and here is why:

To me, the story and themes in Se7en are incredibly interesting and well thought out. It is not so much the murderer, the killings, and the police work that matter, it's what lies beyond these. The movie deals with the fundamental ways with which we look at life. This is demonstrated best by the diametrically opposite views of detectives Mills and Somerset, respectively, but also the views of the killer, in contrast to their views. Apathy is the key word here, while Choice is another important factor, which is intrinsically connected to Apathy. Apart from this, the story is masterfully told; it does not rush anything. It takes its time to make the points it needs, which are plenty, without seeming to add any superfluous elements.

The technical aspects are pure genius. Not only is everything executed flawlessly, but put together it all has a certain synergy that makes it all seem, well, better than perfect, really. The cinematography is excellent. Many of the camera angles are different, but not weird or artsy just for the sake of being either of those. The visuals have a sharp purity to them, and are incredibly clean. So clean, in fact, that you can see the dirt and dust in the air at times (particularly in the Gluttony crime scene.) Many scenes are somewhat dark and gray, for instance all the rain, but it is shown so artfully, which makes them incredibly interesting instead of just depressing. This depressing motif is highly fitting to the themes the movie deals with, though, so it is not at all out of place or misused, in order to try to just seem artsy or dark.

The sound and music is not just good, but so fitting and so well done that it actually enhances the experience of the movie, something I feel sound and music are supposed to do in movies  and not just in the simple and cheap way tension music does it in so many thrilled and horror movies. Both the sound and music go in and interact with the visuals (or the other way around) on just about all situations in the movie. Like the very first scene, where we see Somerset in his kitchen, where the ambient sound actually goes in and gives us audio clues to the surroundings and situation. Or the legendary (often since copied, never outdone or equaled) intro title sequence, where the titles and the gritty, almost evil visuals move and shake in sync with the industrial grinding of Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"". A scene standing in stark contrast with that one, but no less interesting, is the Library scene, with Bach playing in the back (until it slowly moves into the front). It is an incredibly aesthetically pleasing scene, almost like a fully fitting music video for one of the most soothing pieces of classical music around.

There are many other scenes that merit at least a page each of praise on the audio and visual aspects, like the Lust scene, the Interrogation scene, the Chase scene and the scenes from the movie's finale, but there is simply not room for it here.

The acting is also dead on. It is just so fitting that it becomes great. Freeman has an aura of experience and intelligence over him, but also a strong sense of having given up and resignation that often shows, as the character is supposed to be portrayed. Pitt might not have gotten equally appreciated with his effort, but living up to Freeman is no easy task. I feel Pitt, with his impatience and visible energy, does an incredible job, playing the diametric opposite to Somerset, which in my mind is the exact way that character is supposed to be portrayed, as well.

The movie, I feel, leaves you stunned. It gets the point across better than any movie I have seen, not just by cheap shock effects, but by a deep, disturbing rumbling that culminates in terrible realization. It does indeed get your attention by hitting you with a sledgehammer.

As a final note, I would like to mention that the amount of gore and violence seen in the movie is not great. Strangely, many people seem to think so. They claim the movie was too harsh and violent, but when you confront them with this, it turns out they only got this impression, but didn't actually see anything. This, I feel, is a testament towards the skill with which the director so expertly implies these things, instead of going for cheap, visual thrills and shock effects by actually showing all the gore.

And that is why Se7en is my favorite movie.",10
19 March 2020,"Qualified actors,unique atmosphere,deep and meaningful story with exciting.","A masterpiece with fascinating noir atmosphere that exactly fits story.

2 December 2017,A Good Mystery Film!,"Very good movie. But could have been better. The killings took place too quickly one after another. The director could have gone for more suspense between the murders. However, the final 2 murders were just awesome (!) in the sense that it really made suspense. The ending was brilliant. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were great. And Kevin Spacey did justice to his cameo role as a real cold blooded murderer. Overall a good modern noir movie. I like the movie and rate it 8 on 10. I cannot give it a 9 because of the reasons mentioned in the beginning of my review.

The only issues I have is a book reading/researching scene (That goes on FAR too long, but I understand the intent), and the overuse of classical music. At first, some of the usage was interesting, but it just got repetitive and grating by the end of the film. The acting was great, the direction was great, and overall this is a very good movie.

20 January 1999,"A vastly superior,slick hollywood thriller.","Although I was a little disappointed after seeing this film (due to all the moronic children who spread the myth that it was a meanigful insight into the serial killer mind set) I now appreciate it for what it truly is...a jerry bruckhimer type hollywood thriller...The direction is almost faultless(i.e,the rain and lack of on the final day type symbloism) the performances good enough..apart from spacey occasionely hamming it up.Then comes the ending..at least the trick ending here was a means to an end..unlike the terrible usual suspects which relied on the ending as its sole point.Overall a fun entertaining and money worthy thriller..sure beats enemy of the state. p.s..for a real serial killer film that scares get hold of leanoard schraders(pauls brother)Documentary.The Killing Of America.

2 February 1999,Really good movie with a weak ending,"Very good ""on-the-edge-of-your-seat"" thriller that unfortunately suffers from a predictable ending. This one does have one of the best ""scream-scenes"" that I have seen in a very long time. Worth watching.

6 November 1999,Best serial killer movie ever-made.,"When I was viewing Se7en for the first time, I anticipated it as one of those films that scares you with blood based upon all this talk of how gory it was. I definitely did not expect it to be the intelligent, philosophizing, brilliant piece of film it was. The script is very well-done especially in the dialogue of Morgan Freeman's character. Good acting all-around but my hat goes off to the actor who plays the killer (I won't divulge his name) but it's definitely the actor's best performance ever and it's what makes the film so great. Many have put Se7en on a pedestal with Silence of the Lambs as the best serial killer movies ever but in my book it goes one notch higher.

30 June 1999,A TRULY disturbing film!,"Se7en is one of those movies that leaves you feeling, well, creepy. Not many films can make you feel the way this one does, and for that, I hold director David Fincher in the highest of respects. The greatest part in Se7en though, is when you find out who plays John Doe! OOOOOHHH! Isn't he WONDERFUL?!?! SO scary!!!

9 December 2006,Terrible character interaction,"I am really surprised by all the positive comments by IMDb users, especially the ones saying how great the acting is.

I found the acting from the three main characters (Freeman, Pitt and Paltrow) to be each shallow at best; particularly annoying were Paltrow's wispy-ness, Pitt's lame attempt at expressing emotions, and Freeman's overdone weariness. All three actors have had excellent performances in other films, so I blame the written dialog.

The Plot is vaguely interesting, and the editing acceptable, but ultimately I found the character's stereotypes and interactions disappointing.

14 June 2021,Too busy chasing the killer,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10
19 June 1999,A great movie. I loved it!,"I'll quickly tell you about myself. I am 14 years old and I was 11 when I first saw the movie. I think that Seven is very good and worthwhile to see.

In some parts it was quite violent, but the violence made sense in the story line. I think it was very good because it made you wonder what would happen next. It had a very surprising ending, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it.

The other review paints it as being shocking and violent. I personally don't think it was as bad as he made it out to be. After all we shouldn't worry about fiction movies.

The movie stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow. The person who acted best in this movie I think was the infamous Brad Pitt, as Detective Mills.

The story is about a murderer who kills people due to the seven deadly sins...eg. gluttony, wrath, pride. The way he kills the people turns them agains the sin.

I would give this film 9.5/10!!!",
5 June 2021,One of my favourite movies!,"I can watch this movie over and over. Great story, incredible actors. Everytime I watch, something new pops out.

16 August 1999,a masterpiece,"Se7en is simply a masterpiece--one of the most disturbing movies ever made. Profound, intelligent, visceral, compelling, and masterful describe this chilling look at the mind and methods of a literate, brilliant and articulate serial killer. Persons who like shallow, escapist entertainment with lots of explosions will probably not like Se7en, which deals with very deep and disturbing issues, and actually requires the viewer to THINK, unlike most movies today. The film is not perfect, as no film is ever perfect, but the few minor flaws (there are no major ones, in my opinion) are far, far outweighed by the things this movie does right. The acting by Freeman, Pitt, Paltrow and the unbilled killer is uniformly top-notch; the dark, gothic quality of much of the movie compliments the subject matter quite well; the music is haunting and spare; the gore and implied violence are never gratuitous, but merely to serve as important and visceral indications of the mindset of the killer, who chooses his victims and murders them according to the Seven Deadly Sins of literature: Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Envy, Pride, Greed, and Wrath. The climax is a gut-wrenching finish to one of the most compelling movies ever made. I suspect that many people who do not *like* this movie and criticize various aspects of it are more disturbed by it than they would admit--it is not for everyone. One of the best films of the 90s, and superior to Silence of the Lambs.",
27 June 2000,A top notch movie with a gut-wrenching climax.,"Se7en is one movie you will never forget. Morgan Freeman as always has made yet another masterpeice just like Kiss The Girls, Outbreak, and The Shawshank Redemption. Brad Pitt was amazing in this movie just like Legends of the Falls. The Seven deadly sins which are gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. Seven Deadly Sins. Seven Ways To Die.

1 March 2004,Thought before action,"If you would like to explore David Fincher, you should start out with this magnificent piece of art work. Even after 9 years the movie seems very fresh to me. Movie's two dichotomous detectives complement each other perfectly. We observe full speed action from Pitt. For Freeman it is always thought before action. He would like to understand this crazy world. Literature might be the key to understanding things. Terrific acting by Freeman, Pitt and Spacey. Having watched Fight Club and Se7en, I won't miss any feature directed by Fincher. He always directs clever movies which brings new questions to your mind. Straight 10/10.

11 April 2019,Timeless masterpiece,"Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.

I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.

14 January 2007,"Could have been justly titled: ""The flashlight mystery tour""","An excellent film in every department, but the unrelenting darkness of almost every scene, and the persistent rain, made watching it slightly irksome. Although I didn't see it credited, there must have been someone appointed to keep the torch (flashlight) batteries fully charged, as I have never seen such profligate use of torches, whether hand-held or attached to weaponry. And why do film directors love rain so much? I don't remember glimpsing the sun at all in this film - so no contrast in the weather. However, the stark contrast between Somerset and Mills did bring a little sunshine to my viewing. ""Se7en"" grabbed my attention from the beginning and held it throughout, although I found my credibility being stretched on occasion. It is difficult to pinpoint these more dubious parts of the plot without giving at least some of the story away, but viewers should be prepared for the odd raising of a questioning eyebrow.

The quality of acting is great, the storyline superb, and everything down to the tiny details like the opening credits match perfectly with the mysterious, creepy feel of this film. It has both Hollywood star power and small studio care in the making and editing. And what an ending! If this movie were put out today with the awards these actors have won and the names they've made for themselves it would reign for months in theatres and get a few Academy nods. A suspense thriller for all time.

1 May 2022,"Probably a good flick back then, (27 years ago)","I assumed to know what the ""what's in the box"" reference meant, but hadn't watched Se7en before, so my wife, having previously seen it, suggested we watch it.

Se7en is a movie. It's not all that intriguing, it's not mind bending in regards to what's on tv or streaming today, and not accurate even in a police drama, or entertaining.

What I'm used to seeing in a cop drama is that homicide detectives are never first on scene. Unless they did things differently 27 years ago, I have it baked into my mind that there is a hierarchy of crime scene analysis that arrive at different stages of the investigation.

This movie doesn't follow that thought process.

There are great examples of talent with the protagonists, however with so much dialog, the movie ends up just spinning it's wheels and several doldrum occur and the film forces the audience to wade through the relentless exposition to get to the next act.

I saw it. I now know for sure what's in the box. I wouldn't say the movie is the icon masterpiece of a filmography so many people give it credit for. It surly doesn't stand the test of time.

I think this film is so hipped by those who promote it, because of a nostalgia factor for the many that saw it ""in it's prime"" with the new-ness of it all.

Just to note the times were currently living in, I have seen more gore and have been desensitized to the more gruesome just by watching The CW's Supernatural or Dexter. Lol.",4

4 September 2001,superb!!!,"Alright,I want to make something clear here...this is a movie which probably showcases the sickest and most gruesome deaths ever! And I loved it. David Fincher has a way of pulling the audience in,making them think...if you're looking for a movie to relax your mind and just be entertained,then don't watch this movie. But if,like me...you are planning to watch something intelligent,something which will make you ponder and think about,something different...this movie is what you're looking for.

The basic plot of this movie is that there is a serial killer on the loose. He is a mastermind,carefully planning his murders for years and executing them perfectly...he does his murders according to the 7 deadly sins which are--gluttony,greed,lust,sloth,pride,envy and wrath. He feels that the world is messed up and he thinks that by committing these murders,he will be preaching to the people. 2 detectives are on the case,Det. Somerset and Det. Mills. Somerset is about to retire,but this case holds him back. He has had years of experience and is thoughtful of every case he handles.Mills is a newly posted detective and is very impatient when it comes to identifying clues and analyzing problems. To tell you more would be grave injustice...you have to watch it to understand more and form opinions of your own.

The acting is done superbly by the 2 leads,Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. Freeman plays Det. Somerset flawlessly and seems born to do the role. The ever-knowing Freeman is truly a character to be praised. Pitt is also fantastic,fitting perfectly in the role of Det. Mills. His acting is just the way you would expect a young detective to be. Pitt is fast gaining my respect as a high caliber actor. Although he has made stupid decisions before (Legends Of The Fall and Meet Joe Black), it's roles like this and Tyler Durden (Fight Club) that he truly shines. I really hope to see him more in movies of the same class. With these 2 brilliant actors helming the movie,how could it go wrong. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Mills' wife in the movie, a sweet,kind hearted soul just looking for a quiet and nice home with a loving family. The killer,who is uncredited...and I will leave it at that, also gives a superb performance.

The directing is really something to appreciate. Fincher creates the same bleak and dark atmosphere throughout the movie. It never stops raining and people get killed,mugged and raped at every corner of the street. It is really hard to believe,that Fincher was directing music videos once...his transition seems to be flawless. I have watched every movie of his and found each of them intriguing (except Alien 3). The storyline is amazing and it is just haunting to see the details of each murder potrayed so realistically in the movie.

In the end, you will realize something.A message should hit you. If it doesn't...then obviously,you didn't understand the movie. Watch this movie! You won't regret it.",
11 November 2001,Simply the best serial killer movie to date.,"Se7en is simply the best serial killer movie released to this day. Silence of the Lambs is a close second. But Hannibal's motivation was some sort of insanity. John Doe has a purpose, which , while it might not be what most of us would define ""sanity"" as, is believable. Pitt is phenomenal, Freeman is his usual brilliant self. And the ending.. is unforgettable.

7 October 2001,Darker than black itself...,"I believe it was Sophocles who once said: 'How dreadful the knowledge of the truth can be when there is no help in truth!'.

Se7en carries the same struggle as it lurks and creeps behind the film's agony. The plot is very simple. An unknown murderer has started a murderous spree using the seven deadly sins as his motive. Two detectives are involved with the case: Sommerset, an intelligent man ready to retire within a week and Mills, a rookie detective believing that he can break all the enigmas. The film is intensely dark and pessimistic and in fact there is no hope anywhere. The deaf citizens walk in the street, the cars drive through the traffic and the whole city resembles an urban atrocity. The name of the city is never mentioned but it appears as if David Fincher attempted to use a mixture of New York, Chicago and Philadelphia's outskirts which does not find a way to perceive itself into the viewer's tastes. It always rains and we never see a welcoming day. Even if there is light, they're hopeless pools of luminosity reflecting the dead surfaces that live within Fincher's world.

The characters are acted astonishingly. My favourite is Morgan Freeman's character, Detective William Sommerset. He plays an intellectual outcast of the city that no longer feels pity to help it breath again. He is a typical chess player: he picks his words carefully and cautiously plays his actions to a person. He has lost hope in humanity and only strives to work because it is the only object that allows him to express his hate to himself and the city. To others he seems bossy, prude and unpatient but he has a right to be. I presume that most people after seeing the film will relate to him more than the rest of the characters. Brad Pitt's Detective David Mills is probably the only character that smiles without any force. He is young, energetic and aims to do the best for his job. His wife, played my Gwyneth Paltrow also plays a part to keep the film carry a little bit of optimism. She is pregnant and does not want to tell her husband because she is confused of whether to grow a child into this corrupted city or have an abortion. The only person who knows about it is Sommerset. The film's ending holds one of the most disturbing scenes ever to be portrayed in the world of cinema. It isn't gory but just astonishingly shocking, having the ability to outrage any strong mind just because of the whole surprise that awaits directly into the end. Since this film was out a long time ago it will do no harm for me to mention the killer's (John Doe) performer who is Kevin Spacey. We only meet him during the late end of the film but he has one of the most interesting lines as he talks to the two detectives about the objective of his murders as they head along to pick up two more bodies. The scene where they show his apartment is beyond imagination; it actually describes his personality. He is a smart man gone insane. A typical example of a perplexed and bewildered person who no longer sees the need to carry with the laws of the community but the need to change them.

The film has its religious entangements but in the end it is not only concerned with the principality of religion but of the struggle to make a transitional move in society. Any non-religious or atheistical person will adore this film because it guarantees to represent the image of a world gone mad, deceased and lost in its oblivion. It's better to not mention the film's disturbing parts because they will reveal themselves whether the audience will like it or not. Since the WTC bombings, this film may not be pleasing to many people as it leaves them combined with an emotional end reaction. It is the kind of film that searches a place in the mind and locks itself indisputably. Fincher's FIGHT CLUB was more optimistic than this as it was filled with the of a dark humour but in my personal opinion this stays Fincher's best work so far and probably one of the best film of the 90s Hollywood shelves.

You will be confused, frightened and left into a pit of uncertainty. Enjoy.",
17 May 2003,More than expected!,"Se7en is and always will be an excellent movie. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow led a wonderful cast. The cast and crew gave me so much more than what I expected. It is an amazing movie in which I will never forget. It also contains the best ending that I have ever seen in my life.

28 January 2010,Shivers down the spine ...,"I've seen this movie at least ten times, and every time it's getting better then the last time. I have been paying much attention to the script, in order to find some mistakes, because I couldn't believe that such a script was viable. But it is. Andrew Walker is a genius, a fact proved by Seven and consolidated by 8MM. Never mind the acting. Freeman, Pitt, Paltrow and Spacey are multiple Oscar winners and nominees, so we're not talking about them. It goes without saying. As for David Fincher, the movie is obviously his masterpiece (along with Fight Club, of course). The movie is ... just mind blowing. The atmosphere is raw, and unstudied, and it all happens very fast, flowing towards the ending. And as John Doe grins at the end, knowing that he TRULY is the victor, the tension rises every time, and the musical score just makes you breathe on the edge of the seat, that's when the truth is revealed ... to be one of the greatest movies ever made. You shouldn't try to watch it. You HAVE TO watch it. Otherwise you've lived for nothing.

31 December 2002,such a fantastic movie,"so good. one of the best ever, and possibly my favorite movie. yes, it is disturbingly gory, perhaps too much so for squeamish people, but it really takes the idea of ""the world is a terrible place"" and sticks it in your eye. movies like this, american psycho, and requiem for a dream help me reinforce the idea that out in the world, there's some nasty things going on. somerset's final line in the film

""Ernest Hemingway once wrote, the world is a ... "" crap, I forgot the exact quote. but it's along the lines of ""the world is a wonderful place, and worth fighting for. I believe in the second part""

really captures the entire point of the film.

10/10 hands down. the people who probably won't appreciate this movie are the people who aren't cynical and are optimistic.",10
12 May 2023,Creepy and really really exciting,"WOW - what a thriller of a move. Really really exiting and I love the way how we get to know the main characters. Great picture for this kind of movie - you get the right feelings of the environment and how cold, nasty and chilling it is in all the scary places/rooms that they are in, in the course of the whole movie.

Also, love the part about the guys playing poker in the library - clever way of putting in a ""stereotype"".

As well as a lot of the reviews for this movie - it is just perfect in all ways. Of course, if you know the seven deadly sins, you might have a gut feeling of what to come, but now person ever can guess what's coming all the way #spacey.

19 January 2022,Seven times to think and reflect.,"The film keeps in suspense and does not suffer from a lack of action or protractedness. A very interesting performance, catchy and creepy at the same time. The genre of thriller and detective is perfectly sustained. Musical accompaniment. Gloomy tones and not at all a rosy moral atmosphere. On the contrary, the further the action unfolds, the harder and deeper the conflict of the characters goes, and the more tragic and scary it becomes to watch all this as a spectator. The final - it surprises with its unexpectedness (especially if you watch the film for the first time). Scary and makes you think.

12 January 2023,One of the best films I've seen,"Se7en was not what I expected at all from big names in the industry like Brad and Morgan. The tone was extremely dark and gloomy with pretty grotesque and shocking imagery that genuinely had me hooked.

The twist at the end was pretty horrifying it's definitely something that stuck with me afterwards , I've seen a lot of gory / shock films but I think the idea of someone able to get away with these types of crimes is insane and makes you wonder what type of serial killers are out running.

I wanted to keep this pretty short because it's a film that explains itself better and It's not worth ruining any of the key moments you need to pay attention to.

The music drowned out the barely hearable lines. It seemed to me like they whispered through the whole movie. I couldn't get into this movie at all. A friend of mine recommended this movie. I no longer take advice from this friend. This movie is worse than Ishtar. Gigli seems like an academy award movie compared to seven. I watched seven all the way through and couldn't tell you what it was about. Totally confusing. How this movie got in the top anything is beyond me. It should have been in the bottom hundred.

30 December 2022,Dang it Mills!,"Riveting from beginning to end. You always know that if Brad Pitt's in it, something crazy is going to happen, and this film certainly delivered on that. Am I absolutely livid at the end? Yes I am. Does it make me love this movie less? No. Brilliant and horrifying, I found it impossible to tear my eyes away for even a moment. This is one of those moves that just sticks with you, both because of how macabre it is and how fascinating the message. Trust Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman to give a fantastic performance, they're the on-screen we didn't know we needed. Amazing cinema, beautiful execution, and scarringly incredible.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",
22 August 2003,A brilliant film,"It is hard to sum up the greatness of this movie. The dialogue captures the complexity of characters in conflict with themselves. Of course, the words would be nothing without the delivery of the incredible cast. The film rises to a crescendo, and crashes its way into your memory permanently. It was one of the first four DVDs that I purchased many years ago. If you get a chance, search out a copy of the original screenplay. It stays a little truer to the theme, but didn't have the same ending as the final movie.

19 November 2011,"Excellent movie, Must see.","This movie is what I call a solid, A+, suspense/crime movie. It was innovative and very well-written. The cinematography in the movie was chilling with most scenes being dark or rainy thus adding to the effect. There is only one focus on this movie and that is Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman)'s journey to find a psychopath killer (Kevin Spacey) who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his guide. We see each murder as a crime scene as opposed to the murders happening; this I thought, added to the suspense of finding out who this killer is. The crimes lead up to probably one of the biggest twists in cinema history. It will have you guessing, what will happen? Everything will go through your head, and you will probably be wrong.

This movie, just like Fight Club, proved that Brad Pitt is not just a pretty face. His acting skills alongside Morgan Freeman are salute-able. Freeman is great in just about any movie just as this one. And Kevin Spacey...his work was phenomenal. His character is probably one of the most remarkable ones ever; and he aced at bringing him to life. Gwyneth Paltrow was also in the movie as David Mill's wife. Her parts weren't too big, but she still did well.

I highly suggest watching this movie if you like a good mystery/scary movie. It will defiantly stick to your head after watching. Movies rarely ever scare me, but this one came really close.",9

20 November 2004,Perfect,"Perfect. The only word to describe the brilliance before my eyes. Brilliant directing, acting, writing, soundtrack... everything worked together to make a superb thriller about a serial killer following the Se7en deadly sins. Mills has requested transfer to homicide in New York, Somerset is retiring. Bodies start piling up, and the investigation starts. Somerset reluctantly teaches Mills what he can. The art direction in this film is breathtaking. Every scene will leave you wanting for more. Every time I watch the credits roll I want to start the movie over. While the ending was changed slightly from the original script, I think it is for the better. This one goes down in the books my friends, a must see, especially if you are a David Fincher fan.

Suspense 10/10

24 November 2003,The Best (maybe!),"Definately one of the best movies I have ever seen. David Fincher is GOD! Seven, The Game and Fight Club are all 9-10 rated movies in my books. Alien 3 was good (I liked it. Many don't agree). Panic Room wasn't bad, but not good either. I really like Finchers gloomy and depressing pictures and style. Really refreshing in these ""happy-go-easy-times""! I am happy to see, that nearly all who rated this movie really liked it as well. Maybe we'll see more of this type of movies later, when everyone like it.

18 March 2004,"Disturbing,dark,yet also a brilliantly filmed, compelling mystery/suspense","Many people might be put off by the gruesome and twisted experiance that is director David (Fight Club) Fincher's suspense film. However, if you choose to be more tolerant about the graphic nature of the film, you will find it to be a suspenseful,exhilerating, masterpiece of shadows and thrills.

The film revolves around a burnt out cop (Morgan Freeman)and his new, hot shot partner(Brad Pitt) who are investigating a string of very gruesome murders. It soon becomes clear the killer is using the Seven Deadly Sins (Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride, Envy, and Wrath) as his motive. The film is shot mostly in rainy, dark locations which intrigued me at first but soon got boring. However, just when you think the film will drop on its rear, it gets interesting again. The acting is a wonder. Morgan Freeman plays the burnt out detective with his usual charm and charisma and Brad Pitt is believable as Freeman's partner up until the last scene, which I felt like he was trying to hard to cry. Kevin Spacey, however, steals the show as the sadistic murderer. He is both terrifying and attractive and portrays pure insanity like no other actor I've ever seen.

20 August 2004,One of the Best Serial Killer Movies,"Seven, director David Fincher's best film has everything a thriller of this sort needs, good direction, good acting, suspense, deeply disturbing images, and a good killer. This film was before Kiss the Girls, Copycat, Along Came a Spider and Taking Lives, and each of these films have taken from Seven. The film has a dark mood(it's always raining) and a very gritty look to everything. The acting is perfect, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are a great team of cops and Kevin Spacey puts in a very good job. One thing I thought was genius was using the Nine Inch Nails song for the titles sequence. This with Fight Club are David Fincher's masterpieces.

Made over $100 Million at box office.

29 July 2009,A Brilliant Film,"This film is a fantastic piece. One of the best you'll see from any genre. The story propels you forward right from the start and doesn't stop until the final scene. This propulsion starts early once the main title sequence begins. It's mesmerizing, and sets the mood brilliantly. Even the end credits are done in such a way that becomes unique to the story. The locations, production design, and cinematography work seamlessly to create such a perfect world, that's found in no other film. In addition, the two leads, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, are so diametrically opposed in almost every way, creating an interesting chemistry on screen. As often as I've seen this film, I never tire of it.

2 January 2023,Masterpiece,"The film keeps your attention at all times. There're no obvious holes in the plot you'd find after watching it. A stomach is definitely needed for this movie. It has a lot of disturbing pictures and the story itself is disgusting. The characters are well written you know just the perfect amount of all of them. The only thing that was not perfect is that the plot twist at the end was a bit predictable - at least for me - and that killed the excitement a bit. Overall it is a masterpiece both from the perspective of the plot and the acting. If I could i would give it a 9.8 but it is not a 10 for me because of the predictability.

9 March 1999,Disturbing and astounding,"Recently I viewed the movie Seven after much prodding from those around me, saying that it would scare the bejeezus out of me. Well, it certainly did that, but it also gave me a very enjoyable viewing experience of an outstanding movie. Pitt and Freeman both turn in outstanding performances as well as the maniacally sane Spacey who gives his second best performance after his amazing role in The Usual Suspects. To me, the movie had the feel of Bladerunner including the crowded feeling that is gave as well as the constant rain. It certainly was disturbing but more so it was frightening. Seven was definitely not as disturbing as Apocalypse Now or even Pulp Fiction. All in all, it is a great movie, and one of the best if a scare is what you're looking for.

As for the climax one of the best thriller climaxes I have ever witnessed, Pitt's facial expressions alone let the viewer feel his suffering, and predictament. Perfect 10 for Se7en.

16 December 1998,Neo-Gothicism,"Well for starters, if you haven't seen Seven, get to the local store and rent it. Personally, it made my top 5 movies #1. However my taste leans directly on this Neo-Gothicism that has been winning over people for about the last 20 years by using the dark-realism of Gothic architecture, acting, lighting,speech, all combined with this new sense of Evil that has been felt by nations seemingly since the 80's, when we supposedly sold our souls . Other selections much like 'The Crow','The Silence of the Lambs' , 'Dark City' and even to an extent 'the Devil's Advocate' remove the viewer from their safe-seats, and sits them on the rained-gritty street corner where a whispered conversation is taking place. It removes that false sense of security that watching years of 'Happy Days' can give you. For me, Seven was deeply philosophic (obviously), and I probably don't go a day without some reference to it. However, the reason it digs so deep into us, is that it is absolutely possible. Your average nutcase could copycat this movie, and claim insanity at the trial. Enjoy!

I have seen this film over a dozen times now, and i still see something new within the film every time i see it. this, as a psychological movie, is the best that has been made - better even than the overrated Silence of the Lambs.

11 February 1999,"Hot damn, wonderful movie...","I loved this movie.... The element of the seven deadly sins turned what otherwise could have been a decently made thriller into a deeply affecting and powerful movie... The gore content has been over-rated, it was not gory so much as the methods used by John Doe are psychologically disturbing -- I'm a gore wimp, I don't watch horrors, but the sick nature of the murders didn't scar me deeply, or anything... So be warned, while not overly gory, the movie is twisted....... Ok, I can admit that I could foresee the movie somewhat, but the foresight didn't prepare me for it in any way... And I have to add one thing -- my favourite method used by John Doe would have had to be Pride... It allowed the victim to repent..... Dunno what I mean? Watch the movie!!! Wonderful movie, but twisted, my current favourite....

8 May 1999,Excellent,"This thriller has got it all; A very scary plot, excellent performances ( Freeman is fantastic), hair-rising score but the thing that makes this picture so great is the camerawork. When Brad Pitt is chasing the killer through an apartment-building it feels so realistic and it's because of the tremendous camerawork.

Another great thing that's so great is the odd-couple story. The white-cop-black-cop thing doesn't feel silly, as in the lethal weapon-movies.

And of course the ending. The fantastic ending ( one of the very few times the killer wins)

And Gwyneth Paltrow makes this disgusting film beautiful in a couple of scenes... 10/10

Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey do some of their best work here, each showing us the various aspects of the dark side of human nature. Spacey, in particular, is spectacular in his portrayal of the man who questions our contemporary society's flaws. The film is visually awesome, full of striking images that complement a well-written, intelligent, and stirring script which goes beyond the surface and moves you to wonder about what is happening to us.

If you want to know how to direct a movie that will leave an impression for life on the individual and in the history of cinema then you will want to watch SE7EN.

29 December 2000,Wow!!,"I have never watched this film proper since a cinema outing on it's original release, I enjoyed it immensely the first time and it is a tribute to the film that it has stayed the same since 1995. In fact the time elapsed has given it a new lease of life. It has given the viewer time to digest the performance of the principals - more so with the ascendancy of three of the leading players - Kevin Spacey gives a towering but brief performance. I can't fault any aspect of the film. It is absolutely riveting, the dark tone, the disturbing content and for me personally, the end is almost perfect in these vox pop, studio needs a happy ending, audience sampling, be everything to everybody, times. I have been lucky to be the recipient of the remastered DVD and it is perfect. Watch it and be mesmerised.

21 March 2020,Amazing Thriller,"This is actually one of the best films that I have seen that I have only wanted to watch one. The reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. Like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain.

Hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. This is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. This seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of David Fincher's films. Interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions I don't want to wish upon myself.

The serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. If you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god I saw it without knowing the pay-off- although I knew there was going to be one. This is a movie after all.

Brad Pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. Here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. Morgan Freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. He is nearing retirement (in the film), but I thought all cops were about to retire in movies - I took that as read!

This is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is Se7en in longterm reflection? A horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification?

Serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but America is home to half of the world's population of them. Why is this? Maybe it is the last chance to make a mark on a society where being in the media and being in the spotlight are prized? When you have killed someone you are interesting, when you haven't you are not. Simple.",8
16 April 2020,Story about Homicides,"A film about two homicide detectives' (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) desperate hunt for a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the world's ignorance of the Seven Deadly Sins. The movie takes us from the tortured remains of one victim to the next as the sociopathic ""John Doe"" (Kevin Spacey) sermonizes to Detectives Somerset and Mills -- one sin at a time. The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and subdued tones characteristic of film noir. The seasoned and cultured but jaded Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...

18 August 2001,Excellent movie,"I am not a Brad Pitt fan , but he is excellent in Se7en. I never thought he could act so well. Once again Morgan Freeman, one of the most underrated actors ever, gives an brilliant performance. This is a must see movie.

26 September 2021,Why 8 points,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",8

19 January 2022,Review from Lissenok,"Having seen my favorite actors in this film, I wanted to watch this film, unfortunately it did not interest me as much as I would like, however, despite the plot, the film turned out to be very difficult to perceive (frankly, I had to watch it several times), but nevertheless you can put a solid ""seven"", I advise you to watch it, but only once. The film is naturally not a family film. But honestly speaking, it was not difficult to get into the atmosphere of the film itself, I would even say that in some moments I empathized for the hero and seemed to feel some situations for myself. I'm happy with the film, but still.. it could have been better. Great-Great-Great.

5 March 2022,7 for SE7EN,"90'cult that I got to see just today. What I liked most is the gloomy and gory atmosphere, hitting you hard in the face for its roughness and uncensored violence. I personally found the ending both plot twisting both unfinished. At the end I wanted more and wanted to see what are the consequences on what we witnessed in the very last scene.

11 May 2002,When it all comes together!,"As a 26 year old...I've seen virtually every American flick on the shelves over the past 20 years.

Seven is the best movie I've ever seen.....bar none.

Its quality is an example of near perfection....where every imaginable variable in the equation of modern cinema is built to virtually ideal specifications in telling the story.

Truly unique... an absolute ""must see"" if you believe in such.

29 December 2021,Dark and beautiful,"As soon as the credits roll, we understand that we are going to see a film in which particular attention will be paid to the aesthetics, the light, the photography, the atmosphere.

While writing this review, I think back to the film that I haven't seen for years. I immediately remembered a muggy, rainy atmosphere, and then I remembered that the more the film progresses the more the colors lighten up until an extremely sunny final scene.

In 1992, Basic Instinct had opened a new door on the psychological thriller, sexual with false leads. Here, with Se7en, we change paradigm to go towards pure darkness, without false pretenses.

12 June 2002,Dark and visually the best film ever!!!!!!!,"Colour and lighting, Fincher emphasizes shadows and dimly lit scenes--the kind that lend more to the tone of the shot than to the ego of the star. You'd be hard pressed to find any light situation in any of his films that truly flatters the actors. Se7en is definitely Fincher's darkest movie--in mood and in lighting. The majority of Se7en contains very little light, the crime scenes being the most notable examples. In fact, most of Se7en's lighting is directional, meaning that it comes from an artificial source focused in one direction with a low falloff. The brightness of the desert setting during the climax is a dramatic shift from the rest of the movie and is perfect for the change in tone and action of the finale. The most interesting use of colour in Se7en comes when Mills and Somerset explore John Doe's apartment. Everything is, of course, red and dark. Camera work and editing, The chase scene with Mills and Doe is about as exciting as they come. The camera moves quickly with the characters, and the odd angles keep the audience from seeing everything--building paranoia and escalating the tension. The steady movement of the SWAT team as they descend upon the sloth victim is another well-choreographed sequence. All of Fincher's films feature some kind of chase scene, which is definitely a good thing, considering how effectively he pulls them off. Production and set design, A lot of the settings are buildings in decay; many of them were built from scratch and then made to look worn. I believe that Fincher often films on sets rather than scouting out interior locations because actual interiors rarely live up to his meticulous imagination. Rotting wood, rust, water stains and peeling paint all help to make each scene totally believable--more like moody still life's than movie sets.

In the spirit of rule breaking, Fincher makes his credits ascend upwards. I'm not sure if this is the first time this has ever been done, but it's the only movie I have seen it in. Aside from scrolling up, the credits are also visually interesting. Careless lines and scratches weave in and out of text.",10
31 August 2002,One of the best movies of the last 10 years.,"It isn't often that a tired, over used genre can be livened up by a brilliantly original and well executed piece of work. Se7en is that film. This film is wonderfully dark and brilliantly written. The performances are superb and Fincher and co. have worked hard to create a movie full of suspense and tension which leaves the viewer guessing until the final frame. One of the best movies of the last 10 years. Highly recommended.

22 August 2002,Doesn't play by the rules...and that's a good thing,"This doesn't give away anything in the film, but it might hint at things

The reason when ""Seven"" (aka Se7en) should be ranked so highly is because it's a film that purely refuses to give into the Hollywood system. Firstly, it never shows you the crimes taking place, opting instead to show you the aftermath. And even then it never pushes it right into your face. It's more reliant on the audiences reaction within itself, within each individual viewer, which is far more powerful than a thousand special effects. Secondly, the ending (and not giving anything away) completely catches you off guard. It is like nothing you expected, and by obeying the rules it has already set out for itself (see above) it makes it all the more scarier. Coupled with the fact that the studio wanted to go with an alternative happy ending (for ""happy"" see conventional) and Fincher fought for his vision makes this a true rarity in cinema today.

11 April 2003,"one of the best films available, very disturbing","This was a outstanding movie! It really makes you take a closer look at your surroundings. It's strange, with most movies you just watch them and then move on to something else. But with this movie, it's disturbing because John Doe points out a lot of things that you think about and realize that they ARE true! there IS ""a deadly sin on every corner, in every home"" and we DO look past it because it IS common. Maybe the way John dealt with it wasn't that good, hell it was insane(!), but you have to admit, he makes a lot of good points!

21 June 2020,A grim masterpiece of cinema,"I have had an odd journey with this film over the past 20+ years. I first saw it in my early teens, which was probably a bit too young. I definitely did not get all the gruesome details that are left to the viewer's imagination. As I started watching more movies as I grew up, I slowly moved away from a 'just watching' to a more analytical approach, in the sense that I started to get some idea of how Fincher constructed the film and had an appreciation for the sheer technical quality of the movie. At this point, the movie was more an exercise and admiration of the film making.

Now, with my most recent re-watch, I suddenly was struck by the gut punch that the film delivers. It's like I've gone a full circle with the movie and back to a more emotional, visceral experience. It is a grim and dark film with not really a glimmer of light to speak of, but it's somehow not depressing like other films can be.

I'm sure it's highly subjective, but for me, this is simultaneously an example of pure craftsmanship and excellence in film making, and something that after all these years and numerous re-watches delivers an emotional impact. I can't really find any flaws in it. The story moves relentlessly, acting is great (some might disagree on you-know-what), pacing is great, visually stunning in all its grime, and if you see this for the first time without knowing anything about the movie, do yourself a favor and don't spoil it for yourself, just watch it. You might not like where the story takes you along the way, but very, very few films deliver this kind of experience. The darkness is supremely crafted and not just an exploitative sideshow of nastiness.",10
11 March 2010,A Stunning Thriller,"Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt star in this incredible thriller about a killer that mimics The Seven Deadly Sins through his murders.

Se7en is a fantastic, dark, and gritty thriller with many twists and a incredible climax. Morgan Freeman being one of my favourite actor's in film, delivers a fantastic performance and presents a very compelling character for the film. Although not being a fan of Brad Pitt, he still performs well in this movie and both the actors compliment each other. Freeman however, steals the spotlight for most of the movie mostly due to the character that is created and how compelling and well thought out he is.

The story does start off a little slow but it really does pick up after about twenty to thirty minutes in. It keeps you guessing on what will happen next and will keep you on the edge of the seat. The ending of the movie I feel was the best part of it all. I will not say anything about the ending but I'm sure it will shock you.

Overall, it is a fantastic movie and I would recommend it to any adult who is a fan of the thriller genre. Go see it.",9
1 April 2003,Seven was surpising and very interesting.,"A movie I saw was seven, it was Directed by David Fincher who was in charge of this bleak and Ultimately terrifyng crime thriller. This film was written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Seven was surprising and very interesting; It was set in present USA. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwynwth Paltrow were the more important characters, but Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman were detectives, whose investigated about 7 sins, the other character were very good too. I enjoyed the play very much, also I saw the movie with a lot of concentration. I recomend this film for people who are interesting in police and thriller film, is excellent, don´t forget.

5 July 2011,Just amazing...a true masterpiece,"I have seen a lot of movies in this genre, but I must say that this one tops them all.

Acting: 10/10 .... Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were awesome. They were so much in character and the way they complemented each other being two totally opposite-minded detectives was just marvelous. I never really liked Pitt much and refrained from watching his movies thinking that he is just a show-off and the one movie that I did watch of him(not this one) proved the same. But from now on, I am so gonna watch his movies. As for Freeman, his performance cannot be described.

Story: 10/10 .... An amazing thriller, superbly written. The story has been ingeniously crafted and is totally shocking, stunning and DARK. It keeps a tight grip over you and you WILL be scared of what might happen next. The whole plot startling, especially the ending.

Overall:10/10 .... Directed with complete perfection by David Fincher, it is indeed a masterpiece. The scenes are intense and remarkably dark. You don't see such movies everyday.

I seriously suggest not going through any spoilers as they will only ruin the fun for you.",10

19 June 2006,A true crime movie,"This movie is worth the watch. This movie fits in with the best movies of the 90's and then some. This came from an era of either crappy high school flicks or serious story lines that got away from the beginning. This movie ties it all together. The actors themselves are some of the best in the business. Kevin Spacey plays a phenomenal role, and can be seen in even better form in The Usual Suspects. Brad Pitt plays an outstanding role, which was characteristic for him in the mid and late 90's. Mogan Freeman plays an excellent cop, which juxtaposes him against his portrayal of Red in the Shawshank Redemption, also a notable viewing.

This movie's all-star cast is a great treat, but it does lack in some development early on in the film. Yet most will not notice it, nor will they care, as they will either be entranced or sickened, maybe both.

29 October 2004,The best movie of the 1990s to which all others should aspire.,"Seven is unique movie in very many respects. It belongs to that subset of movies that combines thriller with aspects of religion, though, without resorting to supernatural forces (Stigmata, Green Mile, etc.) which turn off many people, including me. The movie is indeed an epic-it is the epic of one person, a serial killer, who weaves together his seven murders with the seven deadly sins, such that each victim is a practitioner of the sin, hence making him/her complicit in his/her murder according to the murderer. Though the serial killer cannot be the protagonist by definition, the charisma that he commands and the legendary feat that he accomplished dispels the Foucaultian myth that ""the Man is Dead."" Just one, simple man, through ingenious plotting and scheming, creates a religiously inspired masterpiece and leaves the rest of us in ""shock and awe."" The darkness of the movie is unrivaled. I first saw in Turkey, and later many many times in Chicago, and the revealed darkness makes more sense in an American context. Since Bladerunner, I have not encountered a movie so dark and captivating nonetheless. Apart from the fabulous plot, characters contribute a lot to this success: Brad Pitt is the impatient, young, high tempered tragic hero, a role he will turn to many many years later in Troy. Morgan Freeman-the great detective as always. And Gywenth Paltrow does a great job as well. This movie is the defining movie-masterpiece of the 1990s and a must see for anyone.",10

21 March 2005,"Smart, suspenseful, and makes you think.","Should we be punished for the sins we commit? Well the bad guy in this movie believes so. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt star as veteran and novice cops trying to solve a smart, ruthless, serial killer trying to teach the world a lesson. This movie was unbelievable and I mean this in a good way. There was a bit of gore so it is not for the weak at heart but the story line was flawless. Each scene was executed brilliantly and Freeman and Pitt were at their best. At first look this movie is just a smartly written thriller but there are a lot of pieces that could go unnoticed if not looked at close enough. Give this movie your full attention. Gwyneth Paltrow also gave a sweet and believable performance and the part of the serial killer was played to perfection but it is the plot of this movie that I thought was wonderful. If you like suspense you can't afford to miss this film.

20 November 2005,One of the best movies of the modern years,"The first of its kind, and the best of its kind of movie did not let down for a minute. A movie based on the seven deadly sins was put together so well that i had to watch it 2 maybe 3 times to savor the utter joy of the movie. Today, this movie has been combined along with the ring to form a movie called saw. If seven was not made, the horror/drama business would be in such a dilemma they would be scratching their heads looking for ill-gotten answers that would have eluded them if not for this movie. I highly recommend the likings of the movie and if you are into the jump in your seat, and highly suspenseful ending movies then you are absolutely sure to love this movie. A+

25 March 2018,everything what has been said about this movie is true,"After the glorious Silence of the lambs,Hollywood came up with another hypnotic psychological thriller,seven.This time by Traumitized director David Fincher who struggled with the mess that Alien 3 resulted from the guts 20th century fox. What we witnessed through 128 minutes were some of the most disgusting images never shown but thought in our heads. A nihilistic and innescapable nightmare which represent what every crime thriller should be. It´s almost mindboggling how good this movie is. such effort was put on the editing room managing a scareful atmosphere with a correct use of a poor palette color. Brad Pitt gives the best moment in his carreer and almost makes you think he will never accomplish what he showed here. The movie ain´t perfect. It has an inconsistent pacing ,but it´s worthy due to perhaps the best Plot twist since Hitchcock´s Psycho in 1960.

6 June 2015,disappointing effort,"I could give this film credit for acting, for cinematography, character development, etc., however, the failure seems to be in the story.

It is obvious from the outset what the ""seven"" refers to in the film, however it remains to be seen if the characters or the audience will be able to figure out what this will ultimately end up leading to as it goes along. I suppose it depends on how perceptive the characters or the audience are. There is a message behind the whole thing, and I will give credit that the message gets across and that is why I will give the movie half points for that execution, but as for surprises I will give it no credit at all.

The failure of this film is in the ultimate outcome as the detectives are not smart enough themselves to figure out what the viewer of the film can see coming.

7 October 2005,"brilliant, fantastic, superb! what more can i say?","This film is superb!Not only does it have fantastic actors such as Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey but Brad Pitt manages to put aside the comments that he is only famous for his looks and not his acting ability. He plays a very convincing role and had me believing a very word that he spoke. Thye only thing that lets this film down would have to be the presence of Gwynth Paltrow. The directing, lighting and editing skills as well as the well written plot over shine the lack of talent that Paltrow brings to this film, a must see movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot contains everything you need, suspense, good action type scene's, gory footage for the horror lovers, and a fantastic twist ending. A movie that you can happily watch over and over again. One of the best films I've seen in years and highly recommended. If you liked this you will love Kiss the Girls, another fantastic movie with Morgan Freeman, a must see.

15 November 2005,a new kind of thriller,"i thought that this was and excellent movie. David Fincher does an amazing job at holding your attention with horrific but yet cultivating scenes. And the combo of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman is exhilarating i rated this movie a ten easily. The point of it is not to scare but to teach the audience that there are killers out there with the intent to kill gruesomely for the benefit of making a name for themselves. Kevin Spacey who plays the murder in this film does an amazing job. He has to get the point across to the audience that he is a highly intelligent person but at the same time also insane. This movie really gives us a first hand look at the darker more menacing side of crime mysterious.

29 January 2005,spacey in seven,"This is to Gardenwriter.

The reason Kevin Spacey's name is not in the opening credits is because he asked to be uncredited on purpose. This was to keep his character a secret, ambiguous. If people knew Spacey was in it then they would have known that he was John Doe from the very beginning. So that is why. Spacey wouldn't take the role if they had put his name in the opening credits. I think more movies should do this. It is a very smart way of not giving away everything in the movie. Gary Oldman did the same thing in Hannibal, so people would look at the character and not Gary Oldman playing the character.

22 April 2006,An aesthetic of its own,"That certain noir feel, tweaked so perfectly, keeps all the richness of noir and loses the period specific dialog that makes classic noir films often feel like cultural artifacts rather than immediately engaging stories that entertain on their own intrinsic merits. Death by sin: gluttonous guy eats too much, lustful guy sexes one too many times, and so on and so on. It's noir without being simply a movie about movies, without simply being an homage to other moviesit stands on its own, it has its own aesthetic, it's just that that aesthetic captures the spirit of luxurious mystery that is associated by film lovers with film noir. Death by sin: gluttonous guy eats too much, lustful guy sexes one too many times, and so on and so on.

I know thats a bold statement but I really think it is - I have never watched a film so many times and been able to completely lose myself it it like this film - normally the only films I can watch over and over again are comedies.

The lead acts are so good,and the action extremely clever not a film for the faint hearted though... me missus finds parts of the film disgusting (which I think makes me like the film even more) and don't go expecting a warm, fuzzy feeling at the end...be prepared!

11 January 1999,A masterpiece of the human mind.,"This is not a movie. This is not a 2 hour and some odd minutes vaunt into some fairy land where you leave the theater smiling, discussing character development and costume design.

Rather, SE7EN is dark and rainy. It shows us what our secrets look like; it exemplifies the mysteries behind what we all think but never dare whisper in even the most intimate company. Anyone intelligent enough to appreciate such images and emotions will revere SE7EN as a work of art. Only the most immature viewers, blinded by images of death and darkness, will not understand what SE7EN is. SE7EN is what life is.

16 November 1999,I found myself shocked yet totally engrossed,"David Fincher. An auteur? Judging by films such as Alien3, the Game and Fight Club you might be forgiven for thinking so but it's Se7en that really stands out. Dark, disturbing and dangerously addictive. This film has all the ingredients of a thought provoking, highly entertaining film and the tried and tested old cop/young cop plot is given a complete and refreshing overhaul.

The menacing idea behind the film is second to the none and the addition of great performances by Freeman (on top form as the old cop) and Pitt (proving he can act) only add to the overall quality.

Includes one of the most memorable scenes in film this decade where John Doe utters the words, ""Detective. Detective. DETECTIVE""!

Prepare yourself though, for the ending that ultimately leaves a very long lasting impression on you. The twist will throw you so far off course it will take several viewings for it all to sink in.

This is how films should be made. David Fincher is a directing hero. Freeman and Pitt are perfect in their roles. Se7en is a landmark for detective thrillers. Watch it!",9
3 December 1999,Well worth a few hours of your time,"This film is perhaps one of the most intriguing, thought-provoking movies in a long while. The style by which David Fincher presents this movie is perhaps comparable to the late Alfred Hitchcock, an achievement not easily gained. Morgan Freeman delivers a stellar performance as a police officer on the brink of retirement only to be pulled back into the life he is trying to escape by a psychopathic maniac. Brad Pitt brings to the screen the mentality of a rookie cop dead-set on solving the case that just happened to fall in his lap. Pitt somewhat lacks in experience compared to Freeman and it is evident in the movie, but hats off to his attempt to keep on the same playing field as Freeman. I believe that David Fincher wanted the identity of the murderer to remain concealed, otherwise this person would have been listed in the opening credits and on the movie poster, so I will end on that note. This movie is well worth $20 to own, let alone worth a few hour of your time. A must see.

9 October 2000,"bleak, excellent serial killer drama","Brad Pitt in the performance of his career is excellent as a detective teamed with Morgan Freeman, both men at opposite ends of there lives. This is a chilling and graphic thriller with as much style as substance. The killer, when revealed is very surprising, though you have probably seen it. David Fincher brings gritty realism to the tale of an intelligent maniac basing horrific killings on the seven deadly sins. A smart screenplay and surprising in-sight on humanity and our downward spiral makes for a thoroughly involving and bleak motion picture. You can't find a film like it.

28 November 2000,Playing on our own apathy?,"Seven was vaguely entertaining and fabulously well filmed, but marred by a general lack of character development. While the film does well to create an oppressive aura over the unnamed city, I found that I really couldn't care less about the characters, which upon first viewing I saw as a major fault.

On the second viewing, I felt a little more kindly toward the movie. As one of the major themes of the story and the primary motivation of John Doe's killings is the apathy of modern society -that no one cares about anyone else- I wondered if David Fincher was trying to trick us into feeling the same way?

Was I deliberately not supposed to feel for the characters, in order to have some 'feeling' (albeit through a strange agent) shocked into me at the end? I'm not sure. Fincher has proved himself an excellent, intelligent filmmaker, but I'm still unsure of whether to offer him the benefit of the doubt in the case of Seven.

6/10.",
4 January 2001,Special Edition Version (DVD): Se7enth Heaven.,"This movie's title sequence alone has changed the film and television mediums forever. Even if you aren't a film buff, you will immediately recognize this after seeing this beautifully creepy, acid-washed and frantic collage of images. Fincher's stylistic use of framing, lighting, and choice of cinematographer creates a mood that sinks like a brick to the pit of your stomach.

If I were to choose a genre movie that could definetley top Johnathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"", this would be the one. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwenyth Paltrow are dead-on portraying each of their characters; respectively: a detective who has requested a transfer to the non-specific city's seedier side, a veteran detective who is set to retire in seven days, and a wife who is entirely reluctant about moving to this inner-city. The events which unfold, wrap these characters into a series of situations where no viewer will guess the horrifying ending until it is fully set in motion.

Spacey alone deserves a separate paragraph. If you thought Hannibal was devious and witty (and he is), check out Mr. Spacey as John Doe. His subtle portrayal is in contrast to Mr. Hopkin's over-the-top, almost campy Hannibal Lector. Kevin Spacey sets the ""creep-factor"" to 10 in his vision of a truly sadistic serial killer.

Do yourself a favor, even if you aren't a noir or horror fan. See this movie, because there are a myriad of reasons to appreciate what Fincher has created. If you think you won't get into the story because this, at first glance, appears to be a glorified horror movie, you will be cheating yourself out an incredible film experience.",10

From the beginning with the very interesting opening credit scene, to the very end, with John Doe and the detectives. What makes this film so good, is not only the story, which really gets you thinking, but the way it was filmed. Some of the coolest camera angles, cinematograpic effects, etc! Well, this is just a cool movie... and David Fincher is really good with dvd's. He truly understands sound, picture and overall enjoyment of a movie. Fight Club had a great dvd, and now that the Se7en is released on dvd... we can all be in our happy little basements... enjoying it.

8 December 2019,The most thought-provoking and gripping fiction of ancients,"I had really liked this movie before I watched it beacuse of its forceful cast. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt who are the most famous actors in the world are taking part together. Therefore, in my opinion, there shouldn't be any prejudice about movie in your mind.

It was a masterpiece of ancient movie fictions owing to its well-written, gripping, disturbing and intresting scenario. The movie is about metaphorically seven sins, two detective and a serial killer. The seven sins are explained as people's common behaviors such as being greedy and being arrogant . In the scenerio, The murder kills people and leaves traces behind himself about those ''seven sins'' before he leaves from each homicide areas. Then detectives start to follow the case.

From my perspective, the director of this movie confronts us with our own common behaviours and enforces us to think which kind of ''sin'' we generally have. Therefore, movie's main theme was processed well and ideas were completely understandable. Other than, It had extraordinary crime scenes and fascinating dialogues between two detectives so nothing was boring.",10

13 April 2001,Great Ending.,"This movie has one of the more original endings I've seen in years. Not to spoil it, but it's an unexpected twist to a gruesome, yet intriguing. Great movie to watch by yourself at 2 AM, though you might not want to sleep afterwards. It's one of those movies you can't watch and not think about it afterwards.

31 July 2006,Excellent movie... Brad Pitt overrated,"I loved Se7en. Engrossing, mysterious plot that you can read about in other reviews. It's been said enough how excellent this movie is, but I don't remember reading anything about Brad Pitt's performance being overrated so I figured I'd share my thoughts. Having seen Fight Club before watching any earlier Pitt movies, I was mostly disappointed with Brad's performances (except for a few). His casual conversations and such in Se7en seemed unique to Pitt (a couple of head scratches, looking around a lot, very confident dialogue, etc.), but the emotionally intense scenes (especially the final scene), which are extremely important, seemed very awkward and unrealistic given the circumstances of the plot's brutal context. My opinion of Brad Pitt's less than desirable performance in Se7en didn't ruin the movie for me, but without the awkwardness delivered in those crucial emotional scenes, this movie would be a flawless film.

24 May 2001,Masterful,"Se7en is a chilling, concise, psychological thriller. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt)are two detectives trying to track down a serial killer. The movie's simplicity is what makes it so great. There are some wonderful contrasts made between the characters and settings throughout this movie that add to film's mystique. The detectives encounter a variety of interesting, colorful characters that go well with the shocking nature of the different killings that occur.

If you haven't seen this film, the ending will leave you speechless.

Be sure to check out the DVD platinum edition that contains several special features including two full-lenght commentaries with the stars and producers.

One of the best. *****

28 April 2020,Se7en has to be considered one of the best horror and suspense movies ever,"Seven is a movie starring for Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, a couple of geniuses of the acting in the shoes of the investigators William Sommerset and David Mills, respectively. The movie is classified as a suspense movie, because it unfolds through around to a serie of crimes which started to committed by a serial killer without any cause, however, each of one of the victims were represented by each of one of the seven deadly sins, reminder how we know that seven sins are the causes of any other perversions of the human, according to the Christian religión. The movie also is acclaimed because it takes us for many possible emotions from some smiles to the frightening, the astonishing and more than anything to the reflexión about what it's wrong and what it's well, according the viewpoint and what it implies the consequences of a lot of the human behaviors.

The film could be leave nuisance, because isn't the casual end of a crime movie where always the good guy wins and the bad guy lost or where the good guy is who leave the reflexión. Also, the movie is too chritic and we make us think in the true repentance for the wrong done or just an contrition act, where the regret is not for loving god but it's for what the person can lost. Another part about the movie is about the murderer, a methodic and specially patiance man, who has most the planned things and he knows that even in the end of their lifes, the humans ever ends falling into the life's perversions. For least like extra point about the movie, the setting of the scenes (like the weather and the light in closed areas), the photography and the make up complete all the whole of mistery, misery and darkness what distinguish this amazing movie.",9
12 May 2001,"a classic of the horror, thriller genre","this movie easily ranks in my top 10 of all time. for one thing, the cast was brillant. Brad Pitt did a wonderful job as the young, eneregic cop thats hot on the trail of the killer. Morgan freeman also gave a strong performance as the ""wise old owl"" cop so to say. gwyneth paltrow also had a strong preformance in the limited screen time. kevin spacey was the key to this film. very seldom does spacey not speak a line that is well thought out and has meaning to it. he makes you feel his character. the question through the movie is whether John doe, the killer, is insane or if he's a normal guy like you and me. at one point david mills (Brad Pitt) asks John doe, "" do you wake up in the morning and say, wow its amazing how f***in crazy i really am"" to which Doe answers, ""it makes you feel comfortable to label me as crazy, doesnt it"" and mills replies with a simple, "" yes very comfortable"". i thought this was a brillant scene as you makes you think that maybe this killer isnt insane, maybe he just wants to prove a point. he could be as normal as you and me but he believes in something so strongly that he's willing to kill and be killed for others to ""see"" it. i also thought this movie had ties to 8 millimeter. in 8 millimeter the killer or killers were normal people, they killed because they liked it and because they could. i think is kind of the same thing in seven. although John doe proclaims he's a ""chosen one"" and he does not want to kill, he proclaims he is not insane, no one molested him as a child, no one abused him. overall this is just a brillant film. the mood set in this film is perfect. almost every scene involves rain which leaves a dark, depressing mood which is perfect for the plot. the murders are detailed and well thought out. i would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror and others who want to see a true bred classic.",
9 May 2020,Dark,"This movie is very dark, both in its image and story. The classic story of the serial killer is associated with biblical texts to make a entertaining and new kind of movie. I thought every actor was perfectly where they should have been, Kevin Beacon is remarkable, as well as Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. They compensate each other's defiances and the harmony flows very well. The storyline is great for a night alone or with some friends, and will definitely float around in your head for days. I recommend this movie for its dark and rich atmosphere.

27 May 2001,"Not scary, no thrill, no suspense...otherwise good.","I did not see this movie until recently. I had seen Fight Club on DVD, and decided that Se7en may be worth my time, especially, because friends had seen it while it was in theatres, and they were disturbed and agitated by it. While there is nothing really terrible about the movie, it did not excite or move me. I got neither the superficial thrill or the profound revelation that I like to get from movies. The problem for me was my ability to predict how the movie would end, particularly, since I am usually very poor at this.

2 December 2021,The growing number,"We examine the growing number of studies of survey respondents' global self-ratings of health as predictors of mortality in longitudinal studies of representative community samples. Twenty-seven studies in U. S. and international journals show impressively consistent findings. Global self-rated health is an independent predictor of mortality in nearly all of the studies, despite the inclusion of numerous specific health status indicators and other relevant covariates known to predict mortality. We summarize and review these studies, consider various interpretations which could account for the association, and suggest several approaches to the next stage of research in this field.

He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face.

12 February 2002,Over The Top DVD Masterpeice,"I wont bore you with ANOTHER summary (why do amateur film reviewers feel the need to summarize the whole damn movie?) but i WILL say that Se7en is one of the top thrillers I have ever viewed with and incredible crescendo of intensity that builds to a climax that literally had me digging my fingers into my legs and freaking out. And I am usually THAT GUY who can guess the entire plot of a flick after the first 3 minutes. Or at least think I can.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are GREAT as the two detectives on the hunt for (and seemingly always three steps behind) a serial murderer and their performances really defy the cookie cutter ""he's the grizzled veteran with one month to go and he's the young triggerhappy punk cop"" roles. Great dialogue and compellingly gruesome yet clever and....intelligent evil going on.

Between Fight Club and Se7en, David Fincher has really put a dent in my top 20 alltime fave flicks and I give it my top rating.

ASIDE: Here's a DVD that really gives you some juicy extra features...storyboards, alternate endings with director's commentary, etc. I cant WAIT to watch it tonight with the Pitt, Freeman, and Fincher commentary...

17 January 2002,The most original movie in years.,"The title of the film 'Seven' is very exact and dominating in the telling of its story. Seven murders take place in the time of seven days, each death based on one of the seven deadly sins. The climax to the film also takes place at 7.07am. So the film cleverly bases its structure on the film's title. The film is in the genre of a neo-noir thriller. It gains its category through the dark techniques used throughout the movie. The deliberately dark and shabby lighting is to express how corrupt and depressing city life is. The fact the city is anonymous could prompt many people to name it themselves, New York, Los Angeles its left up to the viewer, or perhaps the movie is saying many cities are like this around the world. The film goes totally against the thriller cliche. The film throws away the modern day thriller rule book and makes its own rules where the good guy doesn't always win and the bad guy doesn't necessarily get caught. In Seven, John Doe is the killer, a bland, ordinary looking guy, with a bland ordinary name, but thats the point, murderers aren't necessarily monsters they're just everyday people like you and me. The idea of the movie is that in a world this corrupt, anyone is capable of murder and sin. This film does more than just give the usual tale of police chasing killer, it gives a film makers representation of modern living, and shows all the possible evils lurking inside it.",10

They work together to find a serial killer who has been using the seven deadly sins to commit his crimes. Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), Mills' wife, is very depressed and fears for his life.

12 January 2023,The Best Thriller I've Ever Seen,"I recently watched the movie Se7en and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The film is directed by David Fincher and it is a crime thriller that follows two detectives as they attempt to track down a serial killer who only kills on the seventh day of each month.

The story is gripping from the very beginning, with the film's opening sequence drawing you in and setting the tone for the rest of the movie. The pacing is spot on, with the tension building up throughout the film, leading to an intense and satisfying climax.

The performances in the movie were outstanding, with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt delivering powerful and nuanced performances as the two detectives. Their chemistry on screen was great, and their interactions were the highlights of the film.

The film's cinematography was also noteworthy. The use of color and lighting was stunning, creating a sense of unease and tension that perfectly matched the tone of the movie. The film's score was also great, adding to the tension and atmosphere of the film.

Overall, Se7en is a masterfully crafted crime thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The story is gripping, the performances are outstanding, and the film's technical aspects are top-notch. I highly recommend this film to fans of the genre, and I believe it will be remembered as a classic in the years to come.",10
21 February 2002,Direction,"I loved the way Fincher directed this film. The way he portrayed the theme of ""normalcy"" for Morgan Freeman's character is astonishing. Using simple camera angles and making it easy for the eye to follow. That also enhanced the shock factor of what was going to happen.

The writing, set design, and cinematography are greatly executed. The set design and makeup have such a grueling aspect to it where its repulsing but you can't take your eyes away. Especially around that time 1995 the makeup effects are very impressive and disgusting! To the writers- you made the villain to be so twisted yet get the audience to some how ,SOMEWHAT, empathize with him even though he's so sick...or maybe its just me. This film will constantly be a source of inspiration for my own work. ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

27 July 2023,increasingly,"The film seems to be just showing the world that human nature has fallen and guilty people will be punished. This kind of film has a moral admonition and a sense of warning, which may make people reflect on whether they are guilty after watching it. However, the film does not seem to provide a clear explanation for what causes these people to commit crimes and make the perpetrators unbearable and punish them through killing in the name of God. Is it because of a lack of faith? In the West, the Enlightenment discovered reason, and from then on, reason was gradually pushed to its supreme position. People's self-awareness continued to expand, fully affirming human reason and beginning to despise God. In modern times, rationality centered around science and technology has destroyed the spirit of religious beliefs, and humans who believe that science and technology are omnipotent believe that rationality can achieve everything. It is true that rationality, represented by science, has indeed driven the rapid progress of Western society and facilitated its modernization process. However, rationality has increasingly become a shackle that binds people to themselves. According to Zimmer's view, the development of society increasingly relies on ""rationalizations"" such as efficiency, computation, and punctuality. Such rationalizations are actually a form of ""materialization"", where money and commercial value become the only yardstick for measuring all values, and relationships between people become increasingly indifferent due to the power of money.",9

I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

29 April 2002,Best film ever.,"This movie is the reason that I want to be a filmmaker when I am older. David Fincher is a genius with a beautiful style. He can turn the most disgusting images into art with ambiant lighting, wonderful camera movement, and just amazing direction. Fincher is God.

3 July 2002,Best Film of the 90's,"I would have to pick Se7en as my favourite film of the 90's. Although very dark and morbid to pick as a favourite film, I choose it as it sums up everything I love about cinema. The script is outstanding from character development to the boldest movie ending in film history. I remember the first time I saw Se7en at the cinema, it was just before the buzz of the plot began to get around. Sitting there enthralled by the opening title sequence, realising this wasnt the usual hollywood fair. It is the ending that will always stick with me though, never before of since have I seen a British audience react in total astonishment to what they had just seen as they walked out of the cinema. Everyone was stunned, including myself. This is what I love about cinema, a series of pictures and sounds on a screen that can reveal all sorts of emotions in people, fantastic.

4 July 2003,"good, but......","This was a good movie with an extremely hot star. It had a good plot line and it was so real it made you feel like you were actually there in the movie with the detectives, trying to crack the case. However, there were many holes in the script like, was Somerset obsessive compulsive or just meticulous, or why did Mills ask to be transferred to that precinct? All in all, I'd say it is a movie worth seeing but you'll definitely be asking questions after it's over.

13 October 2003,... worths fighting for ...,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

2 February 2004,There's only one David Fincher,"How does he manage it?

David Fincher really is the master director of the century. His complete disregard for anything soft is admirable. The chiaroscuro lighting he employs, the choice of Kevin Spacey as John Doe. Oh, magnificent.

But, then again he does this with all his films. See Fight Club and Meat Loaf is Robert Poulson, Micheal Douglas is Nicholas Van Orten in the game. Has David Fincher ever done anything that can not be argued to be a combo of thriller and film noir?

The scenes have become famous. The ending was just a brainwave, although I preferred the unshot ending. I know, shoot me. Countless crime films now use the Se7en inspired opening sequence template. If you haven't already done so, you need to go and see it!

29 October 2002,"Dramatic, dark, brilliant, and so much more...","""Se7en"" is without a doubt David Fincher's best work. Sure, he also directed ""Fight Club"" and ""The Game"", both of which were excellent, but I believe this is Fincher at his best. While ""Se7en"" didn't have the en masse popularity and impact that Fight Club had, it was just as raw, just as real, and just as entertaining.

Although it has many upsides, there are several downsides. Number one being that throughout the movie there is quite a bit of gore, but Fincher apparently thought the audience would lose their stomach at the end, and kept what was possibly the most impactful 'gore' scene hidden, and left it to the imagination of the viewer.

Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman played off of each other remarkably well, considering how different they, and their characters Mills & Somerset, are. Freeman put on the excellent performance that everyone knows he's capable of, and Pitt was just as good. Kevin Spacey was perfectly cast as ""John Doe"" because he, quite frankly, creeped me out. Moreso even then Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal Lecter"" in ""The Silence of The Lambs"".

The best element of the movie, however, was Fincher's extraordinary use of the world around the characters. The raw colors, the amazing sound, and the non-main characters all made the movie feel as if it was real, and made it that much darker when the ""climax"" occured.

All in all, ""Se7en"" is, in my opinion, the best serial-killer based movie since ""The Silence of The Lambs"". Definitely one for any fan of dark mysteries to see, if they can stomach it.",

31 January 2014,Probably shouldn't have watched this after Dexter,"I feel like watching the show Breaking Bad ruined the show Weeds for me. I think I had the same problem with Se7en after finishing the show Dexter. The plot twists and murders in that Dexter are just so much more gruesome and interesting than the ones depicted in Se7en that I just wasn't surprised by the ending. I could pretty much predict what was going to happen during the entire movie after watching 96 episodes about a serial killer.

I'm sure it was a great movie back in 1995 and had I originally watched it back than I would probably be giving this a 9/10. However in 2014 there have been so many crime drama shows/movies that Se7en just seemed mediocre to me. I found it a little slow until the end and even that part was not utterly shocking to me.

21 April 2019,One of the best thrillers out there!,"This movie is perfectly crafted and told with so much suspense - definitely a must-see! Written by Andrew Kevin Walker - shot by Darius Khondji - Se7en is masterpiece starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and not to forget Kevin Spacey (giving one of his best performances). Although it's shot in Los Angeles you never really get a glimpse of the city and surroundings. One of my favourites without a doubt!

I would say well since I am going to die anyways just pull the trigger man, cause there is no way in Hell im gonna chop of my own stomach! And then if he just decided to slice it of himself! I would kick him in the face, Kevin Spacey is a pretty small guy I think I could take him... Just a thought!

7 April 2010,The best thriller,"The movie ""Seven"" is very certainly the best thriller I have ever seen. In addition of an excellent casting composed of two of the best actors of Hollywood, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, this film has an excellent script. Indeed, even if in the beginning it seems to be very classic with a young and inexperienced detective and an other one who is old and about to retire himself, it is rather different from the other films of this genre since the acts of the murderer are based on the seven deadly sins, which make his murders sadistic and spectacular. Which impressed me the most is the atmosphere which is dark and oppressive, the scenes are poorly enlightened, it rains almost the movie, the murders are violent and bloody.

21 August 2010,"Perfect Writing, Directing, Acting","Andrew Kevin Walker wrote what could be considered one of the greatest scripts in cinema history and it was undoubtedly adapted with perfect precision by the great auteur David Fincher. The cinematography is also dynamic and gritty, a characteristic found in many Fincher films such as Fight Club.

Easily, the best performance goes to Kevin Spacey. He was the best actor within the group. But I would point to Andrew Kevin Walker again, as he created and actor proof character, but Spacey delivered. If the character himself had had more screen time, I think he would have been just as, if not more interesting to watch than Anthony Hopkins Hannibal.

I've read that Pitt turned down a role in Apollo 13 to do this and a brilliant choice it was. He has since worked with Fincher on Fight Club and The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, so they must work well together, either way it comes across well on screen.",9
30 June 2017,"Arguably the best Crime Thriller ever, certainly of the 90's.","David Fincher's Se7en is arguably the best crime thriller ever and certainly of the 90's. A meandering investigative story we follow two detectives, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, through their trials to catch a serial killer with a message.

This film really captures the gritty and dirty side of our current culture, exploring an incredibly intelligent, intense and well thought out series of murders.

Se7en, shot by Darius Khondji ASC, is a modern cinematic masterpiece with cinematography that is compelling and tireless.

The story keeps you excited and wanting more, a thoroughly intense 2 hours which you will be going back for more even though the grim subject and imagery. This film is a must watch, one that deserves it't place in the best films of all time.

12 July 2003,"""Become Wrath""","""Se7en"" is a sinister, bleak and disturbing look at the evil which breathes under the city. It goes without questioning that Se7en is absolutely flawless, a perfect film in every single aspect. The beautiful cinematography, tight editing, moody direction and the strong acting abilities from Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey.

Some of the murders based on the Seven Deadly Sins are quite gruesome and not for the faint hearted. They don't hold back on showing us the skinny here, folks! The most impressive and memorable part of the film has to be the ending, which is one of the greatest endings ever. It trails along oodles of tension and a very well done conversation in the police car involving Pitt, Freeman and John Doe. It will certainly leave you shocked in your seat.

It also has to be said that John Doe, the man responsible for the murders, will go down as one of the greatest villans in film history... Ta-ta indeed, Hannibal Lecter. The film itself should also go down in film history as the second greatest thriller, taking a seat right behind The Silence of the Lambs.",10
22 June 2020,Great film!,"One of the best films ever made! Great story and script with the best director ever, David Fincher. I really like the characters. Morgan Freeman does his best work and makes a great cop. Brad Pitt does his second best performance after Meet Joe Black. Paltrows interpretation of the inocent young wife is also very good.

28 September 2003,Greatest most gripping crime movie ever...,"It starts out with a single gruesome murder which then leads to a series of murders all pointing to a psychotic killer that keeps the cops always one step behind. The murderer is trying to leave a lasting impression to the world by making examples of those who have broken the 7 deadly sins, it is up to Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt to end the crimes before he gets to number 7. The intelligent writing and amazing acting create the most memorable crime movie ever. Morgan Freeman is brilliant, and Brad Pitt fits easily into the hot new rookie cop role. With a battle of personalities to go along with the diabolical criminal mind commiting the murders, the movie keeps you guessing and surprised with each twist and turn. The most chilling scene of the entire movie is the end sequence that will surprise and shock every viewer. A must see for any movie fan, just make sure you have the stomach to handle the very gruesome scenes.

28 June 2011,Testimony of the golden years of the 90's,"One of the reasons why 90's cinema is still the greatest. If you like drama movies with suspense in it, this is the one you should watch. It is disturbing to see how the mind of a psychopath is portrayed in the movie. It is an outstanding thriller with no plot holes. Kevin Spacey could be considered a different version of Hannibal Lecter. This movie is entertaining to watch, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are top notch as usual. The story is frightening, tense and exciting. You really feel for the characters and their drama. I have the blue ray of it and the image quality is fantastic. I recommend anyone to watch the Blu ray version! End of my review.

Then I stumbled on a masterpiece dubbed ""Se7en"" I read the back of it and it seemed like I would like the topic and genre. I watched the night I bought it and let's just say, that this is the first movie I rewound and watched again.

But, upon watching it, I realized that this is a movie which is highly overrated but seem to be not up to expectation. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman played their part genuinely though the intensity of the serial crime happened in the movie was not catchy and influential. I take this movie is far away from reality! At times the movie seemed to be boring and may cause eye lids to fall down. I never watched a crime story with least thrilling vibe'. The justification seen behind each murders sounded childish. I don;t suggest you to watch this movie rather can be used a sleeping pills!

29 April 2006,"£3.99 DVD from virgin, its a disgrace...","I brought this film from virgin mega-stores not to long ago, for £3.99... I had heard that it was a classic horror/thriller of the 90's so i brought it. I went home and watched it that night to find one of the best movies I have ever seen. you should go out and buy it for a lot more than that,(but don't because you know that the second you do you'll turn around and see it for cheaper and then hate yourself for being impatient.)

I had also heard that it was gratuitously gory and violent, upon watching the film i was pleasantly surprised. In my opinion violence can be used to great effect, and also ,in my experience, films that have been certified '18' because of their violence are often over the top and unnecessary. For example 'Kill Bill' although I found it entertaining (to a point) you start to think that no character in the films life is important because they are being disembowelled left, right and centre, and as soon as you take that away, you take away the reality of it, because in real life every life matters and you cannot just chop through 88 people with a samurai sword. So i thought that this may perhaps be the case for Seven. I was, however, wrong. at points David Fincher used extreme violence but it works well and makes the audience root even more for Mills(Pitt) and Somerset(Freeman) because you want them to solve the crime and be done with this disgusting world (Morgan Freeman is retiring after the case, and Brad Pitt's wife wants to go back to the city they recently moved from).

Another great thing about Seven is that not only does it thrill and disturb but it also makes you question the world that we live in. The film is set in the modern day, but in no particular place. It is a dark and grim city filled with crime and corruption, and it makes the audience really think about crime, helped along by Morgan Freemen who often talks about whether or not crime will stop, or will it go on for ever and why.

The acting is brilliant, the contrast between Mills and Somerset, Somerset being the old, experienced cop on the verge of retirement and Mills, the hot-headed rookie. One of my favourite parts is when Morgan Freeman tells Pitt he should read up on the crimes, and gives him a list of books to get. Later we see a policeman handing the revision notes versions of the books (including 'Dante's Inferno') to Pitt. Kevin Spacy plays 'the bad guy' fantastically, a calm slimy, religious fanatic, who's voice makes you want to turn the TV off and stop watching. The end sequence is very emotional and the tension is increased by a ten minute long car journey with the two heroes in front and Kevin Spacy in the back cleverly named John Doe, the police slang for an unidentified body.

This is an amazing film, scary, tense thought provoking and even funny at times, definitely a classic, and if you have £3.99 i know what i'd spend it on...",10
22 November 2018,Masterpiece,"I love this movie. It's the movie of my life. It fits everything perfectly: argument; characters, interpretations; scenery, photography; Assembly; realization and that end ... Se7en is one of the best of its kind and the greatest exponent of the 90's. Great business card of the always competent David Fincher. Spend the years to pass, it will always be a current movie. TIMELESS.

4 February 2005,Finest Thriller for Years.,"I first saw Se7en on video and I loved it now I own the DVD and cannot get enough of it. All the performances are superb, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey (probably his best role other then The Usual Suspects) and Brad Pitt who Director David Fincher seems to bring the best out in. I done a paper on this film in my Media Studies and the amount of ways the camera plays with the audience and the complex narrative are also stars of this film. The opening sequence really draws in the audience. This may be David Fincher's best film as it is more complex then Fight Club and is truly a modern masterpiece. Deserves its place in the 250 This is one thriller that deserves repeat viewing and entertains every time.

2 October 2004,this is a true horror film,"I've seen many horror films. This was the first horror film that I could say I truly say it presented true horror. The ugly awful horror that you may feel and experience from a really bad recurring nightmare that makes you fear going to sleep. Or the hopeless, despairing, painful horror you may feel as you witness the death of multiple innocents, like watching the Twin Towers collapsing on 9-11 on live TV. This film while done as a detective story grabs the viewer and thrusts them into what I can only describe as a travelogue through several layers of hell.

Other horror films may try to scare you(Jaws), shock you(Psycho), gross you out(The Fly), or use any number of ways to make you afraid. This is the first movie that made me feel true horror. Not just fear, but that sense of dread and despair that haunts your memories and makes you desperately wish it never happened.

The climatic scene, the opening of the box, is one of the strongest scenes of fictional horror put to film. And if fear and horror is one of the strongest human emotions, then this is one of the most memorable films ever made.",9

This is dark at its finest but will also keep your mind hanging in the air questioning how sinister life can be.

Without giving anything away...the ending has to be credited with wrapping up one of the best written movies I have ever seen. If you haven't seen it....see it! It's that good. Detective Mills and Somerset are burdened with trying to solve homicides that have all the indications of being a Serial Killer using biblical references of the Seven Deadly Sins to commit his crimes. This movie makes you think...both about the killer, the detectives and society. If this movie was based on real murders.....they would be studied to no end and written about in Legal textbooks continually.

Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",
14 March 2005,The best film ever by far,"The best film ever by far. every time I see it I discover something new, something I hadn't realized before. Neat, just perfect. I can't find a flaw. Great actors (not so sure about Miss Paltrow) and performances. See how the characters are deeply affected by the murders, haw they change and how the weather is even relevant to the plot. The aesthetics of each scene convey the overall mood in the film. The use of light and shadows, I know it has been thoroughly calculated. The final message about sin -figure it out by yourself! The director is fabulous and you prove it again when you see Fight club - but that's another movie

24 September 2017,amazing,"so much amazing i love the ending of this great movie The film's screenplay was influenced by the time Walker spent in New York City trying to make it as a writer. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles, with the last scene filmed near Lancaster, California. The film's budget was US$33 million.

Released on September 22, 1995 by New Line Cinema, Seven went on to become the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year, grossing over $327 million worldwide.[2] It was well received by critics, who praised the darkness and brutality of the film and its themes. The film was nominated for Best Film Editing at the 68th Academy Awards, but lost out to Apollo 13.

17 July 2006,David Fincher's Magnum Opus,"I take a very middle-of-the-road stance on this movie, despite the high rating. To me, those who call it genius, unprecedented, etc. are misunderstanding it just as much as those who think of it as lowbrow horror and violence (which makes no sense by the way, as there is almost no violence shown the entire movie, part of what makes it more effective). The goal as I see it was to take the detective genre and turn it inside-out. Use every convention they could and somehow make it original while mixing in the pessimism and cynicism Fincher is deservedly famous for. Thus, by definition it can't be ""unprecedented."" But to me, doing one simple thing nearly perfect is a great deal more satisfying than trying to do something genius badly. One of the best films since its release by far, and I'm sorry but Fight Club just can't match it. To see the work of the most talented directors of our generation, look no further.

The casting was done well. Gwyneth had a very small role was hoping to see more of her. Morgan was superb and Brad was his usual self. Kevin spacey was the surprise package.

30 July 2022,On your toes,"I rewatched this movie after a long time. And out of all the gazillions of movies I have rewatched, Se7en is probably the finest. The suspense is almost laughable how much it makes sense, but when it hits you its like a crescendo to a grand opera, its like that Missile that you see coming towards you and you cannot do nothing about it. Everything comes full circle, the characters, the side characters, the interpersonal relationships, the faces, the traumas. Brad Pitt proves here that he is more than a Pretty face and a damn fine actor. Morgan Freeman is the voice of reason. And last but not the least, Spacey is THE perfect casting. Even if the movie has probably been spoiled for the most of you, it still has the redeeming value in second watching unlike Spacey's other Suspense ( see Usual Suspects ). Seven is one of the greatest movies of all time. And certainly a standout among crime thrillers. It is dark, brooding, has no levity, demands attention and is unmistakably David Fincher. This is his Dark Side of the Moon. A Bonafide Masterpiece.

18 November 2015,Worst movie i ever watched,"This is really worst movie i ever watched because you will just get sick from it and you wont be surprised or even happy because you watched it . Trust me i don't even know how these people wrote so much good reviews. Only explanation is that they like bad movies, but hey you don't argue about someones taste but really... This is ... I don't know. Basically you follow the story and you expect something to happen but. Little action, little detective knowledge and that's it . At the end of the movie i was sure that can't be the end and so, when i saw credits i was so sad. Ending is so simple and so bad, so lets be honest, what is movie with bad end ? It should leave you with some impressions, not to go in bad with empty head. When i watched movie ""Inception"" it was pure masterpiece and the end was so head blowing that i could not stop thinking about it for two more days. Now that's movie. Cheers.

26 December 2022,Exciting till the last minute!,"From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition.",9
16 January 2019,The best of all time,"The best movie ever , I have never watched movie like this , david proved that he is a genius , and undoubtedly brad pitt an morgan freeman did the best preformance of each one career , and sure we dont forget kevin spacey (THE JHON DOE ) .

17 August 2017,Masterpiece,"I gave this film a 9 because no film is perfect. I am an actor so I often study other actors works in various stages of their careers.

To the best of my knowledge, Brad Pitt was not originally cast in his role but was very hungry to break out as a star and thus tried very hard in this role. I love his demeanor as contrasted against Morgan freeman's character.

I recommend this film for any young actor who wants to see how working together closely with another actor builds BOTH actors' skill-sets.

Brad Pitt had a tendency to ""over-act"" early in his career, but not here. The film is somewhat dark but that just adds to the element of the plot.

All in all, I'd say it's a great film for a date night, or even for a small group of friends watching on a projector in the backyard on a warm summer night.",9
11 April 2023,Awsome!!,"I thanks have the chance of watch this movie for the first time now in 2023, i surprise myself with this well developed and created story. How could somoeone give less than 10 stars? I dont know. Thi briliant final, the way the things happened, the virtudes and sins represented in the moovie, this first one (virtudes) you need to pay atention on Morgan Freeman character and searching what is the virtudes that oposing the seven sins. Each fact in the moovie isnt that by the way, each fact has a motive to was there, i only can classificate this moovie as masterpiece, when i was a kid i saw some scenes of this moovie the horror scenes and dont had courage of whatc but today with 25 years old i thanks for can watch.

28 May 2020,"Very Interesting Premise, But Lacked Forethought","The Seven Deadly Sins. How amazing would it be to portray them as individuals. The movie revolves around finding the murderer who seeks to act as a messenger of God, by killing individuals who have sinned. The first few that are killed clearly exemplify these ""sinners"", but the movie failed to demonstrate the impact of the message that the murderer was creating as they tried to make the murders circle all the way back in a kind of desperate manner.

12 May 2021,A thrill through and through,"Very rarely does a film maintain a sense of dread and suspense throughout a movie. Se7en does an amazing job at pacing the movie to fit the anticipation levels of the viewer (me). This was further enhanced by the great performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and the main antagonist (no spoilers).

One of the most memorable psychological-thrillers to date and one every movie of the genre should aim to be. Within this genre I would give it a 10/10.

7 March 2019,An amazing mystery film that will keep you entralled and disturbed to the very end.,"A major issue with watching lots of horror and dark mystery films is that disturbing imagery tends to lose its effect on you. All the blood and gore just stops being disturbing because you've learned how to look at it and see nothing more than CGI or some cheesy effects. What's amazing about Se7en though is its ability to get around that.

This movie is disturbing. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but what I can say is that is shows just enough of the antagonist's murders that you're able to understand the horror of each death. And while what you see is uncomfortable and disgusting, it's nothing compared to what you don't see. The parts of the corpses the movie either jumps-cuts around, or just flat out doesn't show, are the most brutal sections. And since you never see them in great detail, all you're left with is whatever your mind creates to fill in the blanks.

The grizzly murders aren't what make the movie though, as acting is a big part of it too. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman make for an amazing pair, pulling off their contrasting character brilliantly. While the ""genius detective who wants to leave the force"" and the ""guided by his emotions"" characters aren't anything new, they're pulled off so well you'll fall in love with them both very quickly.

And then we have the plot of the film. The story follows detective Mills and Somerset as they track down a killer who is replicating the Seven Deadly Sins through their murders. While most of the run time is the characters talking about how horrific the case is, shouting about how they'll catch the killer, or standing in the rain; the grizzly atmosphere of the mystery is portrayed perfectly in each scene. It never once feels like the movie diverted away from the intriguing plot line, even in the scenes that have nothing to do with the case are overshadowed by the brutal killings. And of course we have the famous final scene. I won't go into any detail, but the end of the film is a jaw dropping experience, and creates a memorable end to the story.

One big criticism I do have with the film is there are quite a bit of plot holes throughout. Thinking about the killer's plan for more than a few seconds will lead to many questions about it that don't seem to make sense. But in the end, the genius directing and acting make up for these faults. Truly an amazing experience.",10
12 January 2019,A trash story carried by performances,"I'm going to keep this review short because, as it might surprise you, there is absolutely nothing special about this film worth mentioning.

It's your usual, run-of-the-mill block-buster with great (even amazing) actors, and maybe some role-defining performances. However, that is a matter of budget, and does not make a good film.

With all the hype surrounding this movie and the build-up (which takes about 1 hour 55 minutes out of a total of about 2 hours), watching it is incredibly disappointing. The story makes no sense to any sensible human being, and it has so many holes that it's barely enjoyable.

Shocking for the sake of it, 7/10

What starts out as a classic thriller with detectives being assigned together, despite each others wishes, turns into a gargantuan thriller as well as a life lesson. The life lesson of course is the wisdom to also listen to those with experience, but those with experience also sometimes need to make sure they do not trap themselves inside a specific mindset that otherwise puts blinders on them. The tale is one of cat an mouse, but one that can make you almost agreeable to the killer, to some extent. You're constantly rooting for the good guys while still wondering who we are even chasing.

Through great casting, with remarkable talent, married with an outstanding director vision and on point soundtrack, this film is a product of outstanding entertainment. It's a film that can be watched again and again and you'll always be engaged and fully pulled in. Through the chases, the dark scenes, the self inflicting doubt and mounding questions, this film does not disappoint.",10

5 June 2018,An interesting thriller,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9

1 August 2019,"""Se7en"" is until the end a dark goose bumbing thriller","""Se7en"" is in my eyes a beautyful masterpiece! David Fincher known for ""Alien 3"", ""Fight club"" and recently ""Mind Hunter"" created a well written story with the help of four really talented Actors. Especially Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt fit perfectly in their roles. I enjoyed the neo-noir style. So for those who enjoyed the style of the classic ""Blade runner"" or ""Sin city"", go for it, you will love it! And the plot reminds me sometimes to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" because of one special character. So if you seen all these mentioned Movie´s and enjoyed them all or just two, go for it! But if you don´t saw the movies watch it either.

15 January 2021,"""Se7en one of the best films of the 90s""","Seven (1995) a dark, suspenseful, mystery, thriller. You feel very uneasy watching this film but also so drawn to it. It stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow. The setting is in an unknown city which is visually dark and gloomy, this is shown by a constant grey mist and rain. A rookie cop (Brad Pitt) moves to a hell hole of a city where a serial kill (Kevin Spacey) starts a string of murders over the course of seven days. Veteran cop (Morgan Freeman) who is meant to be retiring at the end of the seven days is also brought in on the case.They work together to solve the first five murders but at the of the film John Doe ( The name of the serial killer) reveals his true plan which leaves the audience shell shocked. This film is a must watch, I would definitely recommend for anybody that is somewhat interested in films.

24 December 2018,In choice of being human or not,"This film is of course one of the best crime stories and in some conditions human can change and be not the creature that they supposed to be. in cold individual facing of calamity one can proceed by being his anti-exist mater of being. and of course an anti-hero can always be opposite of ethical matters and antisocial. so in that situation who can be in that place that can claim,he/she is right. it's just one's choice witch it will make who he is.

6 January 2020,Superb,"""Se7en"" (pronounce as Seven), is a crime/mystery thriller of the highest caliber. What I love most about this glorious film is the marvelous way in which the story unfolds. It borrows so much from detective films of the past and yet it does something altogether new and unseen. Watching this, it is quite easy to tell that the filmmakers really knew what they were doing. Every step of the way is pure suspense; pure thrills!

3 May 2006,its own aesthetic,"That certain noir feel, tweaked so perfectly, keeps all the richness of noir and loses the period specific dialogue that makes classic noir films often feel like cultural artifacts rather than immediately engaging stories that entertain on their own intrinsic merits. Death by sin: gluttonous guy eats too much, lustful guy sexes one too many times, and so on and so on. It's noir without being simply a movie about movies, without simply being an homage to other moviesit stands on its own, it has its own aesthetic, it's just that that aesthetic captures the spirit of luxurious mystery that is associated by film lovers with film noir. Death by sin: gluttonous guy eats too much, lustful guy sexes one too many times, and so on and so on.
